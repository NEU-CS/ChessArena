When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, a knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on b1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's knight on g6 is eyeing the e5 pawn. Black's bishop on g7 is controlling the long diagonal.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e4e5: Pushing the pawn to gain space and open lines for White's pieces\n- c4c5: Pawn push to gain space on the queenside\n- b4b5: Pawn push to gain space on the queenside\n- g3e5: Knight move attacking the e5 pawn\n- d2f3: Rook move attacking the knight\n\nAfter considering these options:\n- e4e5 seems most promising as it:\n  - Opens the e-file for White's rook\n  - Gains space in the center\n  - Doesn't create new weaknesses\n  - Maintains control over d5\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- c4c5 would open the c-file for Black's rook\n- b4b5 is too slow\n- Knight moves don't address the immediate position\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne4e5\n```"
