When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Pawn structure:\n- White's e-pawn is advanced and supported by the king\n- White's b-pawn is isolated but can advance\n- Black's pawns are connected but blocked by White's e-pawn\n\n3. King positions:\n- White king is well-placed at e3, supporting the e-pawn\n- Black king is at d5, trying to stop the e-pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e5e6: Advances the pawn but allows Black's king to capture it (Kd5xe6)\n- b3b4: Advances the b-pawn, creating space and potential for b4-b5\n- Other king moves don't seem to help\n\nThe best move is b3b4 because:\n1. It creates space for the white king to maneuver\n2. It prepares b4-b5, which could open lines for the white king\n3. It doesn't weaken any pawns\n4. It maintains all options for the e-pawn advance\n\nOther moves either don't help or create weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb3b4\n```"
