When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on f1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on g5 is attacking the h5 pawn. White's rook on c7 is under attack by Black's pawn on d6.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c7g7: Rook move attacking the king\n- c7f7: Rook move attacking the king\n- c7e7: Rook move\n- c7d7: Rook move\n- c7b7: Rook move\n- c7a7: Rook move\n- c7c6: Rook move\n- c7c5: Rook move\n- c7c4: Rook move\n- c7c3: Rook move\n- c7c2: Rook move\n- c7c1: Rook move\n- f1e1: King move\n- a1e1: Rook move\n- a1d1: Rook move\n- a1c1: Rook move\n- a1b1: Rook move\n- h5h6: Pawn push\n- h3h4: Pawn push\n- a2a3: Pawn push\n- a2a4: Pawn push\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the h5 pawn and the need to defend the rook on c7. The move h5h6 seems most promising as it:\n- Protects the h5 pawn\n- Opens a line for the white rook on c7\n- Creates potential for a passed pawn on h6\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh5h6\n```"
