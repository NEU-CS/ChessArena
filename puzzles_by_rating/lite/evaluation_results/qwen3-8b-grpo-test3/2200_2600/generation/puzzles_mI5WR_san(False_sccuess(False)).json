When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's King is exposed on g1. Black's King is on e4, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on a2, g2, h3. Black has pawns on a5, g4, h4. The h-pawns are blocked.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's Rook on h5 is very active. Black's Rook on d3 is also active.\n\n5. Threats: Black's Rook on d3 is attacking White's pawn on a2. White needs to address this.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n\n- Rook moves: Most Rook moves maintain pressure or move to different files/ranks\n- King moves: g1f2 or g1h2 would help protect the King\n- Pawn moves: a2a4 would protect the pawn from the Rook\n\nThe most pressing concern is the attack on the a2 pawn. If we don't defend it, Black could capture it with Rxa2.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play a2a4, protecting the pawn from the Rook while also opening the a-file for White's Rook if needed.\n\n```\na2a4\n```"
