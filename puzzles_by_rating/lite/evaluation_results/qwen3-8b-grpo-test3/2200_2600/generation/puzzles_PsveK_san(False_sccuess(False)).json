When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a king and two pawns (g6, h4). White has a king and three pawns (a3, b3, g3). Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: White's king is exposed on f3. Black's king is on h6, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: \n   - Black's pawns: g6 is blocked by White's king, h4 is advanced\n   - White's pawns: a3/b3 are protected, g3 is advanced\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - h6h7: Moves king towards the center but doesn't accomplish much\n   - h6g7: Moves king towards the pawns but still passive\n   - h6h5: Moves king towards the h-pawn\n   - h4g3: Captures the g3 pawn - this is interesting\n   - g6g5: Advances the g-pawn - this is also interesting\n\nThe most promising moves are h4g3 (capturing the pawn) and g6g5 (advancing the pawn). Let's evaluate:\n\nh4g3:\n- Wins a pawn\n- Opens the h-file for Black's king\n- After this capture, White's king is more exposed\n- But it leaves the h4 pawn undefended\n\ng6g5:\n- Advances the pawn towards promotion\n- Creates a passed pawn\n- Doesn't immediately threaten anything\n- But it's a slow move\n\nBetween these, h4g3 seems more active and immediately improves Black's position by winning material while creating new threats. The h4 pawn can be defended by the king if needed.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh4g3\n```"
