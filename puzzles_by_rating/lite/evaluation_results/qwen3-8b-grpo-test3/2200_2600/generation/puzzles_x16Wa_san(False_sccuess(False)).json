When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a Rook and pawns. Black has a Knight, Bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on c2. Black's king is on d6, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on b4, c3, f2, h3. Black has pawns on a6, b7, d5, f5. The b-pawn is isolated for White.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's Rook on c5 is very active. Black's Knight on d6 is well-placed.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- c5c6: Rook move attacking the pawn, but doesn't seem to achieve much\n- c5e5: Rook move attacking the pawn, but again not clear\n- c5d5: Rook move attacking the knight\n- c5b5: Rook move attacking the pawn\n- c2d3: King move towards the center\n- b4b5: Pawn push creating space for the rook\n- h3h4: Pawn push creating space for the king\n\nThe most promising move seems to be b4b5. This:\n- Creates space for the rook on c5\n- Opens the b-file for White's rook\n- Prepares potential b5-b6 push\n- Doesn't weaken White's pawn structure\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb4b5\n```"
