When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has Rook, Bishop, Knight vs Black's Bishop, Knight). White has a passed pawn on e6 that's very advanced.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g7. White's king is on c3, relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's rook on b8 is attacking the knight on c8. White's bishop on d6 is very active.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c8e7: Moves the knight to defend the rook\n- c8d6: Captures the bishop\n- g7h8: Moves king away from potential checks\n- d7f7: Moves pawn to protect the knight\n- a6e2: Knight move attacking the pawn\n\nThe most pressing concern is the knight on c8 being attacked by the rook. If we don't address this, White can win the knight.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- c8d6 seems most appealing as it wins the bishop while defending the knight\n- After c8d6, if White takes the knight with Rxb8, we can play a6e2 attacking the pawn\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc8d6\n```"
