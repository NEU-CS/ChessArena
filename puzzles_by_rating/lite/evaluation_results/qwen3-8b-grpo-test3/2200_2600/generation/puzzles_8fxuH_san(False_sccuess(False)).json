When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on d1. Black's king is on e5, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on b5 and h4. Black has pawns on e4 and d3. The b-pawn is advanced but isolated.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight is well-placed on b3. Black's bishop on b6 is active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- b3c5: Knight move attacking the king, but allows Black's king to capture the knight\n- b3d4: Knight move centralizing it\n- b3a5: Knight move towards the a-pawn\n- d1d2: King move towards the center\n- g4g5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. Moving it towards the center with d1d2 seems most prudent. This:\n- Gets the king out of the corner\n- Maintains flexibility\n- Doesn't create new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new problems. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd1d2\n```"
