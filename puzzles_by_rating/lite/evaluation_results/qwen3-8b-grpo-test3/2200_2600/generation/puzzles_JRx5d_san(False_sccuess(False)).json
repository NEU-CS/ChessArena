When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on f1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's g2 pawn is attacking White's bishop on g3. White needs to address this.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- g3h4: Moves bishop away from attack but doesn't address other issues\n- g3f4: Similar to h4\n- g3h2: Moves bishop to safety but leaves it passive\n- f1e1: Moves king towards the center but doesn't help\n- e5e8: Rook move but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- d7d8: Rook move promoting the pawn (but there's no pawn on d7)\n\nThe most pressing concern is the g2 pawn attacking the bishop. While none of the bishop moves are perfect, g3h2 seems the most flexible:\n- It moves the bishop to safety\n- It maintains control over g2\n- It keeps options open for the bishop\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3h2\n```"
