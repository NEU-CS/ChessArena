When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and knight for a pawn (White has B+N+Q vs Black's Q+R). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on f6. White's king is on h1.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on h4 is eyeing the h-file. Black's rook on f5 is well-placed.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f6f7: Moves king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f6g6: Moves king towards the kingside but still exposed\n- f6e6: Moves king towards the center but away from the rook\n- f5g5: Captures the pawn and opens the g-file for Black's rook\n- g7g5: Pawn move that opens lines for Black's pieces\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's queen on h4. If it moves to h5, it could be dangerous. Also, Black's rook on f5 is well-placed.\n\nThe best move is f5g5, capturing the pawn:\n- It opens the g-file for Black's rook\n- Removes a pawn from in front of White's queen\n- Maintains control over the f5 square\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf5g5\n```"
