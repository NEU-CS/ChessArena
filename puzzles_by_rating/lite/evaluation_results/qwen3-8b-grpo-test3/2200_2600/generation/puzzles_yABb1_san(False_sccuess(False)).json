When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, knight, pawns. Black has a bishop, queen, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g8.\n\n3. Piece activity: White's knight on e5 is very active. Black's bishop on b7 and queen on c7 are well-placed.\n\n4. Threats: White's knight on e5 is attacking the pawn on d7. Black's pawn on d5 is isolated and could be a target.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e5d7: Capturing the pawn with the knight\n- e5c6: Moving the knight to a safe square\n- c5b6: Capturing the pawn with the pawn\n- c1e1: Moving the rook to defend the king\n\nThe most pressing concern is the safety of White's king. The move f1e1 (rook move) would help defend the king while also opening the f-file for potential attacks.\n\nHowever, looking at the legal moves list, I don't see 'f1e1' listed. The closest option is 'f1d1' or 'f1e1' - but since 'f1e1' isn't shown, I'll choose the next best option.\n\nThe move e5d7 (knight takes pawn) seems most promising as it:\n- Wins a pawn\n- Opens lines for White's pieces\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n\nTherefore, my chosen move is:\n\n```\ne5d7\n```"
