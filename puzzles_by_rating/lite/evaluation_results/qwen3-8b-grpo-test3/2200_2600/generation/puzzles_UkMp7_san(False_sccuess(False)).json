When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a bishop and pawn (White has B+B+P+P vs Black's N+P+P). White has a passed e-pawn that's advanced to e6.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g8. White's king is on g2.\n\n3. Threats: White's bishop on h4 is eyeing the g5 pawn. Black's knight on c4 is well-placed but needs to defend against the e-pawn.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- c4e5: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- f7e6: Capturing the pawn with the pawn\n- f4f3: Pushing the pawn to open lines for the knight\n- g7g5: Pushing the pawn to defend against the bishop\n\nThe most pressing concern is the e6 pawn. If it promotes, White will have a decisive material advantage. Therefore, we must address this immediately.\n\nf7e6 (pawn takes pawn) is the most forcing move:\n- It captures the advanced pawn\n- Opens the f-file for Black's rook\n- Maintains control over e6\n- Doesn't allow White to play e7 promoting the pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf7e6\n```"
