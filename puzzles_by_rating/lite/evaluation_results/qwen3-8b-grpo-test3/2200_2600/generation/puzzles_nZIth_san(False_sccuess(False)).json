When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King positions: Black's king is centralized at e7. White's king is at c4, protecting the a6 pawn.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White's a6 pawn is advanced and protected by the knight. Black's pawns are at g7 and h7.\n\n4. Piece activity: Black's knight at b5 is well-placed. White's knight is also active.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- e7d6: King move towards the center\n- b5d6: Knight move attacking the king\n- g7g5: Pawn push creating space\n- h7h5: Pawn push creating space\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's a6 pawn which could promote if not addressed. However, none of the moves directly address this threat.\n\nThe best move is b5d6 (Knight to d6). This:\n- Attacks White's king\n- Opens lines for Black's king to approach the a6 pawn\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Doesn't weaken Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nb5d6\n```"
