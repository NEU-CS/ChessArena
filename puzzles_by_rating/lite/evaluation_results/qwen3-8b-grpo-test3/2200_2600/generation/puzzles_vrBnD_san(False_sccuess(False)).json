When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black is down a queen and rook for a bishop and knight (White has Q+R+R vs Black's R+B+N). White has a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on f7, which is relatively safe.\n\n3. Threats: White's queen on g7 is attacking Black's rook on f8. White's rook on g6 is also a threat.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- e5g6: Capturing the rook with the knight seems most pressing\n- e5c6: Knight move attacking the rook\n- e7d7: Moving the queen to defend the rook\n- f8h8: Moving the rook away from the queen\n\nThe most urgent concern is the attack on the rook on f8. If we don't address this, White can capture the rook with Qxf8.\n\ne5g6 (knight takes rook) seems best because:\n1. It removes the immediate threat to the rook\n2. It wins the rook for a knight\n3. It opens the e5-square for Black's knight\n4. It maintains some counterplay against White's queen\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5g6\n```"
