When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and two pawns. Black has a bishop, two pawns, and a king. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on d3. Black's king is on g5, relatively safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: White has pawns on c4, b4, a3, h4. Black has pawns on b5, g4, h5. The c4-b5 pawn exchange is a potential point of contention.\n\n4. Piece activity: White's knight on b8 is well-placed. Black's bishop on e8 is inactive.\n\n5. Candidate moves:\n- b8d7: Knight move attacking the bishop\n- b8c6: Knight move centralizing\n- b8a6: Knight move towards the edge\n- d3d4: King move towards the center\n- d3c3: King move towards the pawns\n- d3e2: King move towards the edge\n- d3d2: King move towards the edge\n- d3c2: King move towards the edge\n- c4b5: Pawn capture opening the c-file\n- c4c5: Pawn advance\n\nThe most promising move is c4b5 (pawn capture). This:\n- Opens the c-file for White's knight\n- Removes a pawn from b5 that was restricting the knight\n- Creates a passed pawn on b5\n- Opens lines for White's pieces\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc4b5\n```"
