When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on h8.\n\n3. Threats: Black's rook on g8 is eyeing the g-file. White's queen on h3 is close to the king.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h3h6: Queen move attacking the rook\n- c1e3: Bishop move developing the piece\n- f1f4: Rook move controlling the f-file\n- e4e5: Pawn push gaining space\n- c3d5: Knight move centralizing\n\nThe most pressing concern is White's exposed king. The move f1f4 (Rook to f4) would:\n- Protect the king on g1\n- Control the f-file\n- Prepare potential castling\n- Not expose the king further\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate concerns or create new weaknesses. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf1f4\n```"
