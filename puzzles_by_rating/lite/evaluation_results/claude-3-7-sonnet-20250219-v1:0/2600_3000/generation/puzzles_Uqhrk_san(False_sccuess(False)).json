When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, bishop, knight, rook, and 6 pawns. Black has a queen, rook, bishop, and 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe, while Black's king is in the corner with limited protection.\n- Piece activity: White's queen and bishop are actively placed on g6 and h6, creating pressure toward Black's king.\n\nLooking at the position, I notice that White's queen on g6 and bishop on h6 are aimed at Black's kingside. This suggests potential for a mating attack.\n\nLet me check for immediate tactical opportunities:\n1. The bishop on h6 can move to g7+ forcing the king to h7, but I don't see an immediate follow-up.\n2. The queen on g6 can move to g8+, forcing Rxg8, but again no immediate mate.\n\nHowever, I notice that Qg6-h7# would be checkmate if the e8 rook wasn't defending. If I could remove that defender...\n\nLooking at the move g6e8 (Queen takes rook on e8), this would be a queen sacrifice, but after Black recaptures with Qxe8, White can play h6f8 (Bishop to f8), which is checkmate! The bishop controls e7 and g7, the knight controls f7, and Black's king has no escape.\n\nLet me verify this sequence:\n1. Qxe8 (g6e8) - removes the defender\n2. Qxe8 (Black's only move)\n3. Bf8# (h6f8) - checkmate!\n\nThis is a forced mate in 2 moves, which is clearly the best option.\n\n```\ng6e8\n```"
