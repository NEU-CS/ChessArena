When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The white h6 pawn is dangerous and could promote\n2. Black's connected pawns on the queenside are a potential advantage\n3. The kings are in opposition, with White's king on f4 and Black's on f6\n\nKey considerations:\n- Can Black push the queenside pawns to create a passed pawn?\n- Should Black's king stay to defend against the h-pawn or move toward the queenside?\n- Is there a race between Black's queenside pawns and White's h-pawn?\n\nAnalyzing each legal move:\n\n1. King moves (f6f7, f6e7, f6g6, f6e6):\n   - f6f7: Moving away from the h-pawn, could be risky\n   - f6e7: Moving away from both the h-pawn and the queenside\n   - f6g6: Moving closer to the h-pawn, but still can't capture it immediately\n   - f6e6: Moving toward the queenside while still keeping an eye on the h-pawn\n\n2. Pawn moves (b5b4, a5a4):\n   - b5b4: Advances the queenside majority and attacks the c3 pawn\n   - a5a4: Fixes the a3 pawn but doesn't create immediate threats\n\nThe critical decision is whether to advance the queenside pawns or position the king better.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe advancing the queenside pawns is most urgent to create counterplay against White's h-pawn. Between the two pawn moves, b5b4 is stronger as it puts pressure on White's c3 pawn and advances our pawn majority.\n\n```\nb5b4\n```"
