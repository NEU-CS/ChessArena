When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the current situation:\n\n1) Material count:\n   - White has a rook, bishop, queen, and king\n   - Black has a rook, bishop, queen, knight, and king\n   - Black is up a knight, which is a significant material advantage\n\n2) Threats and dangers:\n   - White's queen on g5 and bishop on e5 are creating pressure\n   - The e5 bishop is attacking my rook on b8\n   - White's queen on g5 is threatening my kingside\n   - White has connected rooks on the first rank\n\n3) King safety:\n   - My king on h8 is somewhat exposed with limited defenders\n   - White might be setting up an attack on my king\n\n4) Candidate moves:\n   - I should consider moves that improve my king safety\n   - I should look for counterattacks or ways to neutralize White's threats\n   - I could consider exchanging pieces to simplify toward an endgame where my material advantage matters more\n\nLooking at specific candidate moves:\n- h7h6: This would attack White's queen, forcing it to move\n- d7e6: Trading queens could be beneficial given my material advantage\n- e8e7: Connecting my rooks and preparing to use them actively\n- h8g8: Improving king safety by moving away from the h-file\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe h7h6 is the best move. It attacks White's queen, forcing it to retreat, which will relieve pressure on my kingside. After White's queen moves, I can continue developing my pieces and consolidating my position with my material advantage.\n\n```\nh7h6\n```"
