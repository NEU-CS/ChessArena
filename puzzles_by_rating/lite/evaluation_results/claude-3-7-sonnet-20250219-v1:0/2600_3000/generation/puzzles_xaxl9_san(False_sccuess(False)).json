If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White's immediate threat is e7-e8Q which would be devastating\n2. Black needs to either prevent the promotion or create counterplay\n3. The rook is Black's most powerful piece and should be used effectively\n\nLet's analyze the candidate moves:\n\n1. Preventing promotion:\n   - The rook can't directly prevent e7-e8 since it's on the c-file\n   - The king can't reach e8 in time\n\n2. Creating counterplay:\n   - The rook could attack White's king with c6-c7+\n   - The rook could potentially create threats on the 1st rank with c6-c1\n\n3. King moves:\n   - a8-b7 would walk into a fork with e7-e8Q+, losing the rook\n\nLooking at c6c7+:\n- After c6c7+, White must move the king\n- If Ke7-d8, Black can play c7-c8+, and after Kd8-e7, c8-e8+ capturing the pawn\n- If Ke7-f8, Black can play c7-c8+ and then capture the pawn\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and effective option, as it uses the rook to attack the king and potentially stop the promotion.\n\n```\nc6c7\n```"
