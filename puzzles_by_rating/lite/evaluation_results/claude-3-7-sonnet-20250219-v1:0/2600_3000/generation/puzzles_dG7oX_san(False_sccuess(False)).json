If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

White's c7 pawn is one move away from promotion\n2. My f2 pawn can promote immediately\n3. My knight on c8 is under attack by the c7 pawn\n4. My king on f3 seems safe for now\n\nThe most critical decision is whether to promote my pawn immediately or address White's promotion threat.\n\nIf I promote my pawn to a queen with f2f1q, I gain a powerful piece. However, White will promote on the next move with c7c8q, and we'd have queens on both sides.\n\nLet me check if I can prevent White's promotion. My knight on c8 can move to several squares, but none prevent the pawn promotion directly.\n\nLooking at king moves, none seem to create immediate threats or prevent White's promotion.\n\nThe most decisive action is to promote my pawn immediately. Since I can choose the promotion piece, a queen is clearly the strongest option as it gives me the most versatility and power.\n\nAfter f2f1q, I'll have a queen and knight against White's bishop and soon-to-be-queen. This should give me good winning chances, especially if I can coordinate my pieces effectively.\n\n```\nf2f1q\n```"
