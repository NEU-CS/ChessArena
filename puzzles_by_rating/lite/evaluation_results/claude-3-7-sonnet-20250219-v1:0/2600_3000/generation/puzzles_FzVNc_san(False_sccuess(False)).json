When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, a knight, and 5 pawns. Black has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and 6 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king on g2 is somewhat exposed. Black's king on h8 is in the corner with some pawn protection.\n- Piece activity: White has active pieces, particularly the knight on d7 and bishop on b6 which are deep in Black's territory.\n- Threats: Black's queen on h5 and bishop on f4 are creating some pressure.\n\nLet me look for tactical opportunities:\n\n1. The knight on d7 is attacking the rook on c8, but it's defended.\n2. The knight on d7 could potentially deliver a check by moving to e8, but this doesn't seem immediately decisive.\n3. The bishop on b6 is attacking the a-pawn and could potentially move to capture on f2.\n4. White's queen on d3 could potentially align with Black's queen for a discovery.\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- c7e8 (Nd7-e8): Knight check, but after Kg8, no clear follow-up.\n- b6f2 (Bb6-f2): Captures a pawn but loses the bishop to Qxf2+.\n- d3g3 (Qd3-g3): Creates a threat against Black's queen and g7 pawn.\n- f1f4 (Rf1-f4): Captures the bishop, but loses the rook to Qxf4.\n- a2g8 (Ba2-g8): Interesting bishop sacrifice that could lead to mate.\n\nLet me examine Ba2-g8 more closely. If Ba2-g8, Black must take Rxg8, then Nd7-f6+ forces Kg8, and Qd3-g3 threatens mate. This looks very promising.\n\nLet's verify: Ba2-g8, Rxg8, Nf6+, Kg8, Qg3 threatening mate on g7. Black's only defense would be Qg6, but then Qxg6 hxg6, and White is up material with a winning position.\n\nThe bishop sacrifice on g8 leads to a decisive advantage.\n\n```\na2g8\n```"
