When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, 4 pawns.\n- Black is up a bishop, which is a significant material advantage.\n- The black king is somewhat exposed, while the white king is also not well protected.\n- Black's queen on c4 is active and threatening.\n- Black's bishop on d3 is also well placed.\n\nLet me consider the candidate moves:\n\n1. Queen moves:\n   - c4d5: Captures a pawn, but might expose the queen to danger.\n   - c4b5: Captures a pawn, similar to c4d5.\n   - c4h4/g4/f4/e4/d4/b4/a4: Horizontal queen moves with various threats.\n   - c4c3: Moves queen down, potentially threatening the white king.\n   - c4b3/a2: Diagonal queen moves.\n\n2. Bishop moves:\n   - d3h7/g6/f5/e4/e2/c2/f1/b1: Various bishop moves with different threats.\n\n3. King moves:\n   - g8h8/f8/h7/f7: King repositioning, generally defensive.\n\n4. Pawn move:\n   - g7g6: Advances a pawn.\n\nLooking at the position more deeply, I notice that the white king on c1 is potentially vulnerable. The black queen on c4 and bishop on d3 are both aimed in that direction. This suggests a possible checkmate or decisive material gain.\n\nLet me check if there's a direct checkmate:\n- The bishop on d3 is controlling the b1 square.\n- If the queen moves to c2, it would be checkmate as the king has no escape squares.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc4c2\n```\n\nWait, I need to double-check if c4c2 is in the list of legal moves... I don't see it listed. Let me reconsider.\n\nLooking at the legal moves again, I see that the queen can go to c3 (c4c3), which threatens the c2 square. This would set up a potential checkmate next move with Qc2#.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc4c3\n```"
