When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a queen, 4 pawns. White has a queen, 4 pawns. Material is equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on b8, White's on c1.\n- Pawn structure: White has connected passed pawns on d5 and e5, which are dangerous.\n- Black's queen on g4 is active and could potentially create threats.\n\nLet's examine key tactical considerations:\n1. Is there a checkmate threat?\n2. Can I win material?\n3. Can I improve my position significantly?\n\nLooking at queen moves from g4:\n- g4g1 would check the white king, but after Kd2, there's no follow-up.\n- g4d1 would check the white king, but after Kxd1, there's no advantage.\n- g4e2 threatens the white queen, but White can simply capture with Qxe2.\n- g4f3 doesn't create immediate threats.\n\nThe most promising idea seems to be g4g2, threatening the b2 pawn while maintaining pressure. If White defends with Qb3, Black can consider c4c3, undermining White's pawn structure.\n\nAnother strong candidate is c4c3, directly attacking White's pawn structure and potentially creating passed pawns on the queenside.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the most decisive move is:\n\n```\ng4g2\n```\n\nThis move puts pressure on White's position, threatens the b2 pawn, and maintains an active queen position while keeping tactical possibilities open."
