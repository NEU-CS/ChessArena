When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, bishop, queen, and pawns.\n- Black's king is in the corner at h8, potentially vulnerable.\n- White has a bishop on e6 that's attacking toward the black king.\n- Black has a bishop on f1 that has just captured something, threatening White's king.\n- Black's queen on h4 is also threatening White's king area.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Black's bishop on f1 is an immediate threat that needs to be addressed.\n2. There could be checkmate opportunities against Black's king.\n3. White's queen on d5 is well-positioned for attack.\n\nLet me check for immediate threats and opportunities:\n\nThe most urgent issue is Black's bishop on f1, which is attacking White's king. I need to capture it or move the king.\n\nLooking at potential attacking moves, I notice that Qd5-h5 would create a direct attack on Black's king with the bishop on e6 also pointing in that direction.\n\nLet me check if Qh5 creates a checkmate threat:\n- The black king is on h8\n- White queen would be on h5\n- White bishop is on e6\n- This creates a powerful attack, but Black's queen on h4 could potentially defend.\n\nLet's examine Qh5 more carefully:\n- It attacks the black king\n- It threatens to capture the black queen\n- It works with the bishop on e6 to create mating threats\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the strongest move is to move the queen to h5, creating immediate threats against Black's king and queen.\n\n```\nd5h5\n```"
