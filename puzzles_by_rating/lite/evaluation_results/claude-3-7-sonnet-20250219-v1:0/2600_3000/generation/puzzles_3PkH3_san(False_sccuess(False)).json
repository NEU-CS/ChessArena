When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, rook, and 4 pawns. Black has a queen, bishop, and 6 pawns.\n- White is up a rook for a bishop and pawn, so has a material advantage.\n- Black's queen on f6 is active, and the bishop on b4 is controlling some important squares.\n- White's queen on d5 is centralized and powerful.\n- Black's king on g7 could potentially be vulnerable.\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **Queen moves**: \n   - d5f7+ looks very strong - it's a check that attacks the king and pawn simultaneously.\n   - d5e6 threatens the f6 queen.\n\n2. **Rook moves**:\n   - e3e6 would attack the black queen.\n\n3. **King and pawn moves** don't seem particularly strong in this position.\n\nLet's analyze the most promising moves:\n\n**d5f7+**: This is a check that forces the king to move. After Kxf7, White can play e3e7+ and then capture the queen on f6. This looks like a winning combination.\n\n**d5e6**: This directly attacks the queen. If Black moves the queen, White can potentially capture the f7 pawn with check.\n\n**e3e6**: This attacks the queen, but Black can simply capture with Qxe6, and White doesn't gain much.\n\nAfter careful analysis, d5f7+ stands out as the strongest move. It initiates a winning combination:\n1. Qxf7+ Kxf7\n2. Re7+ followed by capturing the queen\n\nThis should give White a decisive advantage.\n\n```\nd5f7\n```"
