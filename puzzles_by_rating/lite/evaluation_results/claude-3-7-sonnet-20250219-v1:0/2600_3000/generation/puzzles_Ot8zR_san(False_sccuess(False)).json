When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, rook, rook, bishop, knight, and 3 pawns\n- Black has a rook, rook, bishop, queen, and 3 pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but White has an active queen on a7 threatening Black's position\n- Black's king is on d7, potentially vulnerable\n- White has attacking chances with the queen on a7\n\nLet me examine tactical opportunities:\n\n1. The queen on a7 is attacking the bishop on b7 and threatening the e7 pawn\n2. The rook on e1 could deliver a check by moving to e7\n3. The bishop on b4 is attacking along the a3-f8 diagonal\n\nLooking at immediate threats:\n- e1e7+ looks very strong as it's a check that forces the king to move\n- After e1e7+, if Kd7xe7, then Qa7xe7+ wins the rook on d8\n- If Black responds to e1e7+ with Kd7c6, then Qa7c5+ would be checkmate\n\nThis looks like a decisive combination. Let's verify:\n- e1e7+ forces Kd7xe7 (or Kd7c6 leading to immediate mate)\n- After Kd7xe7, Qa7xe7+ wins material and leaves Black in a hopeless position\n\nThe move e1e7+ initiates a winning combination and is clearly the best move in this position.\n\n```\ne1e7\n```"
