When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If White promotes to a queen, Black will be in serious trouble. I need to address this immediately.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n1. I could capture the g7 pawn with my rook: a8g8\n2. I could try to promote my a3 pawn: a3a2\n3. I could move my king to various squares\n\nLet's analyze these options:\n\nOption 1: a8g8 (capturing the g7 pawn)\nThis prevents White's immediate promotion threat. After this, White might play Ra7+ forcing my king to move, but I'll have time to advance my a-pawn.\n\nOption 2: a3a2\nThis advances my pawn one step closer to promotion, but White will promote to a queen on the next move with g7g8Q, and I'll be in a lost position.\n\nOption 3: King moves\nNone of these address the immediate threat of White's pawn promotion.\n\nThe critical factor here is stopping White's pawn promotion while advancing my own passed pawn. The move a8g8 accomplishes the first goal and allows me to pursue the second on subsequent moves.\n\n```\na8g8\n```"
