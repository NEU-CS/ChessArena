When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

However, after Qxe4, Black threatens both the g3 knight and potentially checkmate patterns.\n\n2. **c1h6**: This bishop move attacks the g7 pawn and could create some counterplay.\n\n3. **b1e4**: The queen can capture the knight, but this would be a powerful centralization.\n\n4. **g3g4**: This move attacks the queen, forcing it to retreat, and might relieve some pressure.\n\n5. **c1g5**: This develops the bishop with tempo, attacking the queen.\n\nThe most concerning issue is the bishop on h3 threatening White's king. I should address this threat immediately.\n\nLooking at the position more deeply, I see that **c1g5** attacks Black's queen on f5, forcing it to move. This gives White time to address other threats. After the queen moves, White can potentially play g3-g4 to attack the bishop on h3.\n\nThis is a critical position where I need to create counterplay while addressing the threats against my king.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the best move is:\n\n```\nc1g5\n```\n\nThis move develops the bishop with tempo by attacking the queen, forcing Black to retreat and giving White time to organize a defense against the threats."
