When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Both kings are far from each other\n2. White's e5 pawn is advanced and could be a passed pawn if Black's e6 pawn moves\n3. Black's c4 pawn is advanced and could promote if not addressed\n\nCandidate moves analysis:\n1. King moves (d2e3, d2c3, d2e2, d2c2, d2e1, d2d1, d2c1):\n   - Moving toward c4 pawn seems logical to stop its advance\n   - d2c3 directly approaches the c4 pawn\n   - d2e3 improves king position but doesn't directly address c4\n\n2. Pawn moves (g3g4, h2h3, f2f3, h2h4, f2f4):\n   - g3g4 would fix the g-pawn on the same color as Black's g5, creating a potential target\n   - f2f4 could challenge Black's g5 pawn\n   - h2h4 could potentially undermine Black's g5 pawn\n\nThe most critical issue is Black's c4 pawn, which is advanced and threatening to promote. White should prioritize stopping this pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd2c3\n```\n\nThis move directly approaches Black's c4 pawn, preventing its advance while maintaining control of the position. It's the most direct way to address the immediate threat while maintaining White's chances to push the e5 pawn later."
