When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This looks promising as it forces White's king to move.\n\n7. **c7c5**: Directly challenging the d5 pawn, creating tension in the center.\n\n8. **b7b5**: Creates a passed pawn on the queenside after potential exchanges.\n\nThe most critical decision is whether to advance the e-pawn with e5e4+ or to create counterplay on the queenside.\n\nAfter e5e4+, White's king must move (likely to e3 or g3). This advances Black's passed pawn and forces White to deal with it. The e-pawn could become a significant threat if it advances further.\n\nLooking at the pawn structure, advancing the e-pawn seems most forcing and creates the most immediate threats. The check also gains tempo.\n\n```\ne5e4\n```"
