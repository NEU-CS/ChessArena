When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'm playing as Black in this position. Let me analyze the board carefully.\n\nCurrent position assessment:\n- Material: Equal (both sides have a rook and 4 pawns)\n- King position: White's king is on e4, Black's on e7\n- Pawn structure: White has connected pawns on e5 and f5, Black has pawns on b7, c6, e6, g7, and h6\n- Rook activity: White's rook is on b4, Black's on a5\n\nLet me evaluate the key aspects of this position:\n1. The e5 and f5 pawns are advanced and potentially dangerous\n2. My rook on a5 is active but not directly influencing the center\n3. The pawn on c6 is blocked by White's b6 pawn\n4. The kings are relatively close to each other\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **a5e5** - Capturing White's advanced pawn would eliminate a key threat and gain material. After this, White would likely recapture with f5e6, but then I'd have removed both central pawns.\n\n2. **g7g5** - This would challenge White's f5 pawn, but after fxg6 en passant, White would have a dangerous passed pawn.\n\n3. **a5a8/a7/a6** - Moving the rook along the a-file doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n\n4. **c6c5** - This would challenge White's pawn structure but doesn't seem immediately effective.\n\n5. **King moves** - None seem particularly useful at this moment.\n\nThe move **a5e5** stands out as clearly best. It captures a dangerous advanced pawn and forces White to recapture, after which the position would be more balanced. This eliminates White's strong central pawns and improves my position significantly.\n\n```\na5e5\n```"
