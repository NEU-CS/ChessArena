When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Queen moves:\n   - d4g7 looks like a checkmate threat, but after Qxg7, Black's king can escape to f8\n   - d4f6 threatens the g7 pawn with discovered attack from the bishop on f1\n   - d4e5 attacks the knight on e4\n\n2. Knight moves:\n   - f3e5 would attack Black's queen\n\nLooking at d4f6, this move attacks the g7 pawn with the queen while also creating a discovered attack from the bishop on f1. If Black's queen moves to defend g7, White can capture the knight on e4. This looks very strong.\n\nLet me verify there are no better options:\n- d4g7 isn't checkmate as the king can escape to f8\n- f3e5 attacking the queen is met by Qxe5\n- Other queen moves don't seem to create immediate threats\n\nThe move d4f6 creates a double attack - threatening the g7 pawn and the knight on e4. This is a strong tactical shot that should win material.\n\n```\nd4f6\n```"
