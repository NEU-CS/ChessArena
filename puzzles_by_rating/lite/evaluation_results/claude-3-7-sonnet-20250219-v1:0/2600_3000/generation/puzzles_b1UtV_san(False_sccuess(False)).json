When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, rook, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on c7, somewhat exposed. White's king is on g1, relatively safe.\n- Piece activity: Black's rooks are connected on the e-file and d-file. White has a knight on a7 and queen on a5.\n- Threats: White's queen on a5 and knight on a7 are creating pressure.\n\nLet me examine each legal move:\n\n1. **c7b8**: King moves to b8\n   - Escapes the potential knight fork if the knight moves to c6\n   - Gets away from the a-file where White's queen is\n   - Downside: Disconnects from defending the c6 pawn\n\n2. **c7d7**: King moves to d7\n   - Stays connected to the c6 pawn\n   - Moves away from the a7 knight\n   - Potential issue: Could be vulnerable to checks along the d-file\n\n3. **b7b6**: Queen moves to b6\n   - Attacks White's queen on a5\n   - Forces White to move the queen or trade queens\n   - If queens are traded, simplifies the position which could be good for Black\n   - Protects the b5 pawn\n\nAfter analyzing these options, b7b6 stands out as the strongest move. It creates a direct threat to White's queen, forcing a response. If White trades queens, the endgame should be favorable for Black with connected rooks. If White retreats the queen, Black maintains the initiative.\n\n```\nb7b6\n```"
