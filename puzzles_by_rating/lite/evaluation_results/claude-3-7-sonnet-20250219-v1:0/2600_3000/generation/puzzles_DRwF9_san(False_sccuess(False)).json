When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- White has a rook on c7 threatening Black's b7 pawn.\n- White's queen on g5 and knight on e4 are actively placed.\n- Black's queen on a2 is active but potentially vulnerable.\n- Black's king position seems somewhat exposed.\n\nLet me consider key tactical elements:\n1. Threats against my king? White's queen on g5 is eyeing the kingside.\n2. My queen on a2 - is it safe? Can I use it for counterplay?\n3. Can I create immediate threats?\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- King safety moves like g8h8 or g8f7\n- Queen moves - particularly checking if a2f2 creates threats\n- Defensive moves to protect the b7 pawn\n- Counter-attacking possibilities\n\nThe move a2f2 stands out as it attacks White's king directly. Let me check if this is a strong attack or if White has adequate defenses.\n\nIf a2f2, White must respond to the check. The king can move to h1, or White could block with g2. If White moves the king, Black maintains the initiative and can follow up with additional threats.\n\nThis check also pulls White's pieces away from their attacking positions, giving Black time to reorganize.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the queen check appears to be the strongest move, creating immediate pressure and seizing the initiative.\n\n```\na2f2\n```"
