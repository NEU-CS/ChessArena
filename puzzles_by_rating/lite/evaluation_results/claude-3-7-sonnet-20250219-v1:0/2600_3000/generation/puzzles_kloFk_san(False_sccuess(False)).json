When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The c3 pawn is a major asset that's close to promotion\n2. Black's queen and knight are actively placed\n3. White's king is exposed and could be vulnerable to attack\n\nLet's examine some candidate moves:\n\n1. **d5e3** - Knight to e3 would fork White's queen and rook, winning material\n2. **b6b3** - Rook to b3 would protect the c3 pawn and threaten the a3 pawn\n3. **a5a3** - Queen captures pawn, threatening the b-pawn next\n4. **c3c2** - Advancing the passed pawn (but this isn't in the legal moves list, so the pawn must be blocked)\n\nLooking at the knight move d5e3 more carefully - this would be a powerful fork attacking both White's queen on c1 and rook on g1. After White moves the queen, Black can capture the rook. This would be a decisive material advantage.\n\nThe move **d5e3** (knight from d5 to e3) creates a powerful fork and appears to be the strongest move in this position.\n\n```\nd5e3\n```"
