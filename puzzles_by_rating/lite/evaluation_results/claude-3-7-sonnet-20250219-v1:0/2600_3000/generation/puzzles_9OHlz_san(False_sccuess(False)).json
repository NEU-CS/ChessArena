When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King activity and position\n2. Pawn structure and potential passed pawns\n3. Potential breakthrough possibilities\n\nLet's analyze the candidate moves:\n\n1. King moves (e3f4, e3f3, e3d3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2):\n   - e3f4 would contest the f5 pawn but could be risky as Black might play g7-g5 later\n   - e3d3 or e3d2 moves away from the kingside where action might develop\n   - e3f3 stays centralized but doesn't make immediate progress\n   - e3f2 and e3e2 retreat, which seems unnecessary\n\n2. Pawn moves:\n   - d4c5 captures a pawn but allows Black to recapture with bxc5\n   - d4d5+ pushes toward Black's king and gains space\n   - h3h4 fixes the h5 pawn and prevents Black from advancing it\n   - g3g4 attacks the f5 pawn and could create a passed pawn\n\nThe most promising moves seem to be d4c5, d4d5+, and g3g4.\n\n- d4c5: After bxc5, White loses a pawn for no compensation\n- d4d5+: Forces Black's king to move, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- g3g4: Attacks the f5 pawn. If fxg4, hxg4 creates a passed g-pawn. If Black doesn't capture, White can play gxf5+ gaining a pawn.\n\nAfter careful analysis, g3g4 appears to be the strongest move. It attacks Black's f5 pawn and creates winning chances by potentially creating a passed pawn.\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
