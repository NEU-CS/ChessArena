When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a rook, knight, and queen vs White's two rooks, bishop, and queen. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on g8 with some pawn protection. White's king is exposed on e2.\n- Threats: White's queen on f5 and bishop on d5 are attacking Black's position. Black's knight on g4 and queen on h1 are active pieces.\n\nI notice Black's queen is on h1, which is a very strong position threatening White's king. This suggests there might be checkmate opportunities.\n\nLet's examine potential winning moves:\n1. Knight moves:\n   - g4f2 would be a knight fork of White's king and rook, which is very strong\n   - g4e3 would check the king\n   - g4h2 threatens White's pawn\n\n2. Queen moves:\n   - h1g2 threatens checkmate\n   - h1e1 captures a rook with check\n\nLooking at g4f2 (knight fork): This would fork White's king and rook, winning material.\n\nLooking at h1g2: This threatens checkmate. If White's king moves to d3, Black can play Qf3+ followed by Qf1#.\n\nLooking at h1e1: This captures a rook with check, forcing the king to move, after which Black can follow up with more checks.\n\nThe most decisive move appears to be h1g2, threatening an immediate checkmate that White cannot easily defend against. After Qg2+, White must move the king, allowing Black to deliver more checks leading to checkmate.\n\n```\nh1g2\n```"
