When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a rook, bishop, and 5 pawns (10 points). So Black is down 3 points.\n- King safety: Black's king is on e3, somewhat exposed. White's king is on f1.\n- Piece activity: Black has a rook on g2 that's very active and threatening White's position. The knight on h4 is also active.\n- Pawn structure: Black has a passed d-pawn on d4 which could be valuable.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Black's rook on g2 is extremely powerful, controlling the 2nd rank\n2. White's a6 pawn is about to promote\n3. Black's king is in the center and could be vulnerable\n4. Black's d4 pawn is advanced and could be a threat\n\nLet me consider the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **g2g1+**: Checking the white king. After Kf1-e2, Black can play Rg1-g2+ again, forcing a perpetual check.\n\n2. **g2f2+**: Direct check to the king, but after Kf1-e1, White escapes.\n\n3. **e3d2**: Attacking White's c2 pawn, but this moves the king away from defending the d4 pawn.\n\n4. **g2g8**: Preparing to stop White's a-pawn from promoting.\n\n5. **d4d3**: Not in the legal moves list, so the pawn can't advance further yet.\n\nThe most critical threat is White's a6 pawn which is about to promote. I need to address this immediately.\n\nLooking at the position more deeply, I see that if I play g2g8, I can stop the a-pawn from promoting. However, White could play Rd5-a5 to support the pawn.\n\nThe most forcing line appears to be g2g1+ which gives check. After Kf1-e2, I can play Rg1-g2+ again, forcing a perpetual check. This would secure a draw in a position where I'm down material.\n\nGiven that I'm down material and White has a dangerous passed pawn, securing a draw through perpetual check seems to be the best practical decision.\n\n```\ng2g1\n```"
