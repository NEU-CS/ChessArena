When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook, bishop, knight, queen, and pawns. Black has two rooks, queen, bishop, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe. Black's king is also reasonably protected but could be vulnerable.\n- Piece activity: White has active pieces with the rook on d5 and bishop on g5 putting pressure on Black's position.\n- Threats: I notice Black's knight on c4 is attacking White's e-pawn, and White's queen on h4 is creating pressure on the kingside.\n\nLet me look for tactical opportunities:\n1. The bishop on g5 is attacking Black's queen on e7.\n2. The rook on d5 is creating pressure along the 5th rank.\n3. White's queen on h4 combined with other pieces could create mating threats.\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- g5f6: Capturing the g6 bishop with check looks very strong\n- h4h7: Queen attacking the h7 pawn\n- d5f5: Rook move threatening the f6 bishop\n- g5h6: Bishop move attacking the h7 pawn\n\nThe move Bxf6 (g5f6) stands out as particularly strong. It captures a bishop with check, forcing the king to recapture (as moving the king elsewhere would allow Qh7#). After Kxf6, White would have a powerful attack with the queen and rook against the exposed king.\n\nAfter 1. Bxf6 Kxf6, White could follow with 2. Qh6+ Kf7 3. Rd7, attacking the queen and threatening mate.\n\nThis is clearly the most forcing and powerful option, creating immediate threats against Black's king.\n\n```\ng5f6\n```"
