When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, bishop, and 1 pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is exposed on b4, Black's king is on e8.\n- Piece activity: White's rook is active on h7, threatening the 7th rank. Black's rook is on e4, and bishop on d1.\n\nLet's evaluate the key threats and opportunities:\n1. Black's rook on e4 is threatening White's bishop on c4.\n2. White's rook on h7 is very active and can potentially deliver checkmate or win material.\n3. Black's bishop on d1 is attacking White's b3 square.\n\nCandidate moves analysis:\n1. **h7h8**: Moves the rook to the back rank, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n2. **h7e7+**: Checks the Black king, forcing it to move, potentially setting up a skewer.\n3. **b4c5**: Moves the king away from the bishop's attack but abandons defense of the c4 bishop.\n4. **h4h5**: Advances a pawn but doesn't address immediate threats.\n\nThe most promising move appears to be **h7e7+**, checking the Black king. After Black's king moves (likely to d8), White's rook would be attacking Black's rook on e4. This creates a powerful tactical threat.\n\nLet me verify this is the best option by checking for any immediate checkmate opportunities or better tactical shots.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the strongest move is to check the Black king with the rook, forcing the king to move and setting up a capture of Black's rook.\n\n```\nh7e7\n```"
