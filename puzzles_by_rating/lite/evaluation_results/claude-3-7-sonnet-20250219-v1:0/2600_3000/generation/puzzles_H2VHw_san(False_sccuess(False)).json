If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a knight and two pawns (f7, h3).\n- White's f7 pawn is about to promote, which is an immediate threat.\n- The white king is on e6, and the black king is on h7.\n- White's knight on e5 is controlling key squares.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. White's most dangerous threat is promoting the f7 pawn to a queen.\n2. I need to either stop this promotion or find a stronger counterplay.\n\nLet's examine my options:\n\n1. **Bishop moves**: Can I capture the f7 pawn?\n   - b4f8: This doesn't capture the pawn but blocks its promotion path.\n   - Other bishop moves don't address the immediate threat.\n\n2. **King moves**:\n   - h7h8, h7g7, h7h6: None of these stop the pawn promotion.\n\n3. **Pawn moves**:\n   - g6g5: Doesn't address the immediate threat.\n   - h5h4: Doesn't address the immediate threat.\n\nThe move b4f8 stands out as it prevents the immediate promotion threat. Let's check if there are any better alternatives:\n\nIf I play b4f8, White might play Kxf8, and then I'd need to promote my own pawns quickly. The g6 pawn is blocked by White's knight, but the h5 pawn could advance.\n\nAre there any tactical opportunities I'm missing? Let's check if I can create threats against White's king or knight:\n- None of my bishop moves create immediate threats that outweigh White's promotion threat.\n- My pawns can't create immediate threats either.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best move is to block the pawn promotion with:\n\n```\nb4f8\n```\n\nThis prevents White's immediate winning threat and gives me the best chance to fight for a draw or even win if White makes a mistake."
