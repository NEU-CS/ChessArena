When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This would win a rook for free, giving White a significant material advantage.\n\n2. **c6c7+** - Queen check that forces the king to move, but doesn't win material immediately.\n\n3. **c6c8** - Threatening mate, but Black can block with the rook.\n\n4. **c6f6+** - Queen check that attacks the king, but the king can simply move to e7 or e8.\n\nAnalyzing c6d7 more deeply:\n- After capturing the rook, Black would likely respond with something like Qxd7\n- White would then be up a full rook, which is a decisive advantage\n- There are no immediate tactics for Black to recover the material\n\nThis is clearly the strongest move as it wins material without any compensation for Black. The rook is completely undefended, and taking it gives White a winning advantage.\n\n```\nc6d7\n```"
