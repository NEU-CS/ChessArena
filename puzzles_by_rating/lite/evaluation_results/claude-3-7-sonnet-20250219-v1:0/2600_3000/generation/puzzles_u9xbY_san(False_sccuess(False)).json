When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a bishop, a rook, and several pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on c4, somewhat exposed. White's king is on h2, relatively safe.\n- Pawn structure: Black has several pawns that could potentially promote.\n- Piece activity: Black's rook on g4 is active, and the knight on d5 controls several squares.\n\nLet me evaluate some candidate moves:\n\n1. **g4g3**: This threatens the white pawn on g3 and puts pressure on White's king. However, White can simply recapture with the king.\n\n2. **g4f4**: This attacks White's f2 pawn, creating a direct threat.\n\n3. **d5e3**: This knight move would fork White's rook and f-pawn, winning material.\n\n4. **d5f4**: This knight move protects the f5 pawn and attacks the h3 pawn.\n\n5. **c4b3**: King move that doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n\nLooking more deeply at **d5e3**, this move creates a fork between White's rook on d1 and the pawn on f2. White would have to choose between losing the rook or the pawn. This is clearly winning for Black.\n\nLet me double-check if there are any defensive resources for White after d5e3:\n- White can't move the rook to protect the pawn\n- White can't move the pawn forward as it's blocked\n- White can't protect both the rook and pawn simultaneously\n\nTherefore, the knight fork with d5e3 is decisive and the best move in this position.\n\n```\nd5e3\n```"
