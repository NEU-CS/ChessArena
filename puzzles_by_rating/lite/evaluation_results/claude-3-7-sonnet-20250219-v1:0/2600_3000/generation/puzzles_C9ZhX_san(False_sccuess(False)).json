When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and several pawns. Black has a queen, a rook, a bishop, and several pawns. Material is roughly even.\n- King safety: White's king is on h1 with some pawn protection. Black's king is on e7, somewhat exposed.\n- Threats: White's queen is on h8, potentially threatening Black's position.\n\nLet me examine the most promising moves:\n\n1. **Queen moves (h8g8, h8f8, etc.)**: \n   - The queen is already active on h8, but could potentially create more immediate threats.\n\n2. **Bishop moves (g2b7, g2c6, etc.)**:\n   - g2e4 would attack Black's queen on f5, forcing it to move.\n   - g2b7 would attack Black's pawn on b7.\n\n3. **Rook moves**: \n   - Could potentially be used to support an attack.\n\n4. **Pawn moves**:\n   - e5e6+ would check Black's king, forcing a response.\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities, I see that e5e6+ is a check that forces Black's king to move. After the king moves, we could potentially create more threats.\n\nAnother strong option is g2e4, attacking Black's queen. If the queen moves, we maintain pressure.\n\nHowever, I notice something even stronger: the Black king is on e7, and our queen is on h8. If we move our bishop to c6 (g2c6), we create a discovered check from our queen while simultaneously attacking the rook on g6. This is a powerful double attack.\n\nAfter g2c6+, Black's king must move. Then we can capture the rook on g6 with our queen, gaining material.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng2c6\n```\n\nThis creates a discovered check and attacks the rook on g6, leading to material gain after Black responds to the check."
