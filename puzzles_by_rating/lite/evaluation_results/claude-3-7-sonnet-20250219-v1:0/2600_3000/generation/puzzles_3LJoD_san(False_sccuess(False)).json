When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I need to analyze this position carefully as Black. Let me assess the material and positional factors first.\n\nMaterial count:\n- White has a rook, bishop, and 6 pawns\n- Black has two rooks, a bishop, and 6 pawns\n\nSo material is roughly equal, with Black having a slight advantage of a rook vs. bishop.\n\nKey positional elements:\n1. White's bishop on g7 is attacking my king\n2. White's f6 pawn is advanced and threatening\n3. My king on g8 is somewhat exposed\n4. I have two rooks and a bishop that need better coordination\n\nLet me analyze some candidate moves:\n\n1. **g8h7** - Moving the king away from the bishop's attack, but might be walking into a trap if White has tactical threats.\n\n2. **c7d6** - Developing my bishop to a more active square, protecting the d5 pawn and gaining more control.\n\n3. **c7f4** - An aggressive bishop move that attacks White's rook.\n\n4. **c5c4** - Advancing my central pawn to gain space and challenge White's structure.\n\n5. **e8e4** - Active rook move that could threaten White's position.\n\nLet me look at c7f4 more closely. If I play Bf4, I'm directly attacking White's rook on f3. White would likely move the rook, giving me time to improve my position further. This seems very promising.\n\nLet me check for any immediate threats from White. The bishop on g7 is pinning my king to the rook on e8, but there's no immediate checkmate threat. Moving my king to h7 would actually walk into potential discovered checks, so I should avoid that.\n\nThe move c7f4 stands out as the most active and threatening option. It attacks White's rook directly, gains tempo, and improves my piece activity.\n\n```\nc7f4\n```"
