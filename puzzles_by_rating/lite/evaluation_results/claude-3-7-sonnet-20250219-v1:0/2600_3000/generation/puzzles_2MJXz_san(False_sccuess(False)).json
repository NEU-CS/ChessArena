When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position step by step to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: I count White has a rook, bishop, knight, queen, and 5 pawns. Black has a rook, 2 bishops, knight, queen, and 7 pawns. So Black is up a minor piece.\n- King safety: White's king is on g3, somewhat exposed. Black's king is on c8, castled queenside.\n- Piece activity: White has a bishop on h8 that's attacking the g7 square, a queen on g5, and a knight on h4. Black has bishops on e4 and e3, and a knight on c2 that's attacking White's position.\n\nKey tactical opportunities:\n1. The bishop on h8 is attacking the g7 square, which could be a potential fork point.\n2. White's queen on g5 has several aggressive options.\n3. Black's knight on c2 is deep in White's territory and threatening pieces.\n4. Black's bishop on e3 is attacking White's king position.\n\nLet me examine the most promising moves:\n\n1. **g5g8**: Queen to g8 checks the Black king, but after Kd7, there's no immediate follow-up.\n\n2. **h8g7**: Bishop to g7 attacks the h6 square but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n3. **g5d8**: Queen to d8 is checkmate! The Black king on c8 has no escape squares as the queen delivers check and all escape squares are covered.\n\nThis is a decisive move that ends the game immediately. No need to consider other options when checkmate is available.\n\n```\ng5d8\n```"
