When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, let me understand the material situation:\n- White has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and several pawns\n- Black has a queen, a rook, two bishops, and several pawns\n\nKey observations:\n1. White's queen on h7 is threatening my king on f8\n2. White's bishop on h6 is also aimed at my king\n3. My rook on f5 is active but potentially under threat\n4. The pawn structure is complex with pawns on both sides\n\nLet me evaluate the immediate threats:\n- White's queen on h7 is threatening checkmate on f7\n- If I don't address this immediately, I could lose the game\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. `f8e8` - Moving the king away from the threat\n2. `e7f7` - Blocking the check with the queen\n3. `f5f7` - Blocking with the rook\n\nLooking at `f8e8`: This moves my king away from the immediate threat, but White could still pursue with Qf7+ followed by Qf8#.\n\nLooking at `e7f7`: This blocks the check but exposes my queen to capture by White's queen.\n\nLooking at `f5f7`: This blocks the check with my rook, but then White can capture with Qxf7+ and I'd be forced to move my king, allowing White to continue the attack.\n\nI need to find a move that not only addresses the immediate threat but also improves my position.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the best move is to move my king to e8, getting out of the immediate check threat while maintaining my material.\n\n```\nf8e8\n```"
