When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material: Equal (each side has a king, bishop, and pawn)\n2. Pawn advancement: White's pawn on g7 is very advanced and close to promotion\n3. King position: White's king is active and close to Black's king\n\nThe most critical aspect here is White's g7 pawn, which is one move away from promotion. If I can safely promote this pawn, I should win the game.\n\nLet's analyze the legal moves:\n- Bishop moves (g6e8, g6h7, g6f7, g6h5, g6f5, g6e4, g6d3, g6c2, g6b1): I need to check if any of these protect my pawn's promotion path\n- King moves (f6g5, f6f5): I need to see if these help control the promotion square\n\nThe move g6e8 captures Black's bishop, eliminating a defender and clearing the way for my pawn promotion. After g6e8, I can promote my pawn on the next move with g7g8Q, and Black won't be able to stop it.\n\nThe move g6h7 also controls the g8 square, but doesn't capture the bishop, so Black could potentially capture my bishop.\n\nLet me check if there are any immediate threats from Black that I need to address first. Black's h3 pawn is far from promotion, and the bishop on g8 doesn't threaten any of my pieces directly.\n\nGiven this analysis, capturing the bishop with g6e8 is clearly the strongest move, as it removes the defender of the g8 square and ensures my pawn can promote safely.\n\n```\ng6e8\n```"
