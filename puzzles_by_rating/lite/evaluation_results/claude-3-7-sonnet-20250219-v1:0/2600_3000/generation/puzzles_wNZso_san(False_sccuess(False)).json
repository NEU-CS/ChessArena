When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a rook, bishop, and 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king on f7 is somewhat exposed, White's king on f3 is active.\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have isolated pawns. White has an advanced b6 pawn that could be dangerous.\n- Piece activity: White's rook on c5 is active, and the bishop on f4 controls important diagonals.\n\nLet me consider the candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves (d6e8, d6c8, d6f5, d6e4, d6c4)**:\n   - d6f5 looks interesting as it attacks White's bishop\n   - d6e4 would fork White's king and c3 pawn\n   - d6c4 would attack the c3 pawn\n\n2. **Rook moves (d7d8, d7e7, d7c7)**:\n   - None seem particularly strong\n\n3. **King moves (f7g8, f7f8, f7e8, f7e7, f7e6)**:\n   - The king is somewhat exposed, so improving its position could be good\n\n4. **Pawn moves (g7g6, f6f5, b5b4, g7g5)**:\n   - b5b4 could undermine White's c3 pawn\n   - f6f5 would challenge White's control of the center\n\nLooking at the knight moves more carefully:\n- Nd6-e4+ is a check and forks the king and c3 pawn. This looks very strong.\n- Nd6-f5 attacks the bishop but doesn't win material immediately.\n\nThe move Nd6-e4+ stands out as it gives check and attacks the c3 pawn simultaneously. After Kf3-e3 (forced), Black can capture the c3 pawn with Ne4xc3, winning a pawn.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd6e4\n```"
