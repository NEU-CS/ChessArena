When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a bishop and 3 pawns, with one pawn on d7 about to promote.\n- King positions: Black king on d6, White king on e4.\n- Critical threats: White's d7 pawn is one move away from promotion.\n- Black's advantages: Active rook on b6, connected passed pawns on e5 and f4.\n\nLet me evaluate the most critical aspects:\n\n1. Stopping White's d7 pawn promotion is the highest priority. Options:\n   - d8e7 (Bishop takes the promotion square)\n   - d6e7 (King moves to the promotion square)\n\n2. Counterattack possibilities:\n   - Using the rook to attack White's pieces\n   - Advancing Black's own pawns\n\nLet's analyze the key candidate moves:\n\n1. d8e7: This blocks the pawn promotion but leaves the bishop potentially vulnerable.\n\n2. d6e7: This blocks the pawn promotion with the king, but might expose the king to checks.\n\n3. b6b8: Rook to the back rank, preparing to attack from behind after White promotes.\n\n4. f4f3+: This gives a check to White's king and advances a passed pawn.\n\n5. c4c3: Advances another passed pawn.\n\nLooking at d8e7 more closely: After Black plays Bd8-e7, White could capture with dxe7, promoting to a queen and creating a serious threat.\n\nLooking at d6e7: After Kd6-e7, White would capture dxe7 and the pawn promotes anyway.\n\nThe move f4f3+ gives check and advances a passed pawn, forcing the White king to respond, which might give Black time to address the promotion threat.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the best move is to give check with f4f3+, forcing the White king to move and buying time to deal with the promotion threat on the next move.\n\n```\nf4f3\n```"
