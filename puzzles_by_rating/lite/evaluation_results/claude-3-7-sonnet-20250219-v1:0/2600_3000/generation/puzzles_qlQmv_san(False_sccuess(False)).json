When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king (h6) is exposed while White's king (g2) is relatively safe.\n- Immediate threats: White's queen on f4 is threatening Black's king.\n\nLet me analyze each legal move:\n\n1. **h6h7**: Moving the king to h7\n   - This keeps the king on the h-file but moves it away from the white queen's immediate attack.\n   - However, White could play Qf7+ followed by Qxg7+ and the king would be in trouble.\n\n2. **h6g6**: Moving the king to g6\n   - This moves the king closer to the center but exposes it to potential checks.\n   - White could play Qf6+ forcing the king to move again.\n\n3. **h6h5**: Moving the king to h5\n   - This moves the king down the h-file.\n   - White could play Qf5+ followed by Qg5#, leading to checkmate.\n\n4. **g7g5**: Moving the pawn to g5\n   - This blocks the diagonal attack from White's queen.\n   - It creates a shield for the king and prevents immediate checks.\n   - This gives the king more breathing room and allows Black to potentially counter-attack with the queen.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, g7g5 is clearly the best move. It blocks the white queen's attack on the king and prevents immediate checks, giving Black time to use the queen for counterplay.\n\n```\ng7g5\n```"
