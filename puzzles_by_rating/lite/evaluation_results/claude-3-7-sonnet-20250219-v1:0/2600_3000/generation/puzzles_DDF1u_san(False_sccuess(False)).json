When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me examine `b3g8` and `b3f7`:\n\nWith `b3g8`, the queen threatens checkmate on g2, but White can block with Qf2.\n\nWith `b3f7`, the queen threatens checkmate on f1, and it's not clear how White can defend effectively. If White moves Qf2, Black can capture the queen.\n\nLet me check `b3f7` more carefully:\n- After Qb3-f7, Black threatens Qf1#\n- White's defenses are limited:\n  - If Qd4-f2, then Qf7xf2+ followed by Kxf2\n  - If Rd1-f1, then Qf7xf1+ followed by Kxf1\n\nThis looks like a winning move for Black.\n\n```\nb3f7\n```"
