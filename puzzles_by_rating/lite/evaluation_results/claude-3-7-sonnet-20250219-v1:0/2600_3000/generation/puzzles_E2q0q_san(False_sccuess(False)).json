When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the material and position:\n- Material: White has a rook, queen, two knights, and a bishop (plus pawns)\n- Black has a queen, rook, two bishops, and a knight (plus pawns)\n- Material is roughly equal, with Black having the bishop pair advantage\n\nKey observations:\n1. White's rook on a7 is attacking the 7th rank and threatening Black's position\n2. Black's queen on d8 and rook on f8 are not well coordinated\n3. White has a passed pawn on b5 that could be advanced\n4. Black's bishop on g4 is pinning White's knight on e2 to the queen on b3\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **a7a8**: Rook to the 8th rank could be powerful, but Black can respond with Qxa8\n2. **a7g7**: Attacking the h7 bishop and g6 pawn - this looks very threatening\n3. **d2h6**: Taking Black's knight would win material\n4. **h3g4**: Capturing Black's bishop would eliminate the pin on the e2 knight\n\nThe move **a7g7** looks particularly strong as it attacks Black's bishop on h7 and threatens the g6 pawn. If Black's bishop moves, White can capture the g6 pawn, weakening Black's king position.\n\nThe move **d2h6** directly captures a piece, winning material.\n\nLet me check if **h3g4** is viable - this would capture Black's bishop and remove the pin on the e2 knight. However, Black could recapture with the h6 knight.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe **a7g7** is the strongest move, creating immediate threats against Black's kingside and putting tremendous pressure on Black's position.\n\n```\na7g7\n```"
