If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, rook, bishop, and 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- White's rook on d8 is threatening Black's position.\n- Black's queen on b7 and rook on e7 are both under attack from White's rook.\n- Black's king on g7 seems relatively safe for now.\n- The e5 knight is a strong piece in the center.\n\nLet me evaluate the most critical aspects:\n1. White's rook on d8 is threatening to capture something - I need to address this immediate threat.\n2. My queen on b7 is under attack from the white rook.\n3. My rook on e7 is also under attack from the white rook.\n\nLooking at defensive options:\n- Moving the queen away (b7c8, b7b8, b7a8, b7d7, b7c7, b7b6, b7a6) would save the queen but leave the rook on e7 hanging.\n- Moving the rook (e7e8, e7f7, e7d7, e7c7, e7e6) would save the rook but leave the queen hanging.\n\nI need to find a move that addresses both threats simultaneously or creates a stronger counter-threat.\n\nThe move e7e8 looks promising as it attacks White's rook on d8, creating a direct counter-threat. If White captures my queen after e7e8, I can recapture their rook with my rook.\n\nLet me double-check if there are any better tactical opportunities:\n- e4e3 could be interesting to advance a passed pawn, but doesn't address the immediate threats.\n- The bishop moves don't seem to create immediate threats.\n- The knight is well-placed and moving it would be suboptimal.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe e7e8 is the best move as it creates a direct counter-threat against White's rook while protecting my queen indirectly through this threat.\n\n```\ne7e8\n```"
