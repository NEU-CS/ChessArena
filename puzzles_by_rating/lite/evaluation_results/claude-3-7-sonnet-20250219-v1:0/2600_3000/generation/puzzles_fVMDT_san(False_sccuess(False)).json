When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the material and positional factors first.\n\nMaterial count:\n- Black: Queen (0), Rooks (2), Bishops (1), Knights (0), Pawns (4)\n- White: Queen (0), Rooks (1), Bishops (0), Knights (1), Pawns (3)\n\nSo Black has a material advantage of a bishop for a knight, plus an extra pawn.\n\nPosition analysis:\n- White's king is exposed on c4\n- Black has two active rooks on f7 and g3\n- Black's bishop on h5 is targeting the long diagonal\n- White's rook on a6 and knight on e6 are active\n- White has a passed pawn on c6 which is dangerous\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **g3c3+**: This checks the white king and forces it to move. This looks very strong.\n2. **f7f5**: Attacking the knight on e6 indirectly.\n3. **g3g4**: Attacking the h4 pawn.\n4. **h5g4**: Moving the bishop to attack the h4 pawn.\n\nLet me analyze the most promising move g3c3+:\nIf Rc3+, White's king must move. If Kd4, then Rd7+ followed by Rxc6 wins material. If Kb4, then Rb3+ wins the b-pawn. If Kb5, then Rb3+ still wins the b-pawn.\n\nThis is clearly the best move as it creates an immediate tactical threat against the exposed white king.\n\n```\ng3c3\n```"
