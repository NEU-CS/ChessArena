When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

So Black is down a minor piece equivalent.\n- King safety: Black's king is on d6, White's on e3.\n- Pawn structure: Black has connected pawns on f5-g5 and an isolated h7 pawn.\n- Piece activity: Black has two rooks - one on c7 and one on d5.\n\nLet me evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. Rook moves (c7 rook):\n   - Moving the c7 rook doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n   - c7c6 blocks the king's retreat square.\n\n2. King moves:\n   - d6e7, d6e6, d6e5 all move the king toward the center, but don't create immediate advantages.\n\n3. d5 rook moves:\n   - d5d4 puts pressure on White's position.\n   - d5d3 is even stronger - it directly attacks White's rook on d3.\n\n4. Pawn moves:\n   - g5g4 and f5f4 advance the pawns but don't create immediate threats.\n   - h7h6 or h7h5 don't seem critical.\n\nThe move d5d3 stands out as it directly captures White's rook on d3. This would equalize material and give Black a significant advantage.\n\nLet's verify: If d5d3, White must recapture with Kxd3, and then Black has a much better position with material equality.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd5d3\n```"
