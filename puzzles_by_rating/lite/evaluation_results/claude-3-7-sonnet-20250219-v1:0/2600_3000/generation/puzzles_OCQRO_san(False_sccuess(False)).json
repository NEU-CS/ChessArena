When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material is roughly equal\n- White has a knight on g5 in an aggressive position\n- Black has a fianchettoed bishop on d6 and knight on f6 defending the kingside\n- Black's king is on g8 with some weakened pawn structure around it\n\nLooking at the position, I notice the knight on g5 is attacking the h7 square, which is only defended by the Black king. This suggests a potential tactical opportunity.\n\nLet me examine the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **g5h7 (Knight takes h7)**: This is a classic knight sacrifice attacking the Black king. After Nxh7, if Kxh7, then Qh5+ followed by Qxf7+ would win material and maintain an attack.\n\n2. **e2h5 (Queen to h5)**: This threatens mate on h7 and coordinates well with the knight on g5.\n\n3. **g5f7 (Knight takes f7)**: This would win a pawn but after Rxf7, White doesn't have an immediate follow-up.\n\n4. **e2e4 (Queen to e4)**: This would increase the queen's activity and pressure the center.\n\nThe most forcing line is the knight sacrifice on h7. Let's analyze it:\n- After g5h7, Black must play Kxh7\n- Then Qh5+ forces Kg8\n- Qxf7+ leads to Kh8\n- White can continue the attack with moves like Re3-Rh3\n\nThis tactical sequence gives White a winning advantage by capturing material and maintaining a strong attack against the exposed Black king.\n\n```\ng5h7\n```"
