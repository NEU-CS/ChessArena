When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, rook, bishop, and 5 pawns. Material is equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on f2, relatively exposed. Black's king is on h8, in the corner.\n- Piece activity: White's queen is on e6, very active and threatening Black's position.\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have some pawn weaknesses.\n\nLooking at the position, I notice that White's queen on e6 is attacking Black's rook on f8, and is also in a position to potentially deliver checkmate. Let me explore tactical opportunities.\n\nThe most immediate threat is capturing the rook on f8 with e6xf8+, but this isn't in the legal moves list because it would be immediately recaptured by the king.\n\nHowever, I see a potential checkmate pattern. If I play Qe6-g8+, Black's king must capture (Kxg8), and then I can follow up with Rg1-g8#.\n\nLet's verify this:\n1. e6g8+ (Queen to g8 check) - Black must play Kxg8\n2. g1g8# (Rook to g8 checkmate)\n\nThis is a forced checkmate in 2 moves. No need to consider other options when there's a clear checkmate available.\n\n```\ne6g8\n```"
