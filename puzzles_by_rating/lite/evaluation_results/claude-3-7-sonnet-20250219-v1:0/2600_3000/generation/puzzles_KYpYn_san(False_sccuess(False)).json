When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me check if it's threatening my king:\n- From d1, the queen controls the d-file, the diagonal to h5, and the diagonal to a4\n- My king at f3 is not directly under attack from the queen\n\nHowever, I should be cautious about potential checks. Let me see which move best protects my king:\n- f3e4: Could expose the king to checks along the e-file or diagonals\n- f3e3: Similar concerns as e4\n- f3g2: Moves away from the center but provides shelter\n- f3f2: Moves back but could be vulnerable along the f-file\n\nGiven that I have a material advantage and need to protect my king, the safest move appears to be f3g2, which moves my king away from potential threats while maintaining my advantage.\n\n```\nf3g2\n```"
