When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the current situation:\n\n1) Material count:\n   - White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawns\n   - Black has two rooks, a bishop, knight, queen, and pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, with Black having a slight advantage\n\n2) Key threats and opportunities:\n   - White's rook on e7 is threatening my position\n   - White's queen on f5 is also applying pressure\n   - My queen on a3 is active but potentially vulnerable\n   - My rook on c3 is attacking along the 3rd rank\n   - My knight on c2 is forking White's rook on a1 and potentially other pieces\n\n3) Critical tactical opportunities:\n   - The knight on c2 is forking White's rook on a1 and potentially threatening the king\n   - My rook on c3 could deliver a check or attack other pieces\n   - The queen on a3 could potentially deliver a decisive attack\n\nLooking at the knight fork on c2, this seems like a strong tactical opportunity. Let me check if Nc2xa1 captures the rook safely:\n- After Nc2xa1, White would likely recapture with Ra1xa1\n- But this would allow my rook to deliver a check with Rc3xf3, attacking the knight\n\nActually, I notice an even stronger tactic. My rook on c3 can capture the knight on f3 immediately:\n- After Rc3xf3, if White recaptures with g2xf3, then my queen can deliver a devastating check with Qa3xf3\n- This would likely lead to checkmate or significant material gain\n\nLet me verify this sequence:\n1. Rc3xf3 (capturing the knight)\n2. If g2xf3, then Qa3xf3 with a decisive attack\n3. If White doesn't capture, the knight is simply lost\n\nThis appears to be the strongest move in the position, creating an immediate tactical threat that White cannot adequately defend against.\n\n```\nc3f3\n```"
