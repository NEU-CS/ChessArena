Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is in the corner, White's king is on f7, quite advanced.\n- Pawn structure: Black has connected passed pawns on c3 and d3, which are very dangerous.\n- White's h6 pawn is close to promotion.\n\nKey factors:\n1. Black's passed pawns on c3 and d3 are a major asset and close to queening\n2. The rook on d2 is currently undefended\n3. White's rook on h1 and bishop on f3 are active pieces\n\nLet me evaluate the candidate moves:\n- Moving the king (h8h7) seems passive when we have winning chances\n- Knight moves don't immediately improve our position\n- Advancing pawns (c3c2) looks very strong as it threatens promotion\n- Rook moves need careful consideration - we could threaten White's pieces or support our pawns\n\nThe move c3c2 stands out as particularly strong because:\n- It advances our passed pawn to the 2nd rank\n- It threatens immediate promotion\n- White will be forced to deal with this threat immediately\n\nThis move creates an immediate winning threat. White would need to sacrifice material to stop both c2 and d3 from promoting.\n\n```\nc3c2\n```"

This is clearly the most forcing and powerful option available. When a pawn can promote, it's usually the highest priority move to consider.\n\nLooking at the promotion options:\n- c2c1q (promoting to queen) would give Black a massive material advantage\n- c2c1r (promoting to rook) would be less powerful\n- c2c1b or c2c1n (promoting to bishop or knight) would be even weaker\n\nWhite's rook on g1 is currently defending the c1 square, but after promotion, Black would have a queen vs. rook exchange which would be highly favorable.\n\nThe other moves don't offer nearly as much immediate value as promoting the pawn. Moving the king, knight, or other pawns would allow White to capture the c2 pawn with the rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is clearly to promote the c2 pawn to a queen:\n\n```\nc2c1q\n```"
