When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The position is quite simplified with only kings and pawns\n2. Black's king is more active, positioned on f6\n3. White's e4 pawn is advanced and could be a threat to promote\n4. There's a potential pawn race situation\n\nLet's analyze each legal move:\n\n**King moves (g2h2, g2h1, g2g1, g2f1)**:\n- Moving the king away from the center is generally not good in endgames\n- None of these moves make progress toward winning\n- g2f1 might be slightly better as it moves toward the center, but doesn't change much\n\n**Pawn moves:**\n- f4f5: This creates a passed pawn and restricts Black's king. It could be a strong move.\n- h3h4: Doesn't accomplish much strategically\n- g3g4: Secures more space but doesn't create immediate threats\n- f2f3: Supports the e4 pawn but doesn't create new threats\n\nThe most promising move is f4f5+. This advance:\n1. Creates a passed pawn that could promote\n2. Restricts Black's king movement\n3. Controls more space\n4. Forces Black to make a decision about how to respond\n\nAfter f4f5+, if Black's king moves to e5, White can defend with the king. If Black's king moves to g5, White can play g3g4 to restrict it further.\n\n```\nf4f5\n```"
