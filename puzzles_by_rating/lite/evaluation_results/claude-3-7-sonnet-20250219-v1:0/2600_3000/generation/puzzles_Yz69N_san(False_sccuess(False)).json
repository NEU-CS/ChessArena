When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has two rooks, a knight, a queen, and several pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe. Black's king is also reasonably protected.\n- Threats: Black has a rook on b3 and a queen on b4 that are threatening White's position. Black's knight on c3 is also active.\n\nLet me examine the immediate threats:\n1. Black's rook on b3 threatens White's second rank\n2. Black's queen on b4 is attacking White's c4 pawn\n3. Black's knight on c3 is attacking White's e2 square\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities:\n- The most striking opportunity is that White's queen on c6 can capture on e8, delivering checkmate: Qxe8#\n- This works because the Black king on g8 has no escape squares, and the rook on f8 is pinned to the king by the queen.\n\nLet me verify this:\n- Black's king is on g8\n- Black's rook is on f8\n- If White plays Qc6xe8, the Black king cannot capture because the queen would be protected\n- The Black king has no escape squares (g7 and h7 are blocked by pawns, h8 is covered by White's queen)\n\nThis is a clear checkmate in one move.\n\n```\nc6e8\n```"
