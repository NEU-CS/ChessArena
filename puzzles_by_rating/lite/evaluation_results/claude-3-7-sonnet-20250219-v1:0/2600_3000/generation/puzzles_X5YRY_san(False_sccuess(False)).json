When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

(Actually, this shouldn't be in the legal moves list)\n\n2. **e2f2**: Moving the king to f2 would place it on a diagonal with Black's queen on g4, putting it in check. This is also illegal. (Shouldn't be in legal moves)\n\n3. **e2d2**: Moving the king to d2 gets it away from the diagonal of Black's queen, but leaves it exposed.\n\n4. **e2f1**: Moving the king to f1 also escapes the diagonal of Black's queen.\n\n5. **e2e1**: Moving the king to e1 keeps it on the same file but moves it away from the queen's diagonal.\n\n6. **g5f3**: Moving the knight from g5 to f3 could potentially threaten Black's queen on g4.\n\nLooking more deeply at g5f3:\n- This knight move would attack Black's queen on g4\n- Black would need to move the queen, giving White a tempo\n- This is the only move that creates an immediate threat\n\nThe king moves (d2, f1, e1) are all defensive and don't improve White's position significantly.\n\nThe move g5f3 is clearly the best as it:\n1. Attacks Black's queen\n2. Gains a tempo\n3. Improves the knight's position\n4. Takes initiative rather than just defending\n\n```\ng5f3\n```"
