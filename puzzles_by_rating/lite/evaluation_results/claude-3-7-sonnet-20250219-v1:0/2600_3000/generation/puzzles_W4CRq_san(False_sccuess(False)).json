When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This is a check situation that I must address immediately.\n\nLet's examine each legal move:\n\n1. f1e2: Moving my king away from the check. This is a defensive move that addresses the immediate threat.\n\n2. h5d1: Moving my queen to d1 to block the check. This interposes my queen between the rook and my king.\n\n3. g5c1: Capturing the rook with my bishop, eliminating the threat completely.\n\nAnalyzing these options:\n- f1e2 simply moves the king away but doesn't gain material\n- h5d1 blocks the check but puts my queen in a potentially vulnerable position\n- g5c1 captures the threatening rook, gaining material and removing the threat\n\nThe g5c1 move is clearly the best as it captures a rook (worth 5 points) while addressing the check. This is a material gain and solves the immediate threat in one move.\n\n```\ng5c1\n```"
