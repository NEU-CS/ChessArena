When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position step by step to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the material and position:\n- Material: White has a rook, bishop, queen, and 4 pawns. Black has a rook, bishop, knight, queen, and 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is exposed, Black's king is in the corner.\n- Piece activity: White has active pieces, especially the rook on f4 and bishop on e6.\n- Threats: Black's queen on c4 and rook on a2 are threatening pieces.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Black's king is in the corner with limited escape squares.\n2. White's bishop on e6 is attacking g8, a key square next to Black's king.\n3. White's rook on f4 can potentially deliver mate with support.\n\nLet me check for immediate tactical opportunities:\n- The move e6g8 (bishop captures g8) looks very strong as it attacks the h7 square next to the king.\n- After e6g8, if Black recaptures with Kxg8, then Qf5 threatens mate on g6.\n\nLet's verify this line:\n1. e6g8 (Bishop takes g8) - Black must recapture with Kxg8\n2. After Kxg8, White has Qf5 threatening Qg6#\n3. Black has limited defenses against this threat\n\nThis looks like a winning combination. Let's double-check if there are any other strong moves:\n- f4f8+ looks tempting but after Kh7, there's no immediate follow-up.\n- c2f5 (Queen to f5) is strong but doesn't have the same immediate impact as e6g8.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the move e6g8 (Bishop captures on g8) creates the most powerful threat and leads to a winning position. Black will be forced to recapture, after which White can launch a decisive attack with the queen.\n\n```\ne6g8\n```"
