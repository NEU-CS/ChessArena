When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook, knight, and 3 pawns. Black has 2 rooks, a bishop, and 3 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on g3, potentially vulnerable with Black's rook on h4. Black's king is on g5.\n- Threats: Black's rook on d2 is threatening White's knight on e3. Black's rook on h4 is putting pressure on White's position.\n- Black has a dangerous passed h-pawn that could promote soon.\n\nLet me examine the most critical aspects:\n1. The h2 pawn is one move away from promotion\n2. Black's rooks are actively placed and threatening\n3. White needs to either defend against threats or create counterplay\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- Taking the h2 pawn with h1h2 would prevent immediate promotion\n- Knight moves like e3g4 could fork Black's king and rook\n- Rook moves like d7d8 could prepare for back rank threats\n\nThe most urgent threat is the h2 pawn about to promote, so h1h2 seems critical. However, I should check if there are any winning tactical opportunities first.\n\nThe knight on e3 could move to g4, which would fork Black's king on g5 and rook on h4. This would be a powerful tactic.\n\nLet me verify e3g4:\n- It attacks Black's king on g5\n- It attacks Black's rook on h4\n- Black can't capture the knight with the king as it would be moving into check from the rook on h1\n- If Black moves the king, White captures the rook on h4\n- If Black moves the rook, White can capture the h2 pawn next\n\nThis knight fork is decisive and should win material, solving our problems with the h2 pawn afterward.\n\n```\ne3g4\n```"
