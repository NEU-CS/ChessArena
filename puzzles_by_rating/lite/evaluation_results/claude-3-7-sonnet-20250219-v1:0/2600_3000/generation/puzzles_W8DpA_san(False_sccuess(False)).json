When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a bishop and 5 pawns. Material is equal.\n- King positions: White's king is on f1, Black's king is on d4 in the center.\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have some advanced pawns. Black's e3 pawn is quite advanced.\n\nLet's examine each legal move:\n\n1. Bishop moves (c2h7, c2g6, c2f5, c2e4, c2d3, c2d1, c2b1):\n   - c2h7: Moves the bishop to the edge, not controlling important squares.\n   - c2g6: Attacks h5 but not particularly strong.\n   - c2f5: Diagonal control but no immediate threats.\n   - c2e4: Would capture Black's advanced e-pawn, which is a significant threat.\n   - c2d3: Blocks the Black king but doesn't create immediate threats.\n   - c2d1/c2b1: Retreating without purpose.\n\n2. King moves (f1g2, f1e2):\n   - f1g2: Moves toward the kingside.\n   - f1e2: Moves toward the center and could potentially help against Black's e-pawn.\n\n3. Pawn moves (g4g5, h2h3, h2h4):\n   - g4g5: Creates space on the kingside.\n   - h2h3/h2h4: Advances the h-pawn without clear purpose.\n\nThe critical factor here is Black's advanced e3 pawn, which is a significant threat to promote. Taking it with c2e4 would eliminate this threat while maintaining our bishop's activity.\n\nLet's check for any tactical issues with c2e4:\n- After c2e4, Black's king can't immediately capture our bishop because it would be on e4.\n- Black's bishop on f2 doesn't directly threaten our bishop if we move to e4.\n\nThe move c2e4 stands out as clearly the best as it:\n1. Captures a dangerous advanced pawn\n2. Places our bishop actively in the center\n3. Controls important squares\n4. Maintains material equality\n\n```\nc2e4\n```"
