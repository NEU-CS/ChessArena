When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is relatively safe, while White's king on f1 is somewhat exposed.\n- Pawn structure: Black has several advanced pawns on the kingside.\n- Special features: Black has an e-pawn on e3 that's quite advanced and threatening.\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities:\n1. The rook on d2 is attacking the e2 pawn and is undefended by White.\n2. Black's queen on g3 is attacking the h2 rook and creating mating threats.\n3. The bishop on f2 is controlling important diagonals and pinning White's e-pawn.\n\nLet me check for immediate threats:\n- The most powerful immediate threat seems to be Qg3-f3+ followed by mate.\n- The move Qg3-f3+ would force the White king to move, after which Rd2-d1# would be checkmate.\n\nLet's verify this sequence:\n1. Qg3-f3+ - White's king must move to e1 or g1\n2. If Kf1-e1, then Rd2-d1#\n3. If Kf1-g1, then Rd2-d1#\n\nThis is a forced checkmate in 2 moves. The best move is clearly:\n\n```\ng3f3\n```"
