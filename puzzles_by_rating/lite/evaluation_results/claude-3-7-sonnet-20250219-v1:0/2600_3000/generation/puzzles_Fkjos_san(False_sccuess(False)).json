If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a clear material advantage with the bishop. The goal should be to either checkmate Black's king or promote one of Black's pawns to secure a win.\n\nLet's analyze some candidate moves:\n\n1. Bishop moves:\n   - The bishop on c6 can control important diagonals\n   - Moving to f3 would put pressure on Black's king\n   - Moving to e4 would block the Black king's movement\n\n2. King moves:\n   - Moving to f5 would attack the e5 pawn\n   - Moving to f6 would help control the e5 pawn's promotion square\n\nLooking at the position more deeply, I notice that if I can capture the e5 pawn safely, I can prevent Black from promoting it. The bishop can't capture it directly, but the king can approach it.\n\nThe move g5f5 allows White's king to attack the e5 pawn directly. Black's king is too far away (on e3) to defend it immediately. After capturing this pawn, White would have a winning position as Black would only have the a5 pawn left, which White can stop with the bishop.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5f5\n```\n\nThis move attacks the e5 pawn directly and will likely lead to its capture on the next move, giving White a decisive advantage."
