When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King activity is crucial in endgames\n2. Pawn structure and potential passed pawns\n3. Preventing Black's king from penetrating further\n\nLet me analyze the candidate moves:\n\nKing moves:\n- Moving the king to d3/d2/b2 keeps control of important squares\n- Moving to c1/b1/d1 seems passive and doesn't improve the position\n\nPawn moves:\n- f4g5 captures a pawn but allows hxg5, creating a passed h-pawn for Black\n- f4f5 creates a passed pawn but might be vulnerable\n- e4e5 challenges Black's pawn structure\n- h3h4 fixes the g5 pawn and prevents g4\n- g3g4 attacks h5 but might weaken the pawn structure\n\nThe most promising moves appear to be king moves to improve position or strategic pawn advances.\n\nI think the best move is to advance the king to d3, which:\n1. Centralizes the king\n2. Supports the e4 pawn\n3. Prepares to potentially push the e-pawn\n4. Maintains flexibility\n\n```\nc2d3\n```"
