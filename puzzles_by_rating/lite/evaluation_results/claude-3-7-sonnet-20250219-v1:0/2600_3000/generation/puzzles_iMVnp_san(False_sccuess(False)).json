When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The white bishop on g5 is threatening my f7 pawn\n2. My knights on c6 and d6 could potentially be developed to better squares\n3. I should consider king safety and potential counterplay\n\nLet me analyze some candidate moves:\n\n1. **f7f6**: This would defend the f7 pawn from the bishop's attack, but weakens my king position and allows Bxf6.\n\n2. **Knight moves**: \n   - Nd6e4 looks interesting as it attacks the center and could threaten White's position\n   - Nd6f5 develops the knight to an active square\n\n3. **Rook moves**:\n   - Connecting my rooks with Rf8g8 or similar could be useful\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe Nd6f5 is the strongest move. This knight move:\n- Develops my knight to an active central square\n- Threatens to fork White's pieces if it advances further\n- Indirectly protects the f7 pawn by creating counterplay\n\n```\nd6f5\n```"
