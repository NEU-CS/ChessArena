When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If White captures with fxg2, Black has Ra3e3+ winning the queen.\n\n2. **g2e2**: This directly attacks White's rook on d2, but White can simply move the rook.\n\n3. **a3e3**: This checks White's king, but after the king moves, there's no immediate follow-up.\n\n4. **g2h3**: This threatens White's h2 pawn but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\nLooking more deeply at g2f3:\n- If White plays Kd3, Black has Qxf3+ followed by Qxd1\n- If White plays Ke5, Black has Qxd5+ winning the queen\n- If White plays Kf4, Black has Ra4+ followed by Qxd4\n\nThis move creates multiple threats that White cannot address simultaneously. The queen attacks both the f3 pawn and creates a discovered attack from the rook on a3 against the king.\n\n```\ng2f3\n```"
