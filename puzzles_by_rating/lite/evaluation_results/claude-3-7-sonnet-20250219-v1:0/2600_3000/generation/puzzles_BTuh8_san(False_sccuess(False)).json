When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I only have two legal moves to get out of check.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n**Option 1: f2g3**\nIf I move my king to g3, I escape the immediate check. However, Black's bishop on g4 would then be able to capture my king with g4-f3 on the next move, which would be checkmate. This is clearly losing.\n\n**Option 2: f2g1**\nIf I move my king to g1, I escape the immediate check and move away from the diagonal controlled by Black's bishop on g4. This keeps me in the game.\n\nAfter f2g1, Black might play Qe1+ to continue checking, but I can respond with Kf2 and we'd have a repetition. Alternatively, Black might try something else, but at least I'm not immediately losing.\n\nThe choice is clear - I must play f2g1 to avoid immediate checkmate.\n\n```\nf2g1\n```"
