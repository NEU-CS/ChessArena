When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is in the corner with limited protection. White's king is on h2.\n- Threats: White's queen on g6 and bishop on f7 are creating pressure.\n\nLet me check for immediate threats or tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Checkmate threats:\n   - I don't see an immediate checkmate for either side.\n\n2. Tactical opportunities:\n   - The knight on e3 is attacking White's rook on f2, which is protecting the king.\n   - Black's rook on a1 is undefended but threatening the back rank.\n\n3. Key tactical idea: Black's rook on a1 can deliver a back-rank checkmate with Ra8#!\n\nThis is a decisive move since White has no way to prevent it. The white king is trapped on h2 with the g2 rook blocking its escape, and there's no way to interpose any piece between the rook and king.\n\n```\na1a8\n```"
