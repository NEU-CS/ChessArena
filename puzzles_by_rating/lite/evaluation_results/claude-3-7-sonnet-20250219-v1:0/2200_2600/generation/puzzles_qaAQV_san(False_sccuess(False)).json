When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook (on d2) and bishop (on f2) while I only have a knight on e6 as my main piece besides pawns and rooks.\n- Black's rook on d2 and bishop on f2 are both attacking my position.\n- My knight on e6 is active but not immediately threatening anything critical.\n- Black's king is on g8 with some pawn protection.\n- I have very limited legal moves: only g1h1 or g1f1 (king moves).\n\nLet me evaluate each legal move:\n\n**Option 1: g1h1**\nThis moves my king to the corner. The king would be slightly more protected in the corner, but otherwise doesn't change much about the position.\n\n**Option 2: g1f1**\nThis moves my king toward the center. However, Black's bishop is on f2, which means my king would be moving closer to the enemy bishop. This could potentially expose my king to more threats.\n\nGiven the limited options and the fact that I'm in a very difficult position (down material with Black having strong attacking pieces), I need to choose the move that gives me the best defensive chances.\n\nMoving to h1 (the corner) is slightly safer as it keeps my king away from Black's bishop on f2. Moving to f1 would place my king on the same file as Black's bishop, which could lead to tactical problems.\n\n```\ng1h1\n```"
