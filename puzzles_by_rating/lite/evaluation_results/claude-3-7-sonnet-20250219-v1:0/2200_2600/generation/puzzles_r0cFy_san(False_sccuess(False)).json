When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, bishop, and 5 pawns.\n- White is up material (queen vs. rook+bishop)\n- Black's king is exposed on h7\n- Black has a rook on e2 that's attacking White's position\n\nSince White has a material advantage, I should look for a decisive attack or checkmate opportunity.\n\nLooking at the position, I notice:\n1. White's queen on c7 and rook on d8 are well-positioned for an attack\n2. Black's king on h7 is vulnerable\n3. The h-file could be a pathway to attack\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Qg7+ looks like an immediate checkmate! The queen would attack the king, and Black has no legal moves.\n2. Rh8# would be checkmate if the king couldn't escape to g6, but it can.\n3. Qc8-h8 would be checkmate if Black's rook wasn't on h6.\n\nLet me verify Qg7+:\n- Black's king on h7 has no escape squares\n- The queen on g7 would be protected by our rook on d8\n- Black has no pieces that can capture the queen or block the check\n\nThis is a clear checkmate in one move with Qc7-g7+.\n\n```\nc7g7\n```"
