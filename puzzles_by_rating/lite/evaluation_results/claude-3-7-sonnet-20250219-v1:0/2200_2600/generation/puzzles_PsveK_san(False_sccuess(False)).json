If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I'm playing as Black, and I need to determine the best move from the given legal moves.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material is equal (both sides have 3 pawns)\n- White's king is on f4, Black's king is on h6\n- Black has pawns on f5, g6, h4\n- White has pawns on f3, g3, h3\n- It's Black's turn to move\n\nLet me analyze each legal move:\n\n1. h6h7: Moving my king back to h7 seems passive. It doesn't improve my position and gives White more freedom.\n\n2. h6g7: Moving my king to g7 also seems passive and doesn't create any immediate threats.\n\n3. h6h5: Moving my king to h5 approaches White's king but could be dangerous as White's king might attack my f5 pawn.\n\n4. h4g3: This captures White's g3 pawn. This is interesting as it creates connected passed pawns. However, White can recapture with f3xg3, and then my king would be far from these pawns.\n\n5. g6g5+: This advances my g-pawn and gives check to White's king. It forces White's king to move away from my h4 pawn, potentially allowing me to advance it.\n\nLet me think about the consequences of h4g3:\nIf I play h4xg3, White will likely play f3xg3, and then I'll have a passed f-pawn but White's king is close enough to stop it. Meanwhile, White's connected g3-h3 pawns could be dangerous.\n\nLet me think about g6g5+:\nThis forces White's king to move (likely to e4 or e5). Then I could potentially advance my h4 pawn. This seems to create more winning chances.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the most active and promising move is:\n\n```\ng6g5\n```\n\nThis check forces White's king to retreat, giving me time to potentially advance my h-pawn and create a passed pawn, which could be decisive in this endgame."
