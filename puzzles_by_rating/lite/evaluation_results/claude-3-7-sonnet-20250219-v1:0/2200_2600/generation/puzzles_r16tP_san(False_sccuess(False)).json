When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook, bishop, knight, queen, and pawns. Black has a rook, queen, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- White has a rook on b7 that's deeply penetrated into Black's position\n- White's bishop on g5 is actively placed\n- Black's king is on g8 with some pawn shelter\n- White's king is on h1, relatively safe\n\nKey tactical opportunities:\n1. The rook on b7 is attacking the a7 pawn and threatening the back rank\n2. The bishop on g5 is eyeing Black's kingside\n3. White has pressure on the b-file with both rooks\n\nLet me consider the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **b7b8**: Trading the rook for Black's rook. This seems reasonable but doesn't fully capitalize on White's initiative.\n\n2. **g5f6**: Bishop attacks the d8 square and threatens to win material. If Black captures with ...e7xf6, White can play Qd6 with a strong attack.\n\n3. **b7a7**: Capturing the a7 pawn. This wins material but needs calculation to ensure it's safe.\n\n4. **d3d6**: Queen penetration that threatens multiple pieces.\n\n5. **b1b8**: Double rook pressure on the 8th rank.\n\nLet me analyze the most promising lines:\n\nFor **g5f6**:\n- If Black plays ...exf6, White has Qd6 attacking c6 and threatening mate on g6\n- If Black plays ...gxf6, White has Qg6+ followed by Qxh7#\n\nFor **d3d6**:\n- This threatens the e7 knight and puts pressure on the c6 pawn\n- Creates immediate threats against Black's position\n\nAfter careful analysis, the bishop move to f6 creates the most dangerous threats and gives White a decisive advantage by attacking Black's king position.\n\n```\ng5f6\n```"
