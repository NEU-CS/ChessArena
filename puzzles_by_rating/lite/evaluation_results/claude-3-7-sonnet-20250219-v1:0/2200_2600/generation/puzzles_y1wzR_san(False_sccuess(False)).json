When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen on c8, a rook on e6, and king on f4.\n\n2) King safety: My king on e2 is relatively safe for now. White's king on f4 is exposed.\n\n3) Threats: White's rook on e6 threatens my g6 pawn. White's queen on c8 controls the c-file.\n\n4) Opportunities: I have my queen on a1 with many possible moves. My rook on a4 is active.\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. Checkmate opportunities: I should check if I can deliver checkmate.\n   - With my queen on a1, I can check if a1-f6 delivers checkmate. This would attack the king with no escape squares.\n   - Looking at the position, if I play Qa1-f6+, the White king can't move to e3, e4, e5, g3, g4, g5 (all controlled by my queen), and can't move to f3 or f5 (controlled by my pawn on e4). This is checkmate!\n\n2. Other options:\n   - Moving my king would be defensive and lose the initiative\n   - Moving my rook doesn't create immediate threats\n   - Moving my pawns doesn't improve my position significantly\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that Qa1-f6 delivers an immediate checkmate, ending the game.\n\n```\na1f6\n```"
