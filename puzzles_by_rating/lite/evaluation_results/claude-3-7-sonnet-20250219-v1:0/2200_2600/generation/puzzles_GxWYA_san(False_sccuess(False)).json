When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the material and position:\n- Material: Black has a rook, bishop, and 5 pawns. White has a rook, bishop, rook, and 3 pawns. So material is roughly equal (Black has 2 extra pawns but White has an extra rook).\n- Position: Black's king is exposed on b5, and White has two rooks that could potentially deliver checks.\n- Threats: White's rook on h7 is threatening to capture the b7 pawn. White's rook on c3 controls the c-file.\n\nLet me check for immediate threats or tactical opportunities:\n1. White's rook on h7 threatens the b7 pawn.\n2. Black's bishop on c4 is attacking White's king on f3.\n3. Black's rook on g6 is undefended.\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- The bishop move c4g8 doesn't create any immediate threats.\n- The king move b5c6 would move away from the dangerous b-file but might expose to other threats.\n- The rook move g6g3+ would check the White king, forcing it to move.\n\nThe move g6g3+ looks very strong as it checks the king and attacks the rook on c3. After White's king moves (likely to e4 or e2), Black can capture the rook on c3, gaining material advantage.\n\nLet me verify this is the best option by checking other possibilities:\n- Moving the d8 rook doesn't create immediate threats.\n- Moving the king doesn't improve the position significantly.\n- Advancing pawns doesn't address immediate threats.\n\nThe move g6g3+ is clearly the strongest, checking the king and threatening to win material.\n\n```\ng6g3\n```"
