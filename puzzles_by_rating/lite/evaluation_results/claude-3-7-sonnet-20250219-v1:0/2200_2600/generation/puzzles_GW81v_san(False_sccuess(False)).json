When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, let me understand the position:\n- I'm playing as Black\n- My king is on e8 with limited mobility (only 4 legal moves)\n- White has a knight on d6 and another on e2\n- White's queen is on f3, creating pressure\n- I have a knight on e5 and a queen on h6\n- White has a bishop on d4 and pawns on c4 and a2, b2, c2, f2, h2\n- My pawns are on a7, b7, f7, g7, h7\n\nThe legal moves are only king moves: e8f8, e8d8, e8e7, e8d7\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. e8f8: Moving king to f8\n   - This keeps my king on the back rank\n   - Moves away from the center\n   - Might allow castle-like protection with the rook on h8\n\n2. e8d8: Moving king to d8\n   - Moves toward the queenside\n   - Could be in line with White's queen on f3 (diagonal threat)\n\n3. e8e7: Moving king to e7\n   - Advances the king\n   - Could be exposed to attacks from White's pieces\n   - Blocks my own pawn on e7\n\n4. e8d7: Moving king to d7\n   - Advances the king diagonally\n   - Could be exposed to attacks\n   - Might interfere with development\n\nLet me check for immediate threats:\n- White's queen on f3 is targeting my kingside\n- White's knight on d6 is forking my rook on a8 and bishop on c8\n- White's bishop on d4 controls important diagonals\n\nI need to choose the safest square for my king. Let me analyze potential attacks after each move:\n\nAfter e8f8:\n- My king is relatively safe\n- I maintain the option to develop my kingside\n\nAfter e8d8:\n- My king could be vulnerable to diagonal attacks\n\nAfter e8e7:\n- My king advances but could be exposed to attacks from White's pieces\n\nAfter e8d7:\n- My king could be vulnerable to attacks from White's pieces\n\nGiven the limited options and the current position, the safest move appears to be e8f8, which keeps my king on the back rank and potentially allows for kingside development.\n\n```\ne8f8\n```"
