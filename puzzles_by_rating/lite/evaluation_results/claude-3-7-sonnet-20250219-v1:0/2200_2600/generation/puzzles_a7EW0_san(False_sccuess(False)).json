When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

So Black is down a minor piece.\n- King safety: Black's king is on f8 with a rook on e8 and h8. White's king is on g1.\n- Piece activity: Black's queen is on b4, attacking White's bishop on c4. The bishop on f5 is active.\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have somewhat broken pawn structures.\n\nLet me check for immediate threats:\n- White's queen on f3 is targeting f7, but it's not an immediate threat.\n- White's knight on e4 is attacking f6 and g5, but these aren't critical squares.\n- White's bishop on c4 is under attack by Black's queen.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **b4c4**: Capturing White's bishop would gain material and improve Black's position.\n2. **b4e7**: Queen move that maintains pressure but doesn't win material.\n3. **e8e4**: Capturing White's knight would equalize material.\n4. **f5g4**: Taking White's pawn would win a pawn.\n\nLet's analyze the best options:\n\nFor **b4c4** (capturing the bishop):\n- This wins a bishop, improving Black's material situation.\n- After Qxc4, White has no immediate threats or tactics.\n- This is a clean material gain.\n\nFor **e8e4** (capturing the knight):\n- After Rxe4, White can play Qxf5+ followed by Rxe4, winning material back.\n- This would be a poor exchange for Black.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best move is clearly to capture the undefended bishop:\n\n```\nb4c4\n```"
