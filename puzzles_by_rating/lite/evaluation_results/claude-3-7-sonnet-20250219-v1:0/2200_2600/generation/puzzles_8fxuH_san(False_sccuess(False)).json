When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal, but the position is complex.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. The b5 pawn is advanced and potentially dangerous\n2. Black's bishop on b6 is controlling the b5 pawn's promotion square\n3. Black's king is centralized at e5\n4. Both sides have passed pawns\n\nLet me analyze the candidate moves:\n\n1. Knight moves:\n   - b3c5: Knight attacks Black's king and controls the d7 square, which could help the b-pawn promote\n   - b3a5: Knight attacks the bishop but moves away from supporting the b-pawn\n   - b3d4: Knight attacks the e-pawn but could be captured by the king\n   - b3d2, b3c1, b3a1: Retreat moves that don't seem to improve White's position\n\n2. King moves:\n   - d1d2: Approaches the d3 pawn but doesn't immediately threaten it\n   - d1e1: Moves toward the kingside\n   - d1c1: Moves away from the center\n\n3. Pawn move:\n   - g4g5: Advances the g-pawn but doesn't create immediate threats\n\nThe most promising move appears to be b3c5, as it:\n- Attacks the black king, forcing it to move\n- Controls the d7 square, which is on the path to promotion for the b-pawn\n- Creates a potential fork threat if the king moves away\n\nAfter b3c5, if Black's king moves away (say to f5 or d5), White might be able to capture the e4 pawn with the knight, gaining material.\n\n```\nb3c5\n```"
