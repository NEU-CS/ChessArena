When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a rook, queen, and pawns.\n- King safety: Black's king (c6) is somewhat exposed, while White's king (d2) is also in the center.\n- Piece activity: Black has active pieces with the queen on e5 and rook on e6.\n\nLet me evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. **c6c7**: King move up one square\n   - This doesn't improve the king's safety significantly\n   - Doesn't create any immediate threats\n\n2. **c6b6**: King move left one square\n   - Similar to c6c7, doesn't significantly improve position\n   - Might be slightly safer than c6c7\n\n3. **c6c5**: King move down one square\n   - Moves king closer to the center, but potentially more exposed\n\n4. **c6b5**: King move diagonally\n   - Similar considerations to other king moves\n\n5. **e7d5**: Knight move to d5\n   - This creates a fork threat on White's queen (f3) and rook (d4)\n   - Very strong tactical move that would win material\n\n6. **e5d5**: Queen captures rook on d5\n   - This wins a rook immediately\n   - Need to check if there are any tactical issues after Qxd4\n\n7. **e5e4**: Queen move forward\n   - Doesn't win material\n   - Doesn't create immediate threats\n\nAfter analyzing these moves, the two strongest candidates are e7d5 (knight fork) and e5d5 (queen captures rook).\n\nIf I play e5d5 (queen takes rook), White's queen on f3 could recapture. After Qxd5, Qxd5, I would have traded queens but be up a rook for a knight, which is advantageous.\n\nIf I play e7d5 (knight fork), White cannot save both the queen and rook. This would win even more material than just capturing the rook directly.\n\nTherefore, the knight fork with e7d5 is the strongest move as it creates a double attack that will win more material than any other option.\n\n```\ne7d5\n```"
