When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the current state of the board:\n\n1) Material count:\n   - Black has a knight and 6 pawns\n   - White has a bishop and 4 pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal (knight vs bishop plus one pawn)\n\n2) Key positional elements:\n   - White has an advanced e6 pawn that's restricting Black's king\n   - Black has a knight on c4 that seems active\n   - Black has a passed f4 pawn that could be valuable\n   - White's bishop on g4 is controlling important diagonals\n\n3) Analyzing candidate moves:\n\nFirst, let's consider knight moves:\n- The knight on c4 is well-positioned and has many options\n- c4e5 would attack the e6 pawn directly\n- c4e3 could threaten White's position\n- c4d2 could fork White's king and pawns\n\nPawn moves:\n- f4f3+ would give check and advance the passed pawn\n- Capturing the e6 pawn with f7e6 would free up Black's position\n\nKing moves:\n- Moving the king doesn't seem urgent as there's no immediate threat\n\nAfter careful consideration, I see that f4f3+ gives an immediate check and advances my passed pawn. This move puts pressure on White's king and continues the advancement of my strongest asset - the passed f-pawn.\n\n```\nf4f3\n```"
