When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This abandons the opposition and gives Black's king more space.\n\n2. **d3e2**: Moving the king diagonally back. This loses the opposition and allows Black's king to advance.\n\n3. **d3d2**: Moving the king back. This gives up the opposition and allows Black's king to advance to d4.\n\n4. **d3c2**: Moving the king diagonally back. This loses the opposition and gives Black's king more freedom.\n\n5. **e3e4**: Advancing the e-pawn. This creates a passed pawn and challenges Black's pawn structure.\n\nThe key insight here is that in king and pawn endgames, maintaining opposition is crucial, but sometimes creating a passed pawn can be decisive.\n\nIf I play e3e4, it creates a passed pawn that could potentially queen. After e3e4, if Black captures with fxe4, my d4 pawn can capture back, creating a passed d-pawn. If Black doesn't capture, I have a passed e-pawn.\n\nThis move changes the pawn structure in my favor and creates winning chances, while the king moves all seem to lose the opposition and give Black an advantage.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne3e4\n```"
