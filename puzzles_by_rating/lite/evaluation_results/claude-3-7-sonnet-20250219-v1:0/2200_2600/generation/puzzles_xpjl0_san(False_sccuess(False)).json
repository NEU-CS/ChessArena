When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King activity is crucial\n2. Creating passed pawns could be decisive\n3. Need to prevent Black's king from penetrating my position\n\nLet me evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. c4b4: Moving my king to b4 doesn't make immediate progress and might allow Black's king to advance.\n\n2. c4d3: Moving toward Black's king and the center seems logical, as it maintains control and prepares to contest central squares.\n\n3. c4c3: Retreating my king loses tempo and gives Black's king more freedom.\n\n4. b3b4: Creating a passed pawn could be strong, but I need to calculate if it's safe.\n\n5. c2c3: Advancing this pawn doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n6. a2a3/a2a4: These moves don't significantly improve my position.\n\nThe most promising moves are c4d3 and b3b4. Let me analyze these deeper:\n\nc4d3 improves my king position, heading toward the center to oppose Black's king.\n\nb3b4 creates a potential passed pawn, but after b3b4, Black could play Kd5 and contest it. However, this would draw Black's king away from my kingside pawns.\n\nAfter careful consideration, advancing my king toward the center with c4d3 seems best, as it maintains flexibility while increasing my king's activity.\n\n```\nc4d3\n```"
