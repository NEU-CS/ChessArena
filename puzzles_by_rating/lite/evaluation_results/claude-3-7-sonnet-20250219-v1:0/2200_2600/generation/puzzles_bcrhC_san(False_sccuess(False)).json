When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's king is under attack from the knight on f8\n2. Black's knight on e2 is threatening White's rook\n3. Black has a material advantage (knight and bishop vs knight)\n\nLet me consider the most critical moves:\n\n1. King moves to escape check:\n   - g8h8: Moving to the corner\n   - g8f7: Moving to the 7th rank\n   \n2. Capturing the knight with the queen:\n   - d8f8: Taking the attacking knight\n\n3. Knight moves that maintain the attack on White's rook:\n   - e2g3, e2g1, e2c3, e2c1: These maintain the attack on f1\n\nLet's evaluate these options:\n\nIf g8h8, White could follow with Qh4 threatening mate, which would be dangerous.\n\nIf g8f7, this exposes the king to potential attacks along the 7th rank.\n\nIf d8f8 (capturing the knight), this seems most natural as it removes the immediate threat and gains material.\n\nFor the knight moves, e2g1 would fork White's king and rook, winning material.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I see that e2g1 is a winning move as it creates a fork between White's king on h1 and rook on f1. White cannot save both pieces.\n\n```\ne2g1\n```"
