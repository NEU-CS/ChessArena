When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me analyze each legal move:\n\n1. King moves (f2g2, f2e2, f2g1, f2f1, f2e1):\n   - The most important factor is king activity and opposition\n   - Moving toward the black pawns might be beneficial\n   - Need to prevent the black king from penetrating\n\n2. Pawn moves (a3a4, h2h3, h2h4):\n   - a3a4 would attack the b5 pawn\n   - h2h3 or h2h4 would advance the h-pawn\n\nThe black king is currently on f4, threatening to approach our kingside pawns. I need to keep my king active to prevent this.\n\nLooking at f2g2: This move maintains control of the h-pawn while moving slightly closer to the g5 pawn. It keeps good opposition against the black king.\n\nLooking at a3a4: This creates a direct threat to the b5 pawn, forcing black to defend it or lose material.\n\nThe critical decision is whether to focus on king activity or create a concrete threat with the a-pawn.\n\nSince the black king is already quite active and threatening our kingside, I believe creating a concrete threat with a3a4 is best. This forces black to respond to our threat rather than continuing their king's advance.\n\n```\na3a4\n```"
