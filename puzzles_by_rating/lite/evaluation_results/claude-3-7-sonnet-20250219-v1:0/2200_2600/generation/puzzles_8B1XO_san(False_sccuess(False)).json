When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a rook, bishop, and queen vs White's rook, bishop, knight, and queen. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed with the White queen on f4 pointing in that direction.\n- Threats: White's knight on d6 is threatening pieces, and White's queen on f4 is creating pressure.\n- Black has a powerful rook on c2 that's infiltrated White's position.\n\nLet me look at immediate threats:\n1. White's knight on d6 is threatening Black's bishop on e6.\n2. Black's rook on c2 is attacking White's bishop on g2.\n3. Black's queen on b4 is not immediately threatened.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. `c2g2` - Capturing White's bishop seems strong, removing a defender.\n2. `b4d6` - Capturing White's knight would eliminate a threat.\n3. `e6f7` - Moving the bishop to safety.\n4. `c2c1` - Threatening White's rook.\n\nAnalyzing each option:\n- `c2g2`: This captures a bishop and removes a defender of White's king. After this, White might recapture with the king, weakening its position.\n- `b4d6`: This eliminates the knight but allows White to recapture with the f-pawn, which would be very dangerous for Black's king.\n- `e6f7`: This saves the bishop but is passive.\n- `c2c1`: This threatens White's rook but White can simply move it.\n\nThe capture `c2g2` seems strongest as it removes a defender near White's king and gives Black a material advantage. After Kxg2, Black could follow up with queen moves threatening checkmate.\n\n```\nc2g2\n```"
