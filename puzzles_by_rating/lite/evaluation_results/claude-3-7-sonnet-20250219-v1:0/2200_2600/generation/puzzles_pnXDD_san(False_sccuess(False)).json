When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King activity and position\n2. Pawn structure and potential passed pawns\n3. Potential for king opposition\n4. Threats from either side\n\nLet me analyze each legal move:\n\n**King moves:**\n- `c7d8`: Moves away from the center and from controlling the b5 pawn\n- `c7c8`: Moves away from the center and from controlling the b5 pawn\n- `c7b8`: Moves away from the center and from controlling the b5 pawn\n- `c7d7`: Stays active but loses some control over the b5 pawn\n- `c7b7`: Stays active and maintains control over the b5 pawn\n\n**Pawn moves:**\n- `f6f5`: Creates a protected passed pawn on f5, potentially forcing White to deal with it\n- `e6e5`: Creates a pawn duo on e5/f6 that can advance together\n\nThe critical factor here is the race between kings to support their pawns. Black needs to keep the king active while also creating passed pawns.\n\n`f6f5` looks strong as it creates a protected passed pawn that White must deal with. This could force White's king to move away from the queenside, giving Black's king time to capture the b5 pawn.\n\n`c7b7` keeps the king active and maintains control over the b5 pawn, which is also strong.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe `f6f5` is the best move as it creates the most immediate threat and forces White to respond to it, while Black's king is already well positioned.\n\n```\nf6f5\n```"
