When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Check for immediate checkmate opportunities\n2. Prevent Black's pawn promotion\n3. Look for ways to force a win\n\nLet me analyze the position:\n\nBlack's pawn on b2 is dangerous and needs to be addressed. If Black promotes, they'll have a material advantage. I need to either capture the pawn or deliver checkmate first.\n\nLooking at potential checkmate patterns:\n- The black king is on b3, somewhat exposed\n- Can I deliver check while controlling promotion squares?\n\nExamining queen moves:\n- Qd4-b2 directly captures the pawn, eliminating the promotion threat\n- Qd4-c3+ gives check and attacks the king, but the king can escape to a2 or a4\n- Qd4-a4+ gives check but king can escape to c2\n\nThe move Qd4-b2 stands out as it captures the dangerous pawn and prevents promotion. After Qb2, Black would be down to just king and queen vs our king and queen, which should be a draw with perfect play.\n\nLet me check if there are any better options:\n- No immediate checkmate seems available\n- No other move addresses the pawn threat as directly\n\n```\nd4b2\n```"
