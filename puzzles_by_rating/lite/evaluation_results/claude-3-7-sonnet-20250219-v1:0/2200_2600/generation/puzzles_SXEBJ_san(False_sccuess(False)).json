When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook and 3 pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, and 2 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on f1, Black's on g8.\n- Piece activity: White's rook on c7 is active, attacking Black's a7 pawn. Black's rook on g5 is threatening White's h5 pawn.\n- Threats: Black's bishop on b2 is attacking White's a1 rook.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Black's bishop on b2 is threatening White's rook on a1.\n2. White's rook on c7 is attacking Black's a7 pawn.\n3. Black's rook on g5 is threatening White's h5 pawn.\n\nLet me evaluate the most promising moves:\n\n1. c7c8+ - Checking the king, but after Kg7, White gains nothing.\n\n2. c7g7+ - This is a direct check that forces Kxg7, after which White can capture the rook with hxg5. This would leave White up material.\n\n3. c7a7 - Capturing the pawn, but after Bxa1, White loses a rook for a pawn.\n\n4. h5h6 - Advancing the pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats.\n\n5. a1b1 - Moving the rook away from the bishop's attack, but passive.\n\nThe move c7g7+ stands out as it forces a sequence where White wins material. Let's verify:\n- c7g7+ Kxg7\n- hxg5 and White is up a rook for a bishop\n\nThis is clearly winning for White as we'd be up significant material after the exchange.\n\n```\nc7g7\n```"
