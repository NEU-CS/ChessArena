When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King moves (g1h2, g1h1, g1f1):\n   - These are all defensive king moves with no immediate tactical advantage\n   - g1h2 moves toward the kingside where Black's pieces are concentrated\n   - g1h1 moves to the corner, which can be restrictive\n   - g1f1 moves toward the center but could be exposed\n\n2. e3g3 (Rook move):\n   - This move positions my rook on the g-file, putting pressure on Black's queen\n   - It creates a threat against the Black queen on g5\n   - The queen would need to retreat, giving me tempo\n\nThe e3g3 move stands out as the only active option. It forces Black's queen to move, gaining tempo. The other moves are passive king moves with no immediate benefit.\n\nAfter e3g3, Black's queen must retreat, and I can continue developing my position. This is clearly the most aggressive and advantageous move available.\n\n```\ne3g3\n```"
