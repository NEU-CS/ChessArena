When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material is roughly equal (Black has Q+2B+2R+2N+7P vs White's Q+2B+2R+2N+7P)\n- Black's king is still in the center while White has castled\n- Black's queen is active on a4\n- White has a bishop on g5 pinning Black's knight on d5 to the king\n- Black has the option to castle kingside (e8g8)\n\nKey considerations:\n1. King safety is a priority - castling should be considered\n2. The pinned knight on d5 is a concern\n3. Black's queen is active but potentially vulnerable\n4. Development and piece coordination need attention\n\nLet's evaluate the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **e8g8** (castling kingside): This improves king safety immediately and connects the rooks.\n\n2. **a4a2**: This captures White's a-pawn, but might lose time as White develops counterplay.\n\n3. **g7f6**: This attacks White's bishop on g5, addressing the pin on the knight.\n\n4. **d5f6**: This knight move escapes the pin and attacks the bishop on g5.\n\n5. **a4b3**: This queen move threatens White's knight on c4 while maintaining pressure.\n\nAfter analyzing these options:\n- Castling (e8g8) is very strong as it addresses king safety immediately\n- g7f6 addresses the pin but leaves the king in the center\n- d5f6 escapes the pin but might allow White to capture on f6 with the bishop\n\nThe most urgent priority is king safety, especially since White is already castled and could launch an attack on Black's central king. Castling gets the king to safety and connects the rooks, improving Black's position significantly.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
