When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, rook, and 6 pawns. So material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on f7, somewhat exposed. White's king is on g1, well protected.\n- Pawn structure: White has an advanced pawn on f5, which could be dangerous.\n- Piece activity: Black's pieces seem active, with the queen on c6, rook on c5, and bishop on e5.\n\nLet me evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. **f7f8**: King move to the back rank. This seems passive and doesn't improve Black's position.\n\n2. **f7e8**: Similar to f7f8, a passive king move that doesn't address any immediate threats.\n\n3. **f7e7**: Another passive king move, not improving the position.\n\n4. **f7f6**: Moving the king to f6 would place it closer to White's advanced f5 pawn, which seems risky.\n\n5. **c6d5**: Moving the queen to d5. This controls important central squares and puts pressure on White's position.\n\n6. **c5d5**: Moving the rook to d5. This would control the d-file but loses control of the c-file.\n\n7. **c5c4**: Advancing the rook to c4. This threatens White's b-pawn and increases rook activity.\n\n8. **d6d5**: Advancing the d-pawn. This challenges White's control of the center but might weaken the pawn structure.\n\nAmong these moves, I see two particularly strong candidates: **c6d5** and **c5c4**.\n\n**c6d5** places the queen on a strong central square, controlling important diagonals and putting pressure on White's position.\n\n**c5c4** increases the rook's activity and creates direct threats against White's queenside pawns.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe **c5c4** is the strongest move. It activates the rook, threatens White's b-pawn, and creates concrete pressure. The rook on the 4th rank will be well-positioned for both attack and defense.\n\n```\nc5c4\n```"
