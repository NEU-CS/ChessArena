When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I need to analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the material and position:\n- Material: White has a queen, bishop, and several pawns. Black has a queen, knight, and several pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- Position: Black's king is in the corner at h8, potentially vulnerable. White's queen is on a7, actively placed.\n- Threats: Black's knight on e3 is threatening White's position.\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. Queen moves:\n   - The queen on a7 has many options. I should look for checks or attacking opportunities.\n   - a7b8 would exchange queens, but is this favorable?\n   - a7g7 threatens h7 pawn and puts pressure near Black's king\n   - a7a8 would be a check\n\n2. Bishop moves:\n   - g2e4 would capture Black's pawn, but loses the bishop to the knight\n   - g2f3 would attack the knight\n\n3. King moves:\n   - Moving the king doesn't seem to create immediate threats\n\n4. Pawn moves:\n   - No immediate threats with pawn moves\n\nThe most promising moves seem to be:\n- a7g7: Attacking the h7 pawn and pressuring Black's king area\n- a7a8+: Giving a check\n- g2f3: Attacking Black's knight\n\nLooking at a7g7, this move threatens the h7 pawn and creates pressure near Black's king. If Black defends with Qc6, White can continue the attack.\n\nLooking at a7a8+, this forces Black's king to move to g8, but doesn't seem to lead to a clear advantage.\n\nLooking at g2f3, this attacks the knight on e3, but Black can simply capture with exf3, and White doesn't gain much.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe a7g7 is the strongest move, creating the most pressure and threats against Black's king position.\n\n```\na7g7\n```"
