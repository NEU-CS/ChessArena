When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a rook and two pawns (7 points). So White has a slight material advantage.\n- King positions: Black's king is on d8, White's king is on e4.\n- White's rook is on h5, potentially threatening to come to the 8th rank.\n- Black's knight on e2 is active and could be important.\n- Black's bishop on d6 controls the a3-f8 diagonal.\n- Black has a pawn on b4 and c6, White has pawns on b2, c2, and f2.\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. Knight moves:\n   - e2f4+ would give a check and attack the White king\n   - e2g3+ would also give a check\n   - e2c3 threatens White's c2 pawn\n   - Other knight moves seem less impactful\n\n2. King moves:\n   - Moving the king to safety is important, but no immediate threats require it\n\n3. Bishop moves:\n   - d6e5 would control more squares and maintain diagonal control\n   - d6f4 would attack the White king\n\n4. Pawn moves:\n   - b4b3 would advance the passed pawn, potentially creating a distraction\n\nThe knight checks look most forcing, so let me analyze those first:\n\ne2f4+ would check the king, but after Ke5 or Kd4, the knight could be vulnerable.\ne2g3+ would check the king, and after Kd4 or Kf4, the knight remains relatively safe.\n\nLooking deeper, I notice that e2g3+ followed by Kf4 would allow d6f4! winning the rook after the king moves.\n\nLet me verify this tactic:\n1. e2g3+ (knight check)\n2. If Kf4, then d6f4 wins the rook\n3. If Kd4, Black can play something like d6e5+ followed by capturing the rook\n\nThis seems like a strong tactical sequence that would give Black a decisive advantage.\n\n```\ne2g3\n```"
