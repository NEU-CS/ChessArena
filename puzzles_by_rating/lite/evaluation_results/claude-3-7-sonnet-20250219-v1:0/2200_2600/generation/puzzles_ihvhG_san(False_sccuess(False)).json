When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, a bishop, and 6 pawns. Black has a queen, 2 rooks, a bishop, a knight, and 6 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- White has two knights in strong positions, particularly the knight on d5 which is centralized.\n- Black has a pawn on g3 that threatens White's position.\n- White's king is castled while Black's king is still in the center.\n- White has development advantage with all pieces activated.\n\nLet's consider the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. Knight captures: d5e7, d5c7, d5f6\n   - d5e7 would fork Black's king and rook, winning material\n   - d5c7 would fork Black's queen and rook, winning material\n   - d5f6 would attack Black's king position\n\n2. Bishop moves: e2h5, e2g4, e2f3\n   - These could develop counterplay against Black's kingside\n\n3. Knight moves from d2: d2f3 would address the g3 pawn threat\n\n4. Rook moves: f1f7 could be aggressive against Black's position\n\nLooking at the knight fork options, d5e7 would win a rook for a knight since Black's king would have to move, abandoning the rook. Similarly, d5c7 would win material by forking queen and rook.\n\nThe move d5c7 stands out as particularly strong because it forks Black's queen and rook. Black would have to move the queen, allowing White to capture the rook on a8, winning material.\n\nLet me double-check this analysis:\n- Knight on d5 to c7 forks Black's queen on d8 and rook on a8\n- Black must move the queen to save it\n- White can then capture the rook, gaining a significant material advantage\n\nThis is a clear tactical opportunity that White should exploit.\n\n```\nd5c7\n```"
