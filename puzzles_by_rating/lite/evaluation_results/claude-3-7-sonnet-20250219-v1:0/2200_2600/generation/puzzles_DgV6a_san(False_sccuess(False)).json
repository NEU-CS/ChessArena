When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a king, knight, and 3 pawns.\n- Material is equal, but the position is complex.\n- White's knight on c5 is active and threatening.\n- Black's bishop on b1 is oddly placed but alive.\n- Black's king is on c7, while White's king is on f4.\n\nLet me evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. King moves (c7d8, c7c8, c7b8, c7d6, c7c6):\n   - Need to consider knight threats and king activity.\n   - c7d6 might be good to approach the center.\n\n2. Bishop moves (g4f5, g4h3, g4f3, g4e2, g4d1):\n   - The bishop is currently on g4, attacking the knight on c5.\n   - Moving it would lose this pressure.\n\n3. Pawn moves (g7g6, e6e5, h5h4, d5d4, g7g5):\n   - d5d4? This isn't possible as there's no Black pawn on d5. This must be a mistake in the legal moves list.\n   - e6e5 could create space.\n   - h5h4 advances a passed pawn.\n   - g7g5 creates a connected passed pawn structure.\n\nLooking at the position again, I notice the White knight on c5 is attacking the e6 pawn. I need to either defend it or create counterplay.\n\nThe move g7g5 looks promising as it:\n1. Creates a connected passed pawn structure\n2. Threatens to advance further\n3. Doesn't weaken the king position\n\nThis seems like the most dynamic option that gives Black good winning chances by creating passed pawns on the kingside.\n\n```\ng7g5\n```"
