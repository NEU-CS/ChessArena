When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a bishop on e5, pawns on c2, d4, f5, h3, and the king on h5.\n- King positions: Black king on f7, White king on h5.\n- Pawn structure: White's f5 pawn is threatening Black's g5 pawn.\n- Key threats: White's bishop on e5 is attacking Black's c7 square and controlling important diagonals.\n\nLet me evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. **f8g7**: Moving the bishop to g7 defends the g5 pawn but leaves the bishop somewhat passive.\n\n2. **f8e7**: This move blocks the king's potential retreat to e7 and doesn't address immediate threats.\n\n3. **f8d6**: This move puts the bishop on a good diagonal but doesn't address immediate threats.\n\n4. **f8c5**: This move attacks White's d4 pawn but might allow the bishop to be exchanged.\n\n5. **f8b4**: This move puts the bishop on an active diagonal but doesn't address immediate threats.\n\n6. **f8a3**: This move puts the bishop far away from the king and doesn't address immediate threats.\n\n7. **f7g8**: Moving the king away from the center seems passive and doesn't improve Black's position.\n\n8. **f7e8**: Similar to g8, this is a passive king move.\n\n9. **f7e7**: This keeps the king more central but doesn't address immediate threats.\n\n10. **c6c5**: This challenges White's d4 pawn and opens lines for the bishop, potentially creating counterplay.\n\n11. **g5g4**: This move attacks White's king directly and creates threats. If White captures with hxg4, Black's h6 pawn will be closer to promotion.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe **g5g4** is the strongest move. It directly attacks White's king, forcing a response, and creates potential promotion threats with the h-pawn if White captures. This active approach gives Black the best practical chances.\n\n```\ng5g4\n```"
