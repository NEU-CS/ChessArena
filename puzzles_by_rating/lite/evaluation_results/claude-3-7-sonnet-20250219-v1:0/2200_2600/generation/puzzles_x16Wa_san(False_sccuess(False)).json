If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a significant material advantage with the rook vs knight\n2. Black's knight on c6 is active\n3. White's rook on c5 is well-positioned and attacking the b5 square\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **c5c6**: Attacking the knight directly. If Black moves the knight, White can potentially win the b7 pawn.\n\n2. **c5e5**: Capturing Black's e5 pawn. This would win a pawn but needs calculation to ensure it's safe.\n\n3. **b4b5**: This move attacks the a6 pawn and restricts Black's knight.\n\n4. **c5d5**: Controlling more central squares and putting pressure on e5 pawn.\n\nLet me analyze these more deeply:\n\nFor **c5e5** (capturing the pawn):\nAfter 1.Rxe5, Black could play 1...Nxe5, and White would lose the rook for a knight and pawn, which is bad for White.\n\nFor **c5c6**:\nThis attacks the knight. If 1.Rc6+ Ke7 2.Rxc6 bxc6, White wins a piece for a pawn.\n\nFor **b4b5**:\nThis attacks the a6 pawn, but after 1.b5 axb5 2.Rxb5, White wins a pawn.\n\nFor **c5d5**:\nThis controls more central squares but doesn't win material immediately.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the strongest move is c5c6, attacking the knight with check. This forces Black to move the king, allowing White to capture the knight on the next move, winning a piece.\n\n```\nc5c6\n```"
