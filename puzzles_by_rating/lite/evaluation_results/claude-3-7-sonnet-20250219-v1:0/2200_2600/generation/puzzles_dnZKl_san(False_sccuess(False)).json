If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King activity and position\n2. Pawn structure and potential passed pawns\n3. Potential breakthrough opportunities\n4. Preventing White's counterplay\n\nLet me analyze the candidate moves:\n\n1. King moves (b6c7, b6b7, b6a7, b6c6, b6a6, b6a5):\n   - Moving the king toward the queenside pawns could help advance them\n   - Moving toward the center might contest White's king position\n\n2. Pawn moves (b5a4, h6h5, c5c4, b5b4):\n   - b5a4 captures White's pawn but loses a pawn structure\n   - h6h5 challenges White's g4 pawn\n   - c5c4 creates a passed pawn but might be vulnerable\n   - b5b4 advances the queenside pawn majority\n\nThe most critical factor here is the queenside pawn majority. Black should try to create passed pawns there while the White king is distant.\n\nLooking at c5c4: This creates a passed pawn immediately. White's king would need multiple moves to reach the queenside, giving Black a significant advantage.\n\nLooking at b5b4: This advances the pawn majority but doesn't create an immediate passed pawn.\n\nLooking at b5a4: This captures a pawn but disrupts Black's pawn structure.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the strongest move is c5c4, creating an immediate passed pawn while the White king is too far away to stop it. This should give Black a decisive advantage.\n\n```\nc5c4\n```"
