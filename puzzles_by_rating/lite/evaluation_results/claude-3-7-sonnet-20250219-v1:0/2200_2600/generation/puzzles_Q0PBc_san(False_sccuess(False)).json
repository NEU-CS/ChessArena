When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, bishop, and 5 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is in the corner with a rook nearby. White's king is also somewhat exposed.\n- Piece activity: White's queen on e6 is very active and threatening. The bishop on d5 is also well placed.\n\nLet me consider the immediate threats:\n- White's queen on e6 threatens Black's queen on g7\n- White's bishop on d5 controls important diagonals\n\nLooking at Black's options:\n1. Queen moves:\n   - Moving the queen to safety is a priority since it's under attack\n   - g7h6 looks safe but blocks a potential escape square for the king\n   - g7f6 would be captured by White's queen\n   - g7f7 looks reasonable to protect the rook and stay active\n   - g7e5 could be interesting to attack White's bishop\n\n2. Rook moves:\n   - The rook isn't immediately threatened\n   - f8f7 could protect the queen but blocks its retreat\n   \n3. Pawn moves:\n   - f5f4 could gain space and attack White's structure\n   - b7b5/b6 don't address immediate concerns\n\nAfter analyzing the candidate moves, I believe g7f7 is best. It moves the queen to safety, protects the rook, and maintains an active position. The queen remains flexible on f7 and can still influence the game.\n\n```\ng7f7\n```"
