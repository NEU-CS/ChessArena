When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, two rooks, two knights, a bishop, and pawns. Black has two rooks, a king, two bishops, a queen, and pawns.\n- King safety: White's king is on b3, somewhat exposed. Black's king is on d7.\n- Threats: White has a knight on f7 and queen on b7, both very close to Black's king.\n\nThis position looks very favorable for White, with pieces actively positioned near the Black king. Let's explore the most promising moves:\n\n1. **Knight captures on h8 (f7h8)**: Taking a rook, but this moves away from the attack on the king.\n\n2. **Knight captures on d8 (f7d8)**: This is a fork between the rook on h8 and potentially threatening the king.\n\n3. **Queen moves (b7c8, b7a8)**: These would capture a rook but might lose the pressure on the king.\n\n4. **Queen moves (b7c7)**: This directly checks the Black king.\n\nLooking at b7c7, this puts the king in check and forces it to move. After the king moves, we could potentially follow up with more attacks. This seems very strong.\n\nLet's also consider if there are any immediate checkmate possibilities. With the knight on f7 and queen on b7, we have strong attacking pieces, but I don't see an immediate mate.\n\nThe move b7c7+ (queen check) seems most forcing and maintains our attack. After the king moves (likely to e7 or e8), we can continue the attack with our well-positioned pieces.\n\n```\nb7c7\n```"
