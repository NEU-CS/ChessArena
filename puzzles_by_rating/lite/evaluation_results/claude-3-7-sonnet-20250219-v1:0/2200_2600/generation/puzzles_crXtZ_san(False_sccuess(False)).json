If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If White gets a queen, Black will be completely lost. I need to either capture this pawn or create a decisive counterattack.\n\nLet's examine my options:\n1. Capture the e7 pawn with the rook: e4e7\n   This directly addresses the immediate threat and seems most logical.\n\n2. Block the pawn with e4e6\n   This doesn't solve the problem as White can just capture with the rook.\n\n3. Create counterplay with the bishop on d4\n   None of the bishop moves seem to create sufficient counterplay to offset the pawn promotion.\n\n4. King moves\n   Moving the king doesn't address the immediate threat.\n\nThe move e4e7 (capturing the pawn with the rook) is clearly the best option as it eliminates the immediate threat of promotion. After this capture, Black will be up a pawn and in a much better position.\n\n```\ne4e7\n```"
