When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

After Kf7, White can capture the rook with Rd8xc8.\n\n2. **e5e8#**: This looks like an immediate checkmate! The Black king on f8 has no legal moves as all surrounding squares are either attacked or blocked.\n\n3. **d7f7+**: This would be checkmate if the king had no escape, but Black can capture with Kxf7.\n\nLet me verify e5e8#:\n- The e8 square is controlled by the rook on e5\n- The f7 square is controlled by the rook on d7\n- The g7 square is controlled by the rook on d7\n- The g8 square is controlled by the rook on d7\n- The f8 is where the king is currently located\n\nYes, this is checkmate! The rook on e5 can move to e8, delivering checkmate as the Black king has no legal moves.\n\n```\ne5e8\n```"
