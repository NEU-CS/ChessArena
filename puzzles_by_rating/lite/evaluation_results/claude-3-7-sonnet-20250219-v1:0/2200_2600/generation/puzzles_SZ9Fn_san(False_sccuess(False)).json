When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, knight, and pawns.\n- King safety: Black's king is on h6, somewhat exposed. White's king is on g2.\n- Threats: Black's queen on g4 and bishop on d4 are active pieces that could create threats.\n\nLet me check for immediate tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Looking at Black's queen on g4:\n   - It controls important squares and could potentially attack White's king\n   - The move g4f3+ looks promising as it checks the White king\n\n2. Looking at Black's bishop on d4:\n   - It's on a strong diagonal\n   - The move d4f2 would attack White's king directly\n\nLet me analyze d4f2:\n- This move attacks the White king directly\n- White would be forced to capture with Kxf2\n- After Kxf2, Black could play g4f3+ forcing the king to move\n- This looks like a winning sequence for Black\n\nLet's double-check if there are any better moves:\n- g4f3+ immediately doesn't work as well because White can block with the queen\n- Other queen moves don't create immediate threats\n- The bishop move d4f2 creates the most immediate pressure\n\nAfter careful analysis, the bishop move to f2 creates a decisive attack on White's king.\n\n```\nd4f2\n```"
