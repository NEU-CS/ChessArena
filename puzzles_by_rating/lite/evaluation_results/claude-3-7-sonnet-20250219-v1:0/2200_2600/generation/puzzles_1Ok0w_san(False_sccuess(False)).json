When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, three pawns, and a king.\n- King safety: White's king is on e1, Black's king is on e6.\n- Pawn structure: White has a passed c-pawn on c5, which could be valuable.\n- Black's queen on b7 is active and could be threatening.\n\nLet's consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **Queen moves**: \n   - a3a7 would trade queens, but after Black recaptures with the pawn, we'd be in a losing king and pawn endgame.\n   - a3b3 or similar moves keep the queen active but don't improve our position significantly.\n\n2. **King moves**:\n   - Moving the king toward the center with e1d2 or e1e2 could be good to activate it.\n\n3. **Pawn advances**:\n   - c5c6 advances our passed pawn, which could be strong.\n   - g3g4 or h2h3/h4 don't seem to offer immediate benefits.\n\nThe c5-c6 pawn push stands out as particularly strong. It threatens to promote, forcing Black to deal with it. If Black captures with the king, our queen can attack from behind.\n\nLet's check if there are any immediate tactical opportunities with the queen. Moving to a7 forces a queen trade but leaves us in a lost endgame. No other queen moves seem to offer immediate tactical advantages.\n\nThe most promising move is advancing our passed pawn with c5c6, creating a serious promotion threat that Black must address immediately.\n\n```\nc5c6\n```"
