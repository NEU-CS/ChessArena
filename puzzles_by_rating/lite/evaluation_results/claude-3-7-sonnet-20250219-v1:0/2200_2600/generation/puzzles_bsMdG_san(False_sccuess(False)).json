When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King moves (e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7d7):\n   - These are passive and don't address the immediate tactical situation\n   - The king should stay centralized to help with the pawn race\n\n2. f7f6:\n   - This defends the g5 pawn but doesn't advance Black's position significantly\n\n3. a6a5:\n   - This advances a queenside pawn but is too slow for the current position\n\n4. g5g4+:\n   - This is a check that forces the white king to move\n   - After hxg4, Black has f5-f4 creating connected passed pawns\n   - This creates immediate threats and accelerates Black's counterplay\n\n5. f5f4:\n   - This directly creates a passed pawn\n   - It threatens to advance further and promotes faster than White's pawns\n   - This is the most direct way to create winning chances\n\nComparing g5g4+ and f5f4:\n- g5g4+ forces the white king to move but after hxg4, we still need to play f5f4\n- f5f4 immediately creates the passed pawn without giving White a chance to capture another pawn\n\nThe f5f4 move creates an immediate passed pawn that will require White's attention. This is the most forcing and direct path to victory, as it creates the greatest threats and gives Black the best winning chances.\n\n```\nf5f4\n```"
