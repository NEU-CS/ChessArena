When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on b8, somewhat exposed. White's king is on g1 behind pawns.\n- Piece activity: Black has an active queen on d5 and rook on h4 that seem to be targeting White's kingside.\n- Threats: The rook on h4 is applying pressure, and the queen on d5 controls important squares.\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **d5g2**: Queen captures pawn with check. This looks very strong as it attacks the white king directly and wins material.\n\n2. **h4g4**: Rook moves to g4, increasing pressure on the kingside, but doesn't seem as immediate as the queen capture.\n\n3. **d5f3**: Queen attacks the rook on f1, but White can defend it.\n\n4. **f6d4**: Knight to d4 could be strong, attacking c2 and controlling central squares.\n\nLet me analyze the most promising move, d5g2:\n- It's a check, forcing White to respond\n- It captures a pawn, winning material\n- After Kg1-h1, Black can continue the attack with moves like Rh4-g4\n\nThis is clearly the strongest move as it combines a tactical gain (winning a pawn) with increasing attacking pressure on White's king. The check forces White to respond, giving Black the initiative.\n\n```\nd5g2\n```"
