If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Pawn moves (f5f8, f5f7, f5f6, e5e6):\n   - These represent pawn advancement toward promotion\n   - f5f8/f7/f6 would promote the f-pawn, but it's not an immediate promotion\n   - e5e6 advances the e-pawn toward promotion\n\n2. King moves (g2h3, g2f2, g2h1, g2g1, g2f1):\n   - These moves reposition the king, but don't immediately address the winning plan\n\n3. f5g5:\n   - This captures Black's g5 pawn, eliminating one of Black's passed pawns\n\nLooking at the position more deeply, I see that White's connected passed pawns on e5 and f5 are the key to winning. The fastest way to victory is to promote one of these pawns.\n\nThe move f5g5 stands out because:\n1. It captures a pawn, increasing material advantage\n2. It removes Black's g5 pawn which could be dangerous\n3. It maintains White's passed pawn structure\n4. After capturing, the f-pawn becomes a passed g-pawn with a clear path to promotion\n\nThis is clearly the strongest move as it both increases material advantage and maintains White's winning chances through pawn promotion.\n\n```\nf5g5\n```"
