When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, and 7 pawns. White has a queen, two bishops, a rook, a knight, and 7 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is in the center and hasn't castled yet. White's king is on f1.\n- Pawn structure: Black has a passed pawn on c4.\n- Piece activity: Black's knight on e5 is well-placed. The bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.\n\nLet me check for tactical opportunities:\n1. The bishop on b7 is targeting White's kingside.\n2. The knight on e5 is a strong piece that could potentially fork pieces.\n3. Black still has castling rights (both kingside and queenside).\n\nKey candidate moves:\n1. **e8g8** (castling kingside) - This would improve king safety immediately.\n2. **e8c8** (castling queenside) - Alternative castling option.\n3. **b7e4** - Capturing the pawn with the bishop, gaining material.\n4. **e5f3** - Knight fork threatening White's queen and rook.\n5. **e5g4** - Knight move attacking the f-pawn.\n\nAnalyzing the best options:\n- **b7e4**: This captures a pawn, but after fxe4, Black loses the strong bishop for just a pawn.\n- **e5f3**: Looking for a knight fork, but there's no fork on f3 as White's queen isn't on a square that would be attacked.\n- **e8g8**: Castling would secure the king, which is a priority since the king is exposed in the center.\n- **e5g4**: This attacks White's f4 pawn but doesn't seem to gain much.\n\nAfter careful consideration, castling kingside with **e8g8** seems most urgent. It immediately improves king safety, connects the rooks, and prepares for potential counterplay on the kingside. The exposed king in the center is the most pressing issue to address.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
