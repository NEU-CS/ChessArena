White has a king and two pawns (a6, b4).\n- King positions: White's king is on c4, Black's king on e7.\n- The a6 pawn is advanced and potentially dangerous.\n- Black's knight on b5 is active and could be a key piece.\n\nLet's evaluate the key factors:\n1. Material is roughly equal (knight vs two pawns)\n2. White's a6 pawn is a serious promotion threat\n3. Black's knight needs to be used effectively\n4. King activity will be crucial in this endgame\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **b5a7**: Capturing White's advanced pawn eliminates the immediate promotion threat.\n2. **b5c3**: Knight check that forces the white king to move.\n3. **b5d4**: Knight check that forces the white king to move.\n4. **e7d6**: King move toward White's pawn.\n5. **b5c7**: Knight move that controls the a8 promotion square.\n\nAnalysis:\n- The most urgent issue is White's a6 pawn, which is just two moves away from promotion.\n- **b5a7** directly captures this pawn, eliminating the threat. This seems like the most straightforward solution.\n- **b5c7** controls the a8 square but doesn't capture the pawn, allowing White to potentially push to a7.\n- The knight checks (**b5c3**, **b5d4**) force the king to move but don't address the pawn threat directly.\n- King moves don't address the immediate pawn threat.\n\nAfter **b5a7**, White's pawn threat is eliminated, and Black has a material advantage (knight + 2 pawns vs 1 pawn). Black can then use the king and knight to hunt down White's remaining b4 pawn while advancing the own pawns.\n\nThe best move is:\n\n```\nb5a7\n```"

White has a king and two pawns (a6, b5).\n- White's king is on c4, Black's king on e7, and Black's knight on a7.\n- White has just played b4-b5, advancing a pawn.\n- White's a6 pawn is quite advanced and potentially dangerous.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Material is roughly equal, but pawn structure and piece activity are crucial.\n2. White's passed pawns on the queenside are a serious threat.\n3. Black's knight on a7 is somewhat passive.\n4. Black needs to either stop White's pawns or create counterplay.\n\nLet's analyze the most promising moves:\n\n1. Knight moves:\n   - a7b5: Captures White's pawn, eliminating one of the passed pawns. This looks very strong as it removes one of White's main threats.\n   - a7c6: Develops the knight to a more central position but doesn't address the immediate pawn threat.\n   - a7c8: Moves the knight to a less active position.\n\n2. King moves:\n   - Various king moves (e7d6, e7e6, etc.): Need to consider if any help stop White's pawns.\n   - e7d6 would move toward the queenside to help stop the pawns.\n\n3. Pawn moves:\n   - g7g5, h7h5: Create some counterplay but may be too slow.\n\nThe most critical factor is White's passed pawns. If we capture the b5 pawn with the knight, we eliminate one threat and our knight becomes more active.\n\nAfter a7b5, White's only remaining pawn is on a6. Our king can potentially move toward it to prevent promotion, while our knight can help control key squares.\n\nThe move a7b5 stands out as clearly the best option as it:\n1. Captures material (a pawn)\n2. Eliminates one of White's main threats\n3. Activates our knight\n4. Gives us better chances to stop White's remaining a-pawn\n\n```\na7b5\n```"
