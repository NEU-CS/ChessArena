When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a knight, bishop, rook, and 4 pawns. White has a rook, bishop, and 6 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed. White's king is on c3.\n- Threats: White's rook on b1 is threatening Black's knight on c8.\n- Special features: White has a passed pawn on c7 which is dangerous.\n\nLet me evaluate the legal moves:\n\n1. Knight moves (c8e7, c8d6, c8b6):\n   - c8e7: Moves the knight to safety but blocks the rook.\n   - c8d6: Knight would be captured by White's bishop on d6.\n   - c8b6: Knight escapes but can be captured by White's rook.\n\n2. King moves (g7h8, g7g8, g7h7, g7f7):\n   - All king moves seem safe but don't address immediate threats.\n\n3. Rook moves (d7d8, d7f7, d7e7, d7c7, d7d6):\n   - d7d8: Defends against the c7 pawn promotion threat.\n   - d7f7: Doesn't address immediate threats.\n   - d7e7: Doesn't address immediate threats.\n   - d7c7: Captures White's dangerous passed pawn.\n   - d7d6: Captures White's bishop but loses the rook to recapture.\n\n4. Bishop moves (a6b7, a6b5, a6c4, a6d3, a6e2, a6f1):\n   - These moves don't address immediate threats but could develop activity.\n\nThe most critical issue is White's passed pawn on c7, which is one move away from promotion. The knight on c8 is also under attack.\n\nThe best move is clearly d7c7, capturing White's dangerous passed pawn. This eliminates White's immediate threat of promotion and maintains material balance. After this move, Black will have addressed the most pressing threat and can continue developing a counterattack.\n\n```\nd7c7\n```"
