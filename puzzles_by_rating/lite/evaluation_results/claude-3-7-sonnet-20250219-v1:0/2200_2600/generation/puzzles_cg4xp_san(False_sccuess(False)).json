When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has 1 rook, 1 knight, 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- Black's rook on f8 and knight on f4 are active pieces.\n- White's rooks are on d2 and h3, with the h3 rook somewhat passive.\n- Black's pawn on d3 is advanced and threatening.\n- The g-pawn structure is locked with White's g4 against Black's g5.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. The d3 pawn is a serious threat that needs addressing.\n2. Black's knight on f4 is attacking White's h3 rook.\n3. White's rooks need better coordination.\n\nLet's analyze the most promising moves:\n\n1. **d2d3**: Capturing the advanced pawn would eliminate the threat, but after Black recaptures with the knight (f4d3), White loses material.\n\n2. **g3f3**: Moving the rook to defend against the knight's attack seems logical, but it's passive.\n\n3. **h3h4**: This attacks Black's g5 pawn, creating a threat while maintaining rook defense.\n\n4. **f2f3**: This would support the g4 pawn and prepare to push back Black's knight, but it's slow.\n\n5. **d2e2**: This improves rook position but doesn't address immediate threats.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe **h3h4** is the best move. It creates an immediate threat to Black's g5 pawn while maintaining defense. If Black captures with gxh4, White's g-pawn becomes a dangerous passed pawn. If Black defends the g5 pawn, White gains time to reorganize.\n\n```\nh3h4\n```"
