When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position step by step to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Roughly equal (White has R+R+B+N+B+Q vs Black's Q+R+R+B+N+B)\n- King safety: White's king is reasonably safe, Black's king is in the corner with some pawn protection\n- Pawn structure: White has advanced the f-pawn to f5, creating some pressure\n- Piece activity: Black has a rook on b4 that's quite active, and pieces aimed at White's kingside\n\nKey observations:\n1. Black's rook on b4 is threatening White's queenside pawns\n2. White's queen on h3 is well-positioned for kingside attack\n3. The f5 pawn is creating tension on the kingside\n4. Black's king is potentially vulnerable in the h8 corner\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **h3h6**: Direct attack on the h6 pawn, threatening the structure around Black's king\n2. **c1g5**: Developing the bishop with attack on f6 knight\n3. **f1f4**: Activating the rook to control the 4th rank and potentially double on the f-file\n4. **c1h6**: Direct bishop sacrifice to open Black's king position\n5. **e4e5**: Central push that attacks the d6 bishop and creates more space\n\nLet's analyze these candidates:\n\n**h3h6**: Taking the h6 pawn exposes Black's king but allows Black to capture with the g-pawn. After gxh6, White doesn't have an immediate follow-up that leads to checkmate. Black's pieces can defend adequately.\n\n**c1g5**: This develops a piece with tempo, attacking the f6 knight. If Black moves the knight, White can consider h3h6 next. However, Black can respond with h6xg5, and after fxg5, the attack doesn't seem decisive yet.\n\n**c1h6**: This bishop sacrifice would open Black's king position, but after gxh6, White doesn't have enough pieces ready to deliver a quick checkmate. The sacrifice seems premature.\n\n**f1f4**: This activates the rook and puts pressure on Black's rook at b4. It also prepares for potential doubling on the f-file. This is a solid positional move.\n\n**e4e5**: This central push attacks Black's bishop on d6 and gains space. If dxe5, fxe6 creates threats. If the bishop retreats, White gains central control.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the most promising move is **c1g5**, developing with tempo and creating threats against Black's kingside. This move improves White's piece activity while threatening the f6 knight, which is an important defender of Black's kingside.\n\n```\nc1g5\n```"
