When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Both sides have a queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on f2, Black's on f7\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have several pawns, with some potential for advancement\n- Queen positions: White's queen on h5, Black's on g6\n\nLet me examine the legal moves:\n\n1. Queen moves (h5 to various squares):\n   - h5h8, h5h7, h5h6: Moving along the h-file doesn't create immediate threats\n   - h5g6: Captures Black's queen - this is a free piece!\n   - h5g5, h5f5: Moving to these squares doesn't create immediate threats\n   - h5h4, h5g4, h5h3, h5h2, h5h1: Moving down the board doesn't create immediate threats\n   \n2. King moves (f2 to e3, e2, f1, e1):\n   - These are just king repositioning moves without immediate tactical value\n   \n3. Pawn move (b4b5):\n   - Advances a pawn but doesn't create immediate threats\n\nThe move h5g6 stands out dramatically as it captures Black's queen for free. This would give White a decisive material advantage (a queen for nothing). After this capture, White would be completely winning.\n\nLet's double-check if there are any tactical issues with capturing the queen:\n- Black's queen on g6 appears to be completely undefended\n- Capturing it doesn't expose White's queen to any immediate threats\n- There are no pins, forks, or other tactical motifs that would make this capture disadvantageous\n\nThe decision is clear:\n\n```\nh5g6\n```"
