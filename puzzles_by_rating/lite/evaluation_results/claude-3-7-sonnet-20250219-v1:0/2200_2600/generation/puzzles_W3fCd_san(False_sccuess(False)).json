When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, bishop, queen, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe, while Black's king is in the center.\n- Piece activity: White has active pieces with the queen on g7 particularly threatening.\n\nLooking at the position, I notice White's queen on g7 is very active and threatening. Let's examine tactical opportunities:\n\n1. The queen on g7 is attacking the rook on h8. Taking it with Qxh8 (g7h8) would win material.\n\n2. The queen is also threatening the f8 square, which could lead to checkmate threats.\n\n3. I should check if there are any immediate checkmate opportunities.\n\nLooking at the position more carefully, I see that Black's king is on c8, and the queen on g7 controls the diagonal toward c7. If I can deliver a check on c7, it could be devastating.\n\nThe move Qf7 (g7f7) looks very strong as it threatens the pawn on e7 and maintains pressure. However, I need to check if there's something even stronger.\n\nActually, I see that Qf8+ (g7f8) is a direct check that forces the king to move, after which White can win material.\n\nLet's analyze Qf8+ (g7f8):\n- Black's king must move to b8 or d8\n- If Kd8, then Qxh8 wins the rook\n- If Kb8, then Qxh8 also wins the rook\n\nThis seems like a clear material gain with no counterplay for Black.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any immediate checkmate opportunities I'm missing.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe Qf8+ is the strongest move as it forces Black's king to move and allows White to win material with a clear advantage.\n\n```\ng7f8\n```"
