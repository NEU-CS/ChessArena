When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Can I promote the c7 pawn immediately?\n2. Can I use my rook to force a win?\n3. Are there any immediate tactical opportunities?\n\nThe c7 pawn is ready to promote, but the Black king on c8 prevents immediate promotion. However, I notice that my rook on e7 can deliver check by moving to e8, forcing the Black king away from c8, which would allow the pawn to promote on the next move.\n\nLet's check: If I play e7e8+, Black's king must move (likely to d7 or b7), then I can promote my c-pawn to a queen and have a completely winning position.\n\nThis is a clear winning sequence:\n1. e7e8+ (check)\n2. After Black king moves\n3. c7c8Q will give me a second queen\n\nThis is much stronger than any other move as it leads to an immediate material advantage that should be decisive.\n\n```\ne7e8\n```"
