When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a bishop pair and a rook for Black's queen, knight, and bishop (roughly equal)\n- White has a bishop on f7 that's attacking the rook on h5\n- White has a bishop on g5 pinning the knight on f6 to the king on f8\n- Black's king is exposed with limited protection\n- Black has a knight on d4 that's attacking central squares\n\nLooking at the position, I notice White has a very strong tactical opportunity. The bishop on f7 is already attacking the rook on h8, and the bishop on g5 is pinning the knight on f6 to the king.\n\nKey tactical ideas:\n1. The bishop on f7 can capture on e8 or g8, delivering check\n2. The bishop on g5 can capture the pinned knight on f6\n\nLet me analyze the most promising moves:\n\n1. f7e8+ (Bishop takes e8 with check)\n   - Black's king must move to e7\n   - This would win material but doesn't seem to lead to immediate checkmate\n\n2. f7g8+ (Bishop takes g8 with check)\n   - Black's king must move to e7\n   - This would win the rook but doesn't lead to immediate checkmate\n\n3. g5f6 (Bishop takes knight)\n   - This captures a piece and maintains pressure\n   - After Black recaptures, White still has the bishop on f7 attacking the rook\n\n4. f7g6 (Bishop moves to g6)\n   - This threatens the rook on h8 and creates additional threats\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the strongest move is to capture the knight with g5f6. This removes a defender, wins material, and maintains the attack on Black's position. Black will likely recapture with a pawn, but White will still have the bishop on f7 attacking the rook on h8.\n\n```\ng5f6\n```"
