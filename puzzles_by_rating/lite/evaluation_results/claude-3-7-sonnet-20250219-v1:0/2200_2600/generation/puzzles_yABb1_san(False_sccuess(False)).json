When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is reasonably safe, while Black's king is somewhat exposed.\n- Piece activity: White's knight on e5 is very active and potentially threatening.\n- Pawn structure: White has a passed c-pawn that could be valuable.\n\nLet me examine the tactical possibilities:\n\n1. Knight moves: The e5 knight has several options. The most interesting is e5f7, which is a fork attacking Black's king and queen.\n\n2. Queen moves: Several options, but nothing immediately decisive.\n\n3. Rook moves: Nothing particularly forcing.\n\nThe knight fork on f7 stands out as the strongest candidate:\n- e5f7 forks Black's king and queen\n- After Kg8-h8, White can capture the queen with Nxc7\n- This would win a queen for a knight, a decisive material advantage\n\nLet's verify there are no better options or defensive resources for Black:\n- After e5f7, Black must move the king (likely to h8)\n- Then White captures the queen with Nxc7\n- Black gets no meaningful counterplay\n\nThis is a clear tactical win for White.\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
