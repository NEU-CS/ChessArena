When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a knight, bishop, and pawns against Black's bishop, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on h1, somewhat exposed with the knight on g4 nearby.\n- Piece activity: White has a knight on d5 in a strong central position, and a bishop on c4.\n- Black's knight on g4 is threatening White's position.\n\nLet's consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves from d5**:\n   - d5e7 would fork Black's queen and rook, winning material\n   - d5c7 would fork Black's queen and rook, winning material\n   - Other knight moves don't seem as strong\n\n2. **Bishop moves from c4**:\n   - None create immediate threats\n\n3. **Queen moves**:\n   - d1g4 would capture Black's knight\n\n4. **Dealing with the g4 knight threat**:\n   - h2h3 would attack the knight\n\nLooking at the two strongest candidates:\n\n**d5e7**: Knight fork targeting Black's queen on d8 and rook on a8. This would win a rook after Black moves the queen.\n\n**d5c7**: Knight fork targeting Black's queen on d8 and rook on f8. This would also win a rook after Black moves the queen.\n\n**d1g4**: Capturing Black's knight directly.\n\nThe knight forks are clearly the strongest moves. Between d5e7 and d5c7, I prefer d5e7 because:\n1. It attacks the more valuable a8 rook (compared to the f8 rook which might be less developed)\n2. After Black moves the queen, we can capture the a8 rook and potentially create threats on the queenside\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd5e7\n```"
