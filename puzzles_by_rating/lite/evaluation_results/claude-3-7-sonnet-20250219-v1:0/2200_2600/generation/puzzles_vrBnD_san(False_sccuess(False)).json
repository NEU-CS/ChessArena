When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is exposed on e7, and White's rook is on f6 and queen on g7, creating serious threats.\n- Immediate threats: White's rook on f6 and queen on g7 are creating a mating threat.\n\nThis position looks extremely dangerous for Black. White is threatening mate with Qg7-e7# or Rf6-f7#. I need to find a defensive move immediately.\n\nLet's examine candidate moves:\n1. King moves: e7e8, e7d8, e7d7 - These would escape the immediate mate threat.\n2. Blocking moves: Can I block the threats with another piece?\n3. Counterattack: Is there a strong counterattack available?\n\nLooking at e7d8:\n- This escapes the immediate mate threat\n- The king would be safer\n\nLooking at e7d7:\n- This also escapes the immediate mate threat\n- The king would have more squares available\n\nLet me check if there are any tactical opportunities:\n- The knight on e5 is attacking White's queen on g7\n- If I could capture the queen with e5g6, that would solve the threats\n\nExamining e5g6:\n- This captures White's queen on g7\n- After Rf6xg6, Black's king would be safe\n- This would leave Black up material\n\nThis is clearly the best move - capturing the queen with the knight solves all immediate threats and wins material.\n\n```\ne5g6\n```"
