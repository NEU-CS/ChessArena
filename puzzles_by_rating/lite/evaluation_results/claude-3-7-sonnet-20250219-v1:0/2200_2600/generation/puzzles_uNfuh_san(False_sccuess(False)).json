When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on f3, Black's on e7.\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have pawns that could potentially promote.\n- Immediate threats: I need to check for any immediate threats or tactical opportunities.\n\nLet me examine the position more deeply:\n\n1) Queen moves:\n   - The White queen on h8 has many possible squares.\n   - I should look for checks, captures, or threats.\n   - Moving to e5 (h8e5) would attack the Black king and pawn on g7.\n   - Moving to f6 (h8f6) would attack the Black king and f7 pawn.\n\n2) King moves:\n   - f3g4 would move toward the center but might be exposed.\n   - f3e2 retreats the king.\n\n3) Pawn moves:\n   - e4e5, c4c5, h3h4, g2g3, g2g4 are all possible.\n\nLooking for tactical opportunities:\n- If I play h8e5, I'm attacking the g5 pawn and putting pressure on the Black king.\n- If I play h8f6+, I give a check and attack the f7 pawn.\n\nThe move h8f6+ seems strongest as it:\n1) Gives check to the Black king\n2) Attacks the f7 pawn\n3) Creates a powerful threat that Black must respond to\n\nAfter h8f6+, Black must move the king, and then I can capture the f7 pawn, gaining material and further weakening Black's position.\n\n```\nh8f6\n```"
