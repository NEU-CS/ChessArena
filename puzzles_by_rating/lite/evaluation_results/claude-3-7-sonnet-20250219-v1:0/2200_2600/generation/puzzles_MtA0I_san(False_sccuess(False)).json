When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this endgame position carefully to find the best move.\n\nFirst, let me understand the position:\n- I'm playing as White\n- Material: White has 3 pawns (e5, f4, g3, h4), Black has 4 pawns (a3, b2, g6, h5) and a king on f5\n- My king is on b1, far from the action on the kingside\n- Black's king is active on f5, contesting my e5 pawn\n\nLet me evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. **b1c2**: Moving my king toward Black's b2 pawn. This would allow me to capture it next move, but Black's a-pawn would continue advancing.\n\n2. **b1a2**: Moving my king to control the a-file, potentially stopping Black's a-pawn, but not immediately capturing the b2 pawn.\n\n3. **e5e6**: Advancing my e-pawn. This creates a passed pawn that could promote, but Black's king is close and might be able to stop it.\n\n4. **g3g4**: Advancing my g-pawn to challenge Black's h5 pawn.\n\nThe critical factor here is the race between my kingside pawns and Black's queenside pawns. My king is far from the kingside action, so I need to either:\n- Create a passed pawn that can promote quickly\n- Capture Black's queenside pawns to slow their advance\n\nLooking at the pawn structure, if I play e5e6, the pawn will be one step closer to promotion. Black's king would need to decide whether to chase it or support his own pawns. This creates a dilemma for Black.\n\nIf I play g3g4, I'm attacking Black's h5 pawn, but after hxg4, fxg4, Black's king can easily stop my pawns.\n\nFor the queenside, capturing the b2 pawn with b1c2 seems most direct, as it immediately removes one of Black's passed pawns.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe advancing the e-pawn gives me the best winning chances by creating a strong passed pawn that will force Black's king to make difficult choices.\n\n```\ne5e6\n```"
