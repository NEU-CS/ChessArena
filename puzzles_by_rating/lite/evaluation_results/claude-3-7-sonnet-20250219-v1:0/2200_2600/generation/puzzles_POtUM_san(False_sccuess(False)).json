When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook, knight, and several pawns. Black has a queen, bishop, knight, and pawns. Material seems roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is exposed with no castling available (only Qq castling rights remain, which are for Black).\n- Piece activity: White has a knight on f4 and a rook on g3. Black has a bishop on h4 pinning White's g3 rook to the king.\n- Threats: The bishop on h4 is pinning White's rook on g3 to the king.\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **Breaking the pin**: \n   - `d1g4` would attack the bishop on h4 while developing the queen.\n   - `f1h3` would block the pin and threaten the bishop.\n\n2. **Knight moves**:\n   - `f4g6` would attack Black's f-pawn.\n   - `f4h5` would attack the bishop on h4.\n\n3. **Development moves**:\n   - `b1c3` would develop a knight.\n   - `c1e3` would develop a bishop.\n\nThe most pressing issue is the pin on the g3 rook. I should either break the pin or use the pin to my advantage.\n\n`d1g4` looks very strong as it:\n1. Attacks the bishop on h4\n2. Develops the queen to an active square\n3. Creates threats against Black's kingside\n4. Prepares potential queen and rook coordination\n\nThis move forces Black to either move the bishop (releasing the pin) or defend it, giving White the initiative.\n\n```\nd1g4\n```"
