If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Let's analyze the key factors:\n\n1. Material: White has a bishop vs Black's two pawns, so material is roughly equal\n2. King position: Black's king is near the h-pawn, which could help with promotion\n3. Pawn structure: Black has connected passed pawns on the h-file\n4. Bishop mobility: The white bishop can control the h1-a8 diagonal\n\nStrategic goals for White:\n- Stop Black's pawns from promoting\n- Use the bishop to capture at least one of Black's pawns\n- Position the king to support the bishop\n\nLet me evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. Bishop moves:\n   - g1h2: This directly attacks the h3 pawn\n   - g1f2: This controls the h4 square but doesn't attack pawns directly\n   - g1a7/b6/c5/d4/e3: These moves leave the bishop far from the action\n\n2. King moves:\n   - e2f3: Approaches Black's king and pawns\n   - e2e3: Moves closer to the pawns\n   - e2d3/d2/f1/e1/d1: These move away from the critical area\n\nThe most promising moves are g1h2 (directly attacking the h3 pawn) and e2f3 (approaching the pawns).\n\nIf g1h2, Black would likely respond with h3g2 to protect the pawn. Then White would need to retreat the bishop.\n\nIf e2f3, White threatens to get closer to the pawns while maintaining the bishop's control.\n\nThe best move is g1h2, directly attacking the h3 pawn. This forces Black to defend immediately and creates the most immediate pressure.\n\n```\ng1h2\n```"
