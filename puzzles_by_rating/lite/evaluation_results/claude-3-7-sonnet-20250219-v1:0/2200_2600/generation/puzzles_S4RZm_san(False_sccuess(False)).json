When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's king is on b7, somewhat exposed\n2. Black has a dangerous passed c-pawn on c3\n3. White has two knights and a bishop that could potentially coordinate for an attack\n4. White's rook on d2 is currently defending against the c3 pawn\n\nKey considerations:\n- The immediate threat is Black's c3 pawn which could promote\n- White needs to either stop this pawn or create a stronger counterattack\n- A checkmate attack against Black's king could be decisive\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n1. Knight moves that attack the king or create threats\n2. Rook moves to counter the c3 pawn\n3. Bishop moves that increase pressure\n\nThe move c7e6 (Knight from c7 to e6) looks particularly strong as it:\n- Creates a double attack on the king and c-pawn\n- Threatens to fork the king and rook\n- Puts pressure on Black's position\n\nThis knight move creates immediate tactical threats while addressing the dangerous c-pawn. Black will be forced to deal with multiple threats at once.\n\n```\nc7e6\n```"
