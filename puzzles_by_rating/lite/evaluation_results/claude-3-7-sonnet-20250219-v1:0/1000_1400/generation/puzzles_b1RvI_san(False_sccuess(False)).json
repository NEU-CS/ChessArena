When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White is up material.\n- Black's king is on e8, and White has a rook on h8 and c7, creating potential mating threats.\n- Black's rook is on f8, defending against immediate checkmate.\n\nLooking at the position, I notice White has a powerful rook on the 7th rank (c7) and another rook on h8 threatening Black's king. This suggests tactical opportunities.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. h8g8 - Capturing the bishop would win material but allows Rxg8\n2. c7c8+ - Checking the king, forcing it to move\n3. c7f7 - Attacking the rook on f8\n4. h8h7 - Moving the rook to the 7th rank for additional pressure\n\nThe most promising move appears to be c7c8+, which forces Black's king to move. After Kd7, White can play Rh7+ followed by Rc7+ and win material or achieve checkmate.\n\nActually, I see an even stronger move: c7f7! This directly attacks Black's rook on f8. If Black captures with Rxf7, then Rg8# is checkmate. If Black moves the king, White can capture the rook and be up even more material.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the best move is:\n\n```\nc7f7\n```"
