When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This would win material.\n2. **c4f7**: Bishop takes pawn, threatening Black's rook on f8.\n3. **c4e6**: Bishop attacking the f7 pawn with a discovered attack.\n\nLooking at b5c7 more deeply:\n- This move forks Black's rook and bishop\n- After Black moves one of these pieces, White can capture the other\n- This is a clear material gain\n\nLooking at c4f7:\n- This captures a pawn and attacks the rook\n- Black can respond with Kg8xf7, and White doesn't gain material\n- Not as strong as the knight fork\n\nLooking at c4e6:\n- This attacks the f7 pawn\n- Black can defend with various moves\n- Not as forcing as the knight fork\n\nThe knight fork with b5c7 is clearly the strongest move, winning material by forcing Black to lose either a rook or bishop. This is a tactical opportunity that should be seized immediately.\n\n```\nb5c7\n```"
