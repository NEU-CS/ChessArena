When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is relatively safe, but White's king also seems secure.\n- Piece activity: Black has active pieces, particularly the rook on d4 and queen on h4.\n\nLet me look for tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Checking for immediate threats:\n   - The rook on d4 is attacking down the d-file\n   - The queen on h4 is eyeing the h-file and diagonal\n   - The rook on f6 controls the f-file\n\n2. Potential tactical ideas:\n   - Queen and rook coordination could lead to checkmate threats\n   - The h4 queen combined with the f6 rook could create pressure on White's kingside\n\nLooking at specific candidate moves:\n\n- `h4g3`: Queen captures rook with check. This is an immediate material gain with check.\n- `d4g4`: Rook captures rook, but White can recapture with the queen.\n- `h4h1`: Queen check on the back rank, but White can block with the rook.\n- `f6f1`: Rook check on the back rank, but White can block with the rook.\n\nThe move `h4g3` stands out as it captures a rook with check, winning material immediately. This is a clear tactical shot that gives Black a decisive advantage.\n\n```\nh4g3\n```"
