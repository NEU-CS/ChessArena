When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I'm playing as Black, and I need to determine the best move from the legal moves provided.\n\nFirst, let me assess the current position:\n- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8\n- White has a queen on h7 and a bishop on g6\n- My pieces include a rook on e7, bishop on c7, queen on d8, and another bishop on h1\n- According to the legal moves list, I only have one option: g8f8 (king move from g8 to f8)\n\nThis is a very constrained position. Let me check why I might only have one legal move:\n\nLooking at the board, I see that White's queen on h7 and bishop on g6 are creating a powerful attack against my king. The bishop on g6 is controlling the h7-b1 diagonal, while the queen on h7 is directly threatening my king. This is why my only legal move is to move my king to f8 to escape the immediate threat.\n\nSince I only have one legal move, I don't need to compare multiple options. The move g8f8 is my only choice to continue the game.\n\n```\ng8f8\n```"
