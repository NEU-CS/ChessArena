When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The b5 pawn is advanced and could become a strong asset\n2. Black's knight on b8 is undeveloped\n3. White's bishop pair (e2+g3) could be powerful\n4. The c4 pawn is potentially vulnerable\n\nLet me evaluate some candidate moves:\n\n1. **b5b6**: Advancing the passed pawn puts pressure on Black's position and threatens to disrupt their queenside.\n\n2. **f2a7**: Queen attack looks tempting but after Qxa7 Nxa7, Black has eliminated our queen and gained material.\n\n3. **f3d4**: Knight to d4 attacks the c-pawn and establishes a strong central outpost.\n\n4. **e2c4**: Bishop captures the c4 pawn, winning material.\n\n5. **f1e1**: Rook to the e-file increases control of the center.\n\nAfter analyzing these options, **e2c4** stands out as the strongest move. It wins a pawn cleanly with no immediate counterplay for Black. The bishop on c4 will also be well-positioned, controlling important central squares and the diagonal toward Black's king.\n\n```\ne2c4\n```"
