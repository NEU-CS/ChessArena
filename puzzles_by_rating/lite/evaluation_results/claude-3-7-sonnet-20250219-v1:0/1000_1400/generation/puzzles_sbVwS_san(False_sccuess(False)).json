When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The c-pawn is already passed, and capturing would make it even more dangerous. After cxb3, White would likely recapture with axb3, and Black would have a strong passed pawn on the c-file.\n\nFor b6b3: This also wins a pawn, but puts the queen on a less active square and loses control of the d8-h4 diagonal.\n\nFor e6g4: This move doesn't win material immediately but increases piece activity.\n\nFor c5d4: This move controls more central squares but doesn't win material.\n\nFor d5d4: This advances a central pawn but doesn't win material.\n\nThe move c4b3 stands out as it wins material and improves Black's pawn structure. It creates a passed pawn that will require White's attention and resources to stop.\n\n```\nc4b3\n```"
