When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White is up a bishop.\n- King safety: White's king is on h1, somewhat exposed. Black's king is on c8, also somewhat exposed.\n- Threats: Black's queen on g3 is threatening White's bishop on g2 and potentially checkmate patterns.\n\nLet's look for tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Checking for immediate checkmate:\n   - The queen on e6 is attacking the c8 square where Black's king is located, but it's not checkmate because the king can move to d8.\n   - However, I notice that with the bishop on f8 and queen on e6, there's a potential mating pattern.\n\n2. The move Qe8# would be checkmate if the c8 square were controlled, which it is by our bishop on f8!\n\nThis is a direct checkmate. The queen moves to e8, and the Black king has no legal moves:\n- Can't move to d8 (controlled by our queen)\n- Can't move to b8 (controlled by our bishop on f8)\n- Can't move to c7 (controlled by our queen on e8)\n\nLet's verify this is a legal move from our list: Yes, e6e8 is in the list of legal moves.\n\nThis is a clear and immediate checkmate, so there's no need to consider other options.\n\n```\ne6e8\n```"
