When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, bishop, knight, and 6 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- Black's knight on d4 is threatening White's bishop on d3.\n- White's knight on c5 is attacking Black's bishop on a6.\n- Black's king position on g7 seems relatively safe.\n\nLet's consider key candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves from c5**:\n   - c5d7 would fork Black's rooks, winning material\n   - c5e6 attacks the f8 rook\n   - Other knight moves seem less impactful\n\n2. **Defending the d3 bishop**:\n   - c2c3 would attack the knight on d4\n   - e3c4 would also attack the knight\n\n3. **Capturing the knight with the bishop**:\n   - d3xd4 would lose the bishop to Black's pawn recapture\n\nThe move c5d7 stands out as particularly strong, as it forks Black's rooks on f8 and a8. This would win material as Black can only save one rook.\n\nLet's double-check if there are any tactical issues with this move:\n- After c5d7, Black's knight on d4 could still capture our bishop on d3\n- However, we would then recapture with a pawn, and we'd still be up a rook for a bishop\n\nThe knight fork on d7 is clearly the strongest move, as it creates an immediate material-winning threat that Black cannot fully address.\n\n```\nc5d7\n```"
