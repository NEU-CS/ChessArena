When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a bishop, knight, rook, and queen vs Black's two bishops, knight, and queen. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe, while Black's king is somewhat exposed.\n- Piece activity: White's bishop on f5 is very active and threatening.\n- Threats: Black's knight on f4 is attacking White's queen on g3.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The bishop on f5 is attacking the h7 square near Black's king.\n2. Black's knight on f4 is threatening White's queen.\n3. White's queen on g3 combined with the bishop on f5 could create mating threats.\n\nLet me consider the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **f5h7+**: This bishop check forces the king to move, potentially setting up a mating attack.\n2. **g3f4**: Capturing the knight that's threatening the queen.\n3. **f5g6**: Attacking the f7 pawn, which is a key defender of Black's king.\n4. **e3g4**: Knight move that attacks Black's knight on f4.\n\nAnalyzing f5h7+:\nAfter Bh7+, Black must respond with Kh8 or Kf8. After Kh8, White can follow with Qh4 threatening mate. This looks very strong.\n\nAnalyzing g3f4:\nCapturing the knight removes a threat but gives up the queen for a knight, which is a poor trade.\n\nAnalyzing f5g6:\nThis attacks the f7 pawn, but Black can simply capture with fxg6, and White doesn't have an immediate follow-up.\n\nAnalyzing e3g4:\nThis attacks Black's knight but doesn't create immediate threats against the king.\n\nThe move Bh7+ (f5h7) creates the most immediate threat and forces Black's king into a vulnerable position. It's the start of a winning attack.\n\n```\nf5h7\n```"
