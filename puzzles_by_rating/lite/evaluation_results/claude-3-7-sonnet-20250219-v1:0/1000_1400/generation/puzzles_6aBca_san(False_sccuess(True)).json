When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: My king is on f2, somewhat exposed. Black's king is on h8 in the corner.\n- Threats: Black's queen on e4 and knight on g4 are creating pressure. The queen is particularly dangerous as it attacks my king's position.\n\nLet me evaluate each legal move:\n\n**Option 1: f2g3 (King to g3)**\nIf I move my king to g3, I'd be moving directly next to Black's knight on g4. This would allow Black to check me with Qe5+ on the next move, forcing my king to move again. After that, Black could potentially capture my h3 pawn with the knight. This seems very dangerous and would put my king in a precarious position.\n\n**Option 2: f2g1 (King to g1)**\nMoving my king to g1 retreats to relative safety. It moves away from Black's queen on e4 and creates fewer immediate tactical vulnerabilities. From g1, my king is better protected and less exposed to checks and attacks.\n\nComparing the two moves:\n- f2g3 moves into danger, potentially facing immediate checks and material loss\n- f2g1 retreats to safety, avoiding immediate tactical threats\n\nGiven that I'm limited to these two moves, the choice is clear. Moving into a check or potential fork is never a good idea when a safer alternative exists.\n\n```\nf2g1\n```"
