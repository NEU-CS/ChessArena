When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a powerful attack with the queen on g7 threatening my king\n2. White's rook on d6 is also putting pressure on my position\n3. White's knight on e6 is controlling important squares\n4. My king on d7 is in a very dangerous position\n\nSince I only have one legal move (d7d6), this suggests I'm in a forced situation, likely in check. Moving my king to d6 would capture White's rook on that square, which would be material gain, but I need to check if this is safe.\n\nAfter d7d6 (capturing the rook), my king would be on d6, but White's knight on e6 would be checking my king. This appears to be a discovered check situation where moving the rook reveals the knight's check.\n\nGiven that this is my only legal move, I must play:\n\n```\nd7d6\n```"
