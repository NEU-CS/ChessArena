I'm playing as Black, and I have only two legal moves: h8g8 or h8g7.\n\nFirst, let me assess the current position:\n- Material: I have a queen, rook, bishop, two knights, and several pawns. White has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, and several pawns.\n- My king is on h8, and White has a bishop on g7 giving check.\n- I only have two legal moves to get out of check: h8g8 or h8g7 (capturing the bishop).\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Option 1: h8g8 (King moves to g8)**\nIf I move my king to g8, I avoid the immediate check but remain in a precarious position. White's queen on h3 is threatening the h-file, and after I move to g8, White could play Qh7+ followed by Qh8# if I don't have adequate defense.\n\n**Option 2: h8g7 (King captures bishop on g7)**\nIf I capture the bishop on g7 with my king, I eliminate the immediate threat and gain material (a bishop). This seems much better as it removes the attacking piece and improves my material balance.\n\nAfter h8g7, White might try to continue the attack with moves like Qh7+, but I would have f8-g8 as an escape square for my king.\n\nThe choice is clear - capturing the bishop improves my position both materially and positionally.\n\n```\nh8g7\n```"
