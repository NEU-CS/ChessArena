When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The material count shows:\n- White: Queen, Rook, Bishop, and 4 pawns\n- Black: Queen, Rook, Knight, and 5 pawns\n\nBlack has a slight material advantage (Knight vs 3 pawns). More importantly, Black's queen is on h3, threatening checkmate on g2 or h1. Black's knight on f4 is also active and threatening. My king is exposed on f1.\n\nLet's analyze each legal move:\n\n1. **f1g1** - Moving the king to g1:\n   - This doesn't address the immediate threat from Black's queen on h3\n   - After this move, Black could play Qh1#, delivering checkmate\n   - This is clearly losing for White\n\n2. **f1e1** - Moving the king to e1:\n   - This evades the immediate checkmate threat\n   - However, Black can play Qh1+ followed by Qxd1, winning my queen\n   - This is a very poor position for White\n\n3. **e4g2** - Moving the bishop to g2:\n   - This blocks the check from Black's queen\n   - The bishop on g2 would be protected by my pawn on f2\n   - This saves my king from immediate checkmate threats\n   - Black's queen would need to retreat or find another plan\n\nClearly, e4g2 is the only move that prevents immediate checkmate and protects my king. It blocks the queen's attack and forces Black to change plans.\n\n```\ne4g2\n```"
