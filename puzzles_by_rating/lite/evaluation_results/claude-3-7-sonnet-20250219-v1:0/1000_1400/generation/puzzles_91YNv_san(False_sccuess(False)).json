When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King moves (d5e6, d5d6, d5c6, d5e5, d5c5, d5d4, d5c4):\n   - I need to consider which king move best supports my pawns or stops White's pawns\n   - The h3 pawn is close to promotion and needs attention\n   - The a5 pawn is opposed by White's a4 pawn\n\n2. Pawn move (h3h2):\n   - This advances my h-pawn one step closer to promotion\n   - After h3h2, White's king at f2 is just two moves away from capturing it\n\nKey strategic considerations:\n- The h-pawn is my most advanced pawn and represents my best winning chance\n- I need to either push it to promotion or use it to distract White's king while my king captures White's pawns\n\nLooking at h3h2:\n- This forces White's king to address the pawn threat immediately\n- While White's king is busy with my h-pawn, I can potentially use my king to capture White's f3 pawn\n\nLooking at king moves:\n- Moving toward White's f3 pawn seems most aggressive (d5e5 or d5e6)\n- d5e5 threatens to approach both the f3 pawn and potentially support my h-pawn's advance\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the best move is to advance the h-pawn with h3h2. This creates an immediate promotion threat that White must address, giving my king time to approach White's pawns. This is a classic distraction tactic in pawn endgames.\n\n```\nh3h2\n```"
