When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

However, Black can simply retreat the bishop to e7 or g7.\n\n2. **f4f5**: This would attack the bishop on g6 and gain space, potentially opening lines against Black's king.\n\n3. **e3c5**: Moving the queen to c5 would put pressure on c5 pawn and create some threats.\n\n4. **c1d2**: Developing the bishop and connecting the rooks.\n\n5. **a1b1**: Simple development move to connect rooks.\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities:\n\nThe f4f5 move seems particularly strong as it attacks the bishop on g6. If Black moves the bishop, White gains space and can potentially open lines against Black's king. If Black captures with gxf5, White recaptures with exf5, opening the e-file against Black's position.\n\nThe move e3c5 also looks interesting as it attacks the c5 pawn directly. However, Black can defend with b6, and the queen might become exposed.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe f4f5 is the strongest move. It gains space, attacks the bishop on g6, and can potentially open lines against Black's king. If Black captures with gxf5, White recaptures with exf5, opening the e-file. If Black retreats the bishop, White has gained space and restricted Black's pieces.\n\n```\nf4f5\n```"
