When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Roughly equal (White has R+N+B+Q vs Black's R+B+Q)\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe, Black's king has some pawn cover\n- Pawn structure: White has a passed d5 pawn which could be valuable\n- Piece activity: White's queen on g4 is active and potentially threatening\n\nLet me look for tactical opportunities:\n\n1. The Black queen on f6 and rook on f8 are on the same file as my queen on g4. Can I exploit this?\n2. My bishop on e3 and queen on g4 are aligned diagonally toward Black's kingside.\n3. The d5 pawn is advanced and could be pushed further.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **g4g6**: Queen takes pawn with check, but after Kh8, there's no immediate follow-up.\n2. **e3h6**: Bishop attacks the g7 pawn, but Black can defend with Bf8.\n3. **d5d6**: Advancing the passed pawn creates threats.\n4. **g4e6**: Queen attacks the c8 square and the e-pawn.\n5. **g4f5**: Queen attacks the e-pawn.\n\nLooking deeper at **g4e6**:\nThis move attacks the e5 pawn. If Black captures with Qxe6, I can play d5xe6 gaining material. If Black defends e5 with something like c7-c6, I can consider d5-d6 creating a strong passed pawn.\n\nLooking at **d5d6**:\nThis advances my passed pawn and threatens to push further. It also attacks the c7 pawn. Black would need to defend with c7-c6, which would weaken the b6 pawn.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the strongest move is:\n\n```\ng4e6\n```\n\nThis move attacks the e5 pawn directly, creating a material threat. If Black defends the pawn, I can follow up with d5d6 advancing my passed pawn. The queen on e6 would also control more of the board and put pressure on Black's position."
