When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King activity and position\n2. Pawn structure and potential passed pawns\n3. Potential breakthrough opportunities\n\nLet me analyze the pawn structure:\n- White has pawns on a3, b2, c3, e4, f3, g2, h3\n- Black has pawns on a6, c5, b5, e7, f6, g5, h7\n- Neither side has an immediate passed pawn\n\nLooking at potential breakthroughs:\n- On the kingside, playing f3-f4 could challenge Black's pawn structure\n- On the queenside, c3-c4 could create tension with Black's pawns\n- The e4-e5 push could gain space and challenge Black's king position\n\nKing activity is crucial in endgames. Currently, both kings are centralized, but White's king at e3 is well-positioned to support both kingside and queenside operations.\n\nLet's evaluate the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. e4e5: This gains space and puts pressure on Black's king position. It could restrict Black's king and create potential passed pawn opportunities.\n\n2. f3f4: This challenges Black's g5 pawn and could create weaknesses in Black's structure.\n\n3. c3c4: This creates tension on the queenside and could lead to favorable pawn exchanges.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe e4e5 is the strongest move. It gains space in the center, restricts Black's king, and creates the potential for a passed pawn. This move also maintains flexibility for White to operate on either side of the board.\n\n```\ne4e5\n```"
