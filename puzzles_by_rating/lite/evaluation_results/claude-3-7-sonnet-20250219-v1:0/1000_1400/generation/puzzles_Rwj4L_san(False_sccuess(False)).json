When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, two rooks, two knights, and 6 pawns. So White is up a bishop for a pawn (+2 points).\n- White has a bishop on f7 that's attacking the rook on h5 and is very close to Black's king.\n- White's rook is on g5, creating pressure.\n- Black's king is on f8 with limited mobility.\n\nThis position looks very promising for White. Let me check for immediate tactical opportunities:\n\n1. The bishop on f7 is attacking the rook on h7, but more importantly, it's next to Black's king.\n2. Looking at f7e8 or f7g8, these are checkmate moves! If the bishop moves to either e8 or g8, Black's king has no legal moves.\n\nLet me verify:\n- If Bf7-e8#: Black's king can't move to e7, g7, g8, or f7 as these squares are attacked or occupied.\n- If Bf7-g8#: Black's king can't move to e7, e8, f7, or g7 as these squares are attacked or occupied.\n\nBoth moves deliver checkmate, but I'll choose:\n\n```\nf7g8\n```"
