When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook and queen vs Black's rook and queen, but Black has an extra pawn (d3)\n- Black's queen on d3 is attacking White's position\n- White's rook on b7 is active and potentially threatening Black's king\n- White's queen on g4 has good mobility\n\nLet me check for immediate tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Checking for checkmate threats:\n   - Qg7# would be checkmate, but the f7 pawn defends that square\n   - Moving the rook to check on the 8th rank doesn't create checkmate\n\n2. Looking at the rook on b7:\n   - Rb8 attacks the rook on f8, but Black can simply capture with Rxb8\n   - Rf7 directly attacks the f7 pawn which is a key defender of Black's king\n\n3. Looking at queen moves:\n   - Qg7 is defended by the f7 pawn\n   - Qg6 threatens the h6 pawn and puts pressure on Black's king position\n\nThe move Rf7 (b7f7) looks very strong because:\n- It attacks the f7 pawn which is crucial for Black's king safety\n- If Black captures with gxf7+, White has Qxf7# as a response\n- If Black doesn't capture, White wins a pawn and maintains the attack\n\nLet's double-check this line:\n- After b7f7, if Black plays gxf7+, White plays Qxf7#\n- If Black doesn't capture and plays something like Rf7, White can play Qxf7#\n- If Black plays something else, White has won a pawn and maintains a strong attack\n\nThis is a decisive tactical blow that should win the game immediately.\n\n```\nb7f7\n```"
