When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, rook, and 3 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is exposed on c5, while White's king is on g1.\n- Piece activity: Black's pieces are active, with the knight on d5 and rook on f5.\n\nLet me evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. **c5d6** (King move): This moves the king away from the center, which is generally not good in the endgame. It also abandons protection of the c4 pawn.\n\n2. **c5b5** (King move): This keeps the king more centralized but still abandons the c4 pawn.\n\n3. **c5b4** (King move): This moves the king toward the queenside but again leaves the c4 pawn unprotected.\n\n4. **b6c7** (Queen move): This retreats the queen and loses activity.\n\n5. **b6c6** (Queen move): This keeps the queen active and protects the king from potential checks.\n\n6. **d5c7** (Knight move): This moves the knight away from its strong central position.\n\nLooking at the position more deeply, I notice that Black's king is quite exposed. The priority should be to improve king safety while maintaining piece coordination.\n\nThe move **b6c6** stands out as it:\n- Protects the king from potential checks\n- Maintains queen activity\n- Keeps control of important squares\n- Doesn't abandon any pawns\n\nThis move allows Black to maintain pressure while improving the king's safety. The queen on c6 works well with the knight on d5 and rook on f5, creating a harmonious piece setup.\n\n```\nb6c6\n```"
