Material count: Roughly equal (Q+R+N vs Q+R+B)\n2. King safety: My king is under severe pressure with Black's queen on f2\n3. Piece activity: Black's pieces are actively positioned for an attack\n4. Threats: Black is threatening checkmate with Qf1#\n\nSince I only have one legal move (g1h1), I need to understand why this is the case. Looking at the position, Black's queen on f2 is directly threatening checkmate on f1. My only option is to move my king out of the way.\n\nAfter g1h1, Black will likely continue the attack. The position remains extremely difficult for White as Black can follow up with moves like Qf1+ or Rf1+ leading to checkmate soon.\n\nGiven that I have only one legal move, I must play:\n\n```\ng1h1\n```"
