When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position step by step to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Equal (Queen, Rook, Rook vs Queen, Rook, Rook)\n- White has a knight on g5 and Black has a knight on f5\n- White's king is safer than Black's king\n- White has an advanced e-pawn on e5\n- Black's king is on g8 with limited protection\n\nLooking at the position, I notice White's knight on g5 is in a powerful position and can potentially attack Black's king. Let me explore tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Knight moves:\n   - g5h7: Knight fork attacking the king and rook on g6\n   - g5f7: Knight check, attacking the king and pawn\n   - Other knight moves seem less threatening\n\n2. Queen moves:\n   - d2f4: Queen attacks the knight on f5\n   - d2a5: Queen attacks the a-pawn\n   - Other queen moves don't seem to create immediate threats\n\n3. Rook moves:\n   - No immediate threats with rook moves\n\nThe move g5h7 stands out as it creates a knight fork attacking both the king and rook. This would win material as Black's king must move, allowing White to capture the rook on g6.\n\nLet's verify this tactic:\n- After Nh7, Black's king must move (likely to h8)\n- Then White can capture the rook on g6\n- This would give White a significant material advantage\n\nThe move g5f7 is also a check but after the king moves, the knight would be hanging.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5h7\n```"
