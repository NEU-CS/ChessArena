When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I need to analyze this position carefully as Black. Let me assess the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, let me understand the material situation:\n- White has a queen, rook, knight, bishop, and several pawns\n- Black has a queen, rook, knight, and several pawns\n- Material is roughly equal, but the position is complex\n\nKey observations:\n1. My king (Black) is on h8 with a White queen on f8 directly adjacent - this is extremely dangerous\n2. I have a rook on b2 that's attacking White's c2 pawn\n3. My queen on a5 is active but not immediately threatening anything decisive\n4. My knight on e5 is well-positioned\n\nThe most urgent issue is my king's safety. With White's queen on f8 next to my king, I'm in serious danger. Looking at the legal moves, I notice e5f7 (knight to f7) would block the queen's attack and protect my king.\n\nAnother critical observation: my rook on b2 is attacking White's king on e2. If I can deliver check with my queen or knight, that could be decisive.\n\nLet me check knight moves:\n- e5f3+ would be check, attacking White's king directly\n- e5d3 threatens the bishop but isn't check\n- e5g4 doesn't seem particularly strong\n\nLet me check queen moves:\n- a5c3 would capture White's knight\n- a5a2 would capture White's pawn and threaten the rook\n\nThe most forcing move appears to be e5f3+, delivering check to White's king. This forces White to respond to the check, and after the king moves, I can potentially follow up with queen or rook moves to increase the pressure.\n\n```\ne5f3\n```"
