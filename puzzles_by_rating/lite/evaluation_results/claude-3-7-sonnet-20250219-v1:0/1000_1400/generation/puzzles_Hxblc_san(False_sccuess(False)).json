When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

So Black has a material advantage.\n- King safety: Black's king on g7 is relatively safe with pawn protection. White's king on c1 is exposed.\n- Pawn structure: Black has several pawns that could become threats.\n- Piece activity: Black's queen on g5 is active, and the knight on g4 is well-positioned.\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **g4e3**: Knight fork attacking White's queen and rook. This would win material immediately.\n2. **g5f4**: Queen move that controls important squares.\n3. **g4f2**: Knight attacking White's c-pawn.\n4. **g5h4**: Queen move that maintains pressure.\n\nLooking at g4e3 more closely, this knight move creates a fork between White's queen on f3 and rook on g1. White would have to move the queen, allowing Black to capture the rook. This is a clear material gain.\n\nLet's check if there are any better options or tactical opportunities I might have missed:\n- No immediate checkmate threats\n- No better material-winning moves than the knight fork\n- No immediate threats from White that need addressing\n\nThe knight fork on e3 is clearly the strongest move, winning a rook for free.\n\n```\ng4e3\n```"
