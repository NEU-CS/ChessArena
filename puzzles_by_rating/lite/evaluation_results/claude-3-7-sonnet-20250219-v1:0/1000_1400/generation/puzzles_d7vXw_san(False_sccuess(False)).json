When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Roughly equal (Queen, Rook, Rook vs Queen, Rook, Rook)\n- King safety: White's king is exposed with Black's queen on g3 threatening checkmate\n- Piece activity: Black has active rooks on d5 and h5, putting pressure on White\n\nThe most urgent issue is that Black's queen on g3 is threatening checkmate on h2. This is an immediate threat that must be addressed.\n\nLooking at defensive options:\n1. Block with the queen: e2e3 would block the g3-h2 diagonal\n2. Move the king: h1g1 would escape the diagonal\n3. Capture the queen: Not possible directly\n\nLet me check if Black has other immediate threats:\n- The rook on h5 is targeting h3, but that's protected\n- The rook on d5 isn't creating immediate threats\n\nSince the queen threat is most critical, I need to address it immediately. The two main candidates are e2e3 and h1g1.\n\nIf I play e2e3, it blocks the check threat but leaves my queen somewhat passively placed. Black might continue pressure with moves like Rh4 increasing the attack.\n\nIf I play h1g1, I escape the diagonal, but need to ensure there are no other immediate threats. After h1g1, the g2 pawn would be protected by the king, and the f1 rook protects f2.\n\nBetween these two options, h1g1 seems more flexible as it maintains the queen's activity while addressing the immediate threat.\n\nLet me double-check for any tactical opportunities I might have missed:\n- No immediate checkmate threats for White\n- No immediate captures that win material\n\nAfter careful consideration, moving the king to g1 is the safest and most flexible defensive move.\n\n```\nh1g1\n```"
