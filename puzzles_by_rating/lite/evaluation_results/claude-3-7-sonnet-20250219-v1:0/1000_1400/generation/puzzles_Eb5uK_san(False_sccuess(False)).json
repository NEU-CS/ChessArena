When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, rook, and 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king on f2 is somewhat exposed. Black's king on g8 is safer.\n- Threats: Black's queen on a2 and rook on c2 are threatening White's position.\n\nThe most pressing issue is that Black's rook on c2 is threatening White's bishop on e2, and the queen on a2 is also applying pressure. I need to address these immediate threats.\n\nLooking at potential moves:\n1. Checkmate opportunities: The queen on e5 can deliver checkmate with Qe8# or Qh8#\n2. Defensive moves: I could move the bishop away from c2's attack\n3. Counter-attacking moves: I could attack Black's king\n\nLet me check the checkmate possibilities:\n- Qe8# (e5e8): This is checkmate as the Black king has no escape squares\n- Qh8# (e5h8): This is also checkmate\n\nBoth e5e8 and e5h8 deliver immediate checkmate. Since I have a forced win, there's no need to consider other options.\n\nBetween the two checkmate moves, either one works perfectly. I'll choose:\n\n```\ne5e8\n```"
