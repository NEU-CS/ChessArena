When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has two rooks, a queen, and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen on f2 is very threatening.\n- King safety: White's king on c1 is exposed, and Black's queen on f2 is dangerously close.\n- Threats: Black's queen on f2 is threatening checkmate on c2 or capturing on c2 with check.\n- Black's rooks on e7 and e8 are well-positioned.\n\nThe most urgent issue is the Black queen on f2 threatening checkmate. I need to address this immediately.\n\nLet's consider candidate moves:\n1. **c4g8#** - This appears to be checkmate! The queen moves to g8, and Black's king on h8 has no escape squares.\n2. **c4f7** - This would attack the rook on e7, but doesn't address the immediate threat.\n3. **d1d2** - Blocks the queen's attack on c2, but allows Qxd2+ followed by mate.\n\nLooking at c4g8 more carefully:\n- The queen moves from c4 to g8\n- Black's king is on h8\n- The king can't move to h7 (blocked by own pawn)\n- Can't move to g8 (where our queen would be)\n- Can't block with any piece\n- Can't capture the queen\n\nThis is indeed checkmate in one move!\n\n```\nc4g8\n```"
