When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: My king on e1 is somewhat exposed, while Black's king is on c8.\n- Piece activity: My knight on h8 is oddly placed but could be threatening.\n- Pawn structure: I have a passed d-pawn which could be valuable.\n\nLet me examine some candidate moves:\n\n1. **h8f7**: Moving my knight to f7 would attack Black's king and rook simultaneously, creating a fork. This looks very strong.\n\n2. **b1b7**: Attacking the pawn on b7, but after Black defends with the rook, I don't see a clear follow-up.\n\n3. **d2h6**: Moving the bishop to attack the g7 pawn, but this doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n\n4. **g2f3**: Capturing Black's knight on g3 would eliminate a piece that's infiltrated my position.\n\nLooking more deeply at h8f7:\n- It creates a knight fork on the king and rook\n- Black would have to move the king, allowing me to capture the rook\n- This would give me a significant material advantage\n\nThe knight fork on f7 is clearly the strongest move, as it wins material by force. Black will have to move the king, and I'll capture the rook on d8.\n\n```\nh8f7\n```"
