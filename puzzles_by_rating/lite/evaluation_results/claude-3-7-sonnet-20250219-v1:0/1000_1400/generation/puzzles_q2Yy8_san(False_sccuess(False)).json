When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: White has a knight, bishop, and two queens vs Black's two bishops and a queen. Material is roughly equal.\n- Position: White's knight on c6 is active and potentially threatening. Black's king on g8 seems somewhat exposed.\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have relatively intact pawn structures.\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. Knight moves from c6:\n   - c6d8 would attack the black queen on c7, but the knight would be captured\n   - c6e7 would fork the king and queen, a very strong tactical move\n   - Other knight moves seem less impactful\n\n2. Bishop moves from e2:\n   - e2h5 could create some pressure on the kingside\n   - e2g4 might prepare an attack on the kingside\n\n3. Queen moves from c2:\n   - c2g6 directly attacks a pawn near Black's king\n   - c2f5 could create pressure on the kingside\n   - c2e4 could attack the d5 pawn\n\nThe move c6e7 stands out immediately as it forks Black's king and queen. This would either win the queen or force the king to move, potentially leading to a strong attack.\n\nLet's verify this move: Knight from c6 to e7 forks the king on g8 and queen on c7. Black would have to move the king, allowing White to capture the queen on the next move, gaining a significant material advantage.\n\nThis is clearly the strongest move in the position.\n\n```\nc6e7\n```"
