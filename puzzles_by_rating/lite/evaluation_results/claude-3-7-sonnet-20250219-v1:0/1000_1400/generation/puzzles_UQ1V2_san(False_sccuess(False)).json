When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Knight moves: The e5 knight could deliver a fork with e5f7, attacking both the king and queen.\n2. Queen moves: My queen on g3 could potentially create threats.\n3. Bishop moves: The bishop on b5 could retreat or capture.\n\nLet's analyze the most promising candidates:\n\n**e5f7**: This knight move forks Black's king and queen. After Kxf7, I'd lose the knight but capture the queen with Qxe7+, gaining a queen for a knight - excellent trade.\n\n**g3g7**: This queen move threatens mate, but Black can block with Qf7, though this would lose the queen to my knight on e5.\n\n**b5c6**: This bishop move attacks the black pawn on b7, but doesn't seem as strong as the other options.\n\nThe knight fork on f7 stands out as clearly the best move. It creates an immediate material-winning threat that Black cannot adequately defend against.\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
