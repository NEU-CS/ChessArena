When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is in the center (e8) and hasn't castled yet. White's king is on e2.\n- Black's queen on h4 is active and potentially threatening.\n- Black still has the option to castle kingside (k in FEN notation).\n\nLet me consider the key candidate moves:\n\n1. **Castling (e8g8)**: This would improve king safety immediately.\n2. **Queen moves**: The queen on h4 is active and could create threats.\n3. **Bishop moves**: The bishop on c8 is undeveloped.\n\nLooking at specific tactical opportunities:\n- The queen on h4 is attacking g3, but it's protected.\n- If I could create a discovered attack with the bishop on c8, that might be powerful.\n\nThe most pressing need seems to be king safety. Castling kingside (e8g8) would immediately improve my position by connecting the rooks and getting the king to safety.\n\nLet's check if there are any immediate tactical opportunities with the queen:\n- h4h2 threatens the g2 pawn but White can defend with Qd1-d2.\n- h4g3 would just exchange pawns, not gaining much.\n- h4e4 attacks the c4 pawn but White can defend it.\n\nNo immediate winning tactics, so the strategic priority of king safety through castling seems best.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
