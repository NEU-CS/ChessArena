When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The kings are relatively close, with White's king more exposed\n2. Black's d4 pawn is advanced and potentially dangerous\n3. The rooks are active, with Black's rook controlling the 7th rank\n\nLet me evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. d4d3: This advances our passed pawn, which is a strong asset. This pawn could become a serious promotion threat.\n\n2. h5h4+: This gives a check and pushes a pawn forward, potentially creating a passed pawn on the h-file.\n\n3. Rook moves (f7f8, f7h7, etc.): Need to determine the best square for the rook. The 7th rank is generally strong, but maybe there's a better square.\n\n4. King moves (f6g7, f6g6): The king should stay centralized or move toward the action.\n\n5. Other pawn moves (a7a6, a7a5, b6b5): These don't seem to address immediate threats or create immediate threats.\n\nThe most forcing and potentially strongest moves are d4d3 and h5h4+.\n\nWith d4d3, we advance our passed pawn, which White must deal with. If White captures with the rook, we can play Rf2+ winning the rook.\n\nWith h5h4+, we give check, but after Kg4 or Kh3, it's not clear what we've gained.\n\nI believe advancing the passed d-pawn is the most principled approach, creating a concrete threat that White must address immediately.\n\n```\nd4d3\n```"
