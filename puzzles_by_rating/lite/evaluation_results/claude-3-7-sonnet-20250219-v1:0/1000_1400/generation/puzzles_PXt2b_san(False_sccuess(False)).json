When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's king is exposed on f5\n2. Black's knight on e5 is defending the g-pawn\n3. White's rook on d6 is active and has multiple possible moves\n4. Black's d4 pawn is advanced and potentially dangerous\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- I should consider attacking the black king directly with the rook\n- I should evaluate if I can win material\n- I need to prevent any knight forks or threats\n\nThe move Rd6-f6+ looks very strong as it checks the king and forces it to move. Let me see if it's in the legal moves list... Yes, it's there as \"d6f6\".\n\nIf I play Rf6+, Black's king must move. The king can go to:\n- e4: Then I can play Rf4+ winning the d4 pawn\n- g4: Then I can play Rf4+ winning the d4 pawn\n- e5: Then I can capture the knight with Rxe5+\n- g6: Then I can play Rf4 threatening the d4 pawn\n\nThis move creates immediate threats and puts pressure on Black's position. It's a forcing move that gives White a clear advantage.\n\n```\nd6f6\n```"
