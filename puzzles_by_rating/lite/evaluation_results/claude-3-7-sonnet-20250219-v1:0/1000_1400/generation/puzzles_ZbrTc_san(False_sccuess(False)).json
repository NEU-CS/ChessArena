When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Moving to e4 (d6e4) could be interesting to attack White's position.\n\n2. **Bishop moves**: The bishop on b7 is currently on a good diagonal. Moving to d5 (b7d5) would capture White's advanced pawn.\n\n3. **Pawn advances**: Advancing pawns like f7f5 could gain space and prepare for counterplay.\n\n4. **Rook activation**: Moving the a8 rook to an open file could improve piece activity.\n\nLooking more deeply at b7d5 (capturing the d5 pawn):\n- This would win a pawn\n- After White recaptures, we'd likely trade pieces and simplify\n- This seems like a clear material gain with no obvious drawbacks\n\nLet me check if there are any tactical issues with b7d5:\n- White's bishop on f4 doesn't defend d5\n- White's knight on f3 doesn't defend d5\n- No immediate threats after capturing\n\nThe move b7d5 (capturing White's advanced pawn) appears to be the strongest move, gaining material without apparent drawbacks.\n\n```\nb7d5\n```"
