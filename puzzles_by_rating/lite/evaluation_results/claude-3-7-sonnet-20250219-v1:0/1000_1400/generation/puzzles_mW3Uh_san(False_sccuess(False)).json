When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, bishop, and 2 pawns. So White is up by 2 pawns.\n- King safety: White's king is on g1, relatively safe. Black's king is on h6, somewhat exposed.\n- Piece activity: White's rook is active on c5, bishop on b2 controls the long diagonal.\n- Threats: Black's rook on d8 and bishop on b1 are active pieces.\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **c5c8**: Trading rooks would simplify to a winning endgame with our material advantage.\n2. **b2h8**: Bishop check, forcing the black king to move.\n3. **b5b6**: Advancing the passed pawn, which could be a strong winning plan.\n4. **c5h5**: Rook check, forcing the king to g7 or g6.\n\nAnalyzing these options:\n\n**c5c8** exchanges rooks, leaving us with a bishop vs bishop endgame with a 2-pawn advantage. This should be winning for White.\n\n**b2h8** gives a check but after the king moves to g5, there's no immediate follow-up.\n\n**b5b6** advances our passed pawn, which is a strong asset. The pawn could become a promotion threat.\n\n**c5h5+** forces Kg7, but doesn't seem to lead to immediate tactical gains.\n\nThe simplest winning plan appears to be trading rooks and converting our material advantage. With the rooks off the board, our passed b-pawn becomes very dangerous.\n\n```\nc5c8\n```"
