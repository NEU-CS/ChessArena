When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

However, I need to check if this creates any threats or escapes any threats.\n\nThe g6 pawn would still block my king's escape route. My king would be on h6, which is still in the corner of the board with limited mobility. The white queen on f5 could still control squares around my king.\n\n**Option 2: h5h4 (King moves from h5 to h4)**\nIf I move my king to h4, I would be moving closer to the edge of the board. I need to check if this exposes me to any checks or threats.\n\nThe white queen on f5 doesn't directly attack h4. The f4 pawn provides some protection for my king. Moving to h4 might give me slightly more breathing room.\n\nLet me check if either move allows me to set up any threats with my queen on d2 or rook on b8.\n\nAfter careful analysis, h5h4 seems slightly better as it moves my king to a square not directly threatened by White's queen while maintaining connection with my f4 pawn. The h6 square is more restricted due to the g6 pawn.\n\n```\nh5h4\n```"
