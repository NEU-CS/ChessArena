When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me consider tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Knight moves that could lead to checkmate threats:\n   - e6f8 would capture the rook with check\n   - e6g7 would fork the king and potentially set up mate\n\n2. Queen moves that could lead to immediate threats:\n   - d5h5 could threaten mate along the h-file\n   - d5g5 could threaten mate with support from the knight\n\nLet me analyze the most promising candidates:\n\ne6f8: Captures rook with check, but after Kh7, Black's king escapes.\n\ne6g7: Knight fork of king and pawn. If Kg8, I can follow with Qg5+ and mate soon follows.\n\nd5h5: Threatens mate on h7/h8, but Black can block with g6.\n\nLooking deeper at e6g7:\nIf e6g7, Kg8, then Qg5+ forces Kf7, and I can follow with Qg7+ and Qf8#.\n\nThis is a decisive attack, so my final move is:\n\n```\ne6g7\n```"
