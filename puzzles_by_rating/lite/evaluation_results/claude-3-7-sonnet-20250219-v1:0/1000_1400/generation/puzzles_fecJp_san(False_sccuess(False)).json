When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This is an immediate threat that must be addressed.\n\nLet's examine each legal move:\n1. e7e8 - King moves to e8, still in check from the knight on g6\n2. e7f7 - King moves to f7, still in check from the knight on g6\n3. e7d7 - King moves to d7, escaping check\n4. e7e6 - King moves to e6, still in check from the knight on g6\n5. e7d6 - King moves to d6, escaping check\n6. h7g6 - Pawn captures knight, removing the immediate threat\n\nThe moves e7e8, e7f7, and e7e6 are all illegal as they don't get out of check from the knight.\n\nBetween the remaining options (e7d7, e7d6, and h7g6):\n- h7g6 captures the knight but leaves the king exposed to the queen on h5\n- e7d7 moves the king to safety but might allow White to continue the attack\n- e7d6 moves the king to safety but might be more exposed\n\nAfter h7g6, White can play Qh7+ followed by Qg7#, so this is losing.\n\nBetween e7d7 and e7d6, d7 seems safer as it keeps the king closer to the kingside pieces and further from White's bishop on c4.\n\n```\ne7d7\n```"
