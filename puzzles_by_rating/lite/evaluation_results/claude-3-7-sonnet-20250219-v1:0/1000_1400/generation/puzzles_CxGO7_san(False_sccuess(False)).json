When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a queen, knight, rook, and several pawns. White has a queen, rook, and pawns.\n- King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7, while White's king is in the corner on h1.\n- Pawn structure: Black has passed pawns on the queenside that could be valuable.\n\nLet me check for immediate threats:\n- White's queen on e6 is attacking the g6 pawn and controlling squares around Black's king.\n- White's rook on c1 is on an open file.\n\nLet's consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves (c6)**:\n   - Moving the knight could develop an attack or defend key squares.\n   - c6e5 looks interesting as it attacks White's queen.\n\n2. **Queen moves (b6)**:\n   - The queen is well-positioned but could potentially find a better square.\n   - b6c7 could protect the king from the side.\n\n3. **Rook moves (h5)**:\n   - h5e5 could attack White's queen.\n   - h5h8 might prepare for activity on the back rank.\n\n4. **King moves**:\n   - Moving the king to safety might be prudent given White's queen proximity.\n\n5. **Pawn advances**:\n   - a4a3 continues pushing the passed pawn.\n   - g6g5 challenges White's pawn structure.\n\nAfter analyzing the position, I believe the most promising move is c6e5. This knight move attacks White's queen on e6, forcing it to move and relieving pressure on Black's position. If White's queen retreats, Black can continue advancing the queenside pawns which are quite dangerous.\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
