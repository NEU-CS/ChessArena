When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I have only two legal moves, which means I'm in a very constrained position.\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\nOption 1: f2f3\nThis would attack the knight on e4, forcing it to move. However, after I move my king to f3, Black's queen on a1 would have a clear diagonal attack on my king via a1-f6. This would be checkmate as I have no way to block or capture the queen. So f2f3 leads to immediate checkmate.\n\nOption 2: f2e2\nMoving my king to e2 evades the knight's attack. The knight on e4 would still be threatening squares around my king, but there's no immediate checkmate. My queen on h6 and rook on g2 remain active, and I can continue the game.\n\nSince f2f3 leads to immediate checkmate by Black's queen, while f2e2 allows me to continue the game, the choice is clear.\n\n```\nf2e2\n```"
