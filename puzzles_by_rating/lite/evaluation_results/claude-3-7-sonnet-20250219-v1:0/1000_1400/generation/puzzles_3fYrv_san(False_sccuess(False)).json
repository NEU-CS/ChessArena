When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This eliminates the threat to my bishop but allows Black to recapture with the pawn, opening the e-file for Black's rooks.\n\n2. **e4d5**: Moving the bishop to safety while maintaining pressure on the queenside.\n\n3. **c1c8**: Trading rooks, which might be advantageous if I'm ahead in material or position.\n\n4. **d2d4**: Attacking the knight with the queen, but this leaves my queen vulnerable to capture.\n\n5. **a3b4**: Capturing the knight on b4 with the bishop.\n\nLooking deeper at **a3b4**, this seems particularly strong. It captures a knight immediately, and after Black recaptures (likely with the a-pawn), I'll have created a passed a-pawn. This would give me a significant advantage.\n\nThe knight on d4 is threatening my bishop, but I can address that next move. Capturing the knight on b4 first creates an immediate material advantage.\n\nAfter analyzing all options, I believe capturing the knight on b4 is the strongest move:\n\n```\na3b4\n```"
