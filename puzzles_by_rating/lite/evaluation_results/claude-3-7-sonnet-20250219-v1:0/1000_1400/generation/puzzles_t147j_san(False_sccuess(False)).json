When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I need to determine if I can stop this threat while maintaining or improving my position.\n\nLet's consider candidate moves:\n1. Rook moves (d7d8, d7f7, d7e7, d7c7, d7b7, d7d6, d7d5, d7d4, d7d3, d7d2, d7d1)\n2. King moves (b1c1, b1a1)\n3. Pawn moves (f4f5, c2c3, b2b3, a2a3, c2c4, b2b4, a2a4)\n\nThe g3 pawn is a critical threat. Can I stop it from promoting? I need to either capture it or promote my own pawn faster.\n\nLooking at the rook moves, d7f7 looks very strong as it attacks Black's bishop on g7 while maintaining control of the 7th rank. This would force Black to either move the bishop or defend it, giving me time to address the g3 pawn.\n\nAfter d7f7, if Black moves the bishop, I could potentially play a move like c2c3 to slow down the g3 pawn's advance.\n\nAnother strong option is d7d1, which prepares to capture the g3 pawn after it promotes. However, this is risky as Black might have tactical resources.\n\nGiven the critical nature of the position and the threat of Black's g3 pawn, I believe the most active and strongest move is to attack Black's bishop with the rook.\n\n```\nd7f7\n```"
