If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let me understand the position:\n- Material: Black has a bishop pair (on g3 and c7) and a king on d7, while White has a bishop on e2 and king on g5\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have several pawns, with Black having an advanced e3 pawn\n- King safety: White's king is quite active on g5\n\nLet me evaluate the legal moves:\n\n1. King moves (d7e8, d7c8): \n   - Moving the king doesn't seem urgent as it's not under immediate threat\n\n2. Bishop moves from c7 (c7d8, c7c8, c7b8, c7b7):\n   - These are mostly passive repositioning moves\n\n3. Bishop moves from g3:\n   - g3e5: Interesting - attacks White's e-pawn but could be captured\n   - g3h4+: Gives a check but king can simply move\n   - g3f4: Attacks White's g-pawn\n   - g3h2: Retreats to a less active position\n   - g3f2: Retreats to a less active position\n   - g3e1: Retreats to a less active position\n\n4. Pawn move:\n   - a6a5: Advances the a-pawn\n\nLooking at the position more deeply, I notice Black's e3 pawn is quite advanced and potentially dangerous. The bishop on g3 is also very active and could support this pawn's promotion.\n\nThe most promising move seems to be g3f4, attacking White's g-pawn. If White captures with the king (Kxf4), Black can push e3-e2 with promotion threats. If White defends the g-pawn, Black maintains pressure.\n\nLet me check if there are any tactical opportunities I'm missing... The move g3e5 looks tactically interesting as it attacks White's e-pawn, but White can capture it with the bishop.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the most active and promising move is:\n\n```\ng3f4\n```"
