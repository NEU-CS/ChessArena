When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, a bishop, a knight, and 7 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- White's knight on c7 is attacking Black's queen on d8.\n- White's bishop on a6 is pinning Black's b7 pawn to the rook on a7.\n- Black's knight on d4 is threatening White's queen on c3.\n\nKey tactical opportunities:\n1. Knight fork with c7e8 would attack Black's king and rook simultaneously.\n2. Capturing the queen with c7d8 isn't in the legal moves list, suggesting the queen is protected.\n3. White's queen is under attack by Black's knight on d4.\n\nLet me analyze the most promising moves:\n\n1. **c7e8**: Knight fork attacking king and rook. This is very strong as it would win material.\n\n2. **c3d4**: Capturing the knight that's threatening the queen. This eliminates the immediate threat.\n\n3. **a6b7**: Capturing the pawn with the bishop, attacking the rook.\n\nThe knight fork c7e8 looks most promising as it creates a decisive tactical advantage. After c7e8+, Black must move the king, allowing White to capture the rook on a7 next move.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the best move is:\n\n```\nc7e8\n```\n\nThis knight fork creates an immediate winning advantage by attacking both the king and rook simultaneously."
