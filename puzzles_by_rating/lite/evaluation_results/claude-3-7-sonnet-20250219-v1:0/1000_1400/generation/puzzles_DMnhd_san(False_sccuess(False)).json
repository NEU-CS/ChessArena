When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black could advance the b-pawn while White's king is occupied on the kingside.\n\n**Option 2: f5f6 (King captures f6 pawn)**\nSimilar to the first option, this captures a Black pawn but leaves White's king far from the queenside. Black could play d4e4 attacking White's e-pawn, and White would struggle to defend both sides of the board.\n\n**Option 3: f5e6 (King moves to e6)**\nThis move doesn't capture anything immediately but maintains control of more squares. It prevents Black's king from advancing to e5 and stays more centralized. From e6, White's king can potentially move toward the queenside if needed or continue pressure on Black's kingside pawns.\n\nThe key insight is that in endgames, king activity and centralization are often more important than capturing pawns immediately. By moving to e6, White's king maintains flexibility and can respond to Black's plans more effectively.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the best move is:\n\n```\nf5e6\n```"
