Black has a queen and rook.\n- King safety: White's king is on h3, Black's king is on d6.\n- Threats: Black's queen on f2 and rook on e3 are potentially threatening.\n\nLet me check for immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on f2 is threatening White's king, but not delivering check.\n- Black's rook on e3 is also threatening but not checking.\n\nLet me consider my options:\n1. Queen moves: I have many queen moves available from g7.\n2. Pawn advances: g4g5, c4c5, b3b4 are available.\n\nLooking for winning tactics:\n- Can I checkmate Black's king? The king is on d6.\n- Queen moves to e5 would be check, but Black can capture with the rook.\n- Queen to f6 would be check, and Black's king has limited escape squares.\n\nLet me analyze Qg7f6:\n- This delivers check to the king on d6.\n- Black's king can only move to c5, d7, or e6.\n- If king moves to c5, I can play Qf6c6 checkmate.\n- If king moves to d7, I can play Qf6e7 checkmate.\n- If king moves to e6, I can play Qf6e5 checkmate.\n\nThis is a forced checkmate sequence! The queen move to f6 forces Black's king into a mating net regardless of where it moves.\n\n```\ng7f6\n```"
