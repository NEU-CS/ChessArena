When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The knight on d4 is a threat that needs to be addressed\n2. White's king safety is a concern\n3. Development and piece coordination need improvement\n\nLet's analyze the candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves (c3d5, c3b5, c3e4, etc.)**: \n   - c3d5 would trade knights, but Black's bishop on c5 would recapture, increasing Black's central control\n   - c3e4 would be a blunder as the knight would be undefended\n   - Other knight moves don't improve White's position significantly\n\n2. **Queen moves (f2h4, f2d4, etc.)**:\n   - f2d4 would capture the knight, but after Bxd4, White loses material\n   - Other queen moves don't address immediate threats\n\n3. **King moves (e1d2, e1d1)**:\n   - These improve king safety somewhat but don't address the knight threat\n\n4. **Bishop development (f1e2, c1e3, c1d2)**:\n   - f1e2 develops a piece but doesn't address immediate threats\n   - c1e3 would be met with Bxe3, forcing exchanges\n   - c1d2 blocks the queen's defense of d4\n\n5. **Castling (h1g1)**:\n   - This improves king safety significantly\n\nLooking at the position more deeply, I notice that the knight on d4 isn't actually threatening anything immediate. The most pressing need is to improve White's king safety and piece coordination.\n\nCastling kingside with h1g1 accomplishes this goal while preparing to contest the center in subsequent moves. This gets the king to safety and connects the rooks.\n\n```\nh1g1\n```"
