When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, a knight, and 8 pawns. Black has a queen, two rooks, two knights, a bishop, and 7 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is in the center and hasn't castled yet. Black's king is also in the center.\n- Pawn structure: White has a pawn on g4 that's attacking Black's e-pawn.\n- Piece activity: White has active bishops on g2 and f4.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. White can castle kingside with e1g1, which would improve king safety.\n2. The bishop on f4 is attacking the e5 pawn.\n3. White's queen on b3 is active and could potentially create threats.\n\nLet's analyze the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. e1g1 (Castling kingside):\n   - Improves king safety immediately\n   - Connects the rooks\n   - Standard development move that should be prioritized\n\n2. f4e5 (Bishop takes pawn):\n   - Wins a pawn\n   - But after Black recaptures, White loses the bishop or must retreat\n\n3. b3b7 (Queen attacks Black's b7 pawn):\n   - Creates immediate pressure\n   - But could be risky as the queen might get trapped\n\n4. g2e4 (Bishop to e4):\n   - Controls central squares\n   - Creates pressure on Black's position\n\nAfter careful consideration, castling (e1g1) seems most urgent as it addresses king safety while Black's king is also in the center. This allows White to potentially launch an attack afterward with better piece coordination.\n\n```\ne1g1\n```"
