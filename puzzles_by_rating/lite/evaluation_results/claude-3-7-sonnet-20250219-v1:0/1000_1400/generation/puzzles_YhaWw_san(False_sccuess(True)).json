When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let's analyze each legal move:\n\n1. **a6a7**: Moving the king up\n   - This move retreats the king away from the white queen on c6\n   - However, it restricts the king's mobility, potentially trapping it\n   - The white queen can still control squares around the king\n\n2. **a6a5**: Moving the king down\n   - This move keeps the king closer to the b5 pawn for protection\n   - It gives the king more escape squares\n   - It moves away from the white queen's immediate attack range\n\n3. **b7b6**: Moving the rook to b6\n   - This blocks the white queen's direct attack on the king\n   - Creates a defensive barrier between the king and white queen\n   - Maintains control of the 7th rank\n\nThe most critical factor here is the safety of the black king, which is under pressure from the white queen on c6.\n\nMoving the rook to b6 (b7b6) seems strongest as it directly blocks the white queen's attack and creates a defensive barrier. This move addresses the immediate threat while maintaining the rook's activity.\n\nThe king moves don't address the immediate pressure as effectively. Moving to a7 could potentially trap the king, while a5 is better but doesn't directly counter the queen's threat.\n\n```\nb7b6\n```"
