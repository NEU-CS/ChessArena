When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Equal (rook vs rook)\n- King positions: White king on g3, Black king on f6\n- Pawn structure: White has pawns on d4, f3, f2, h2; Black has pawns on f7, g7, h6, and a rook on e6\n- White's rook is active on b4\n\nKey considerations:\n1. White's rook is active and could potentially attack Black's 7th rank\n2. The d4 pawn could advance to create a passed pawn\n3. King activity could be important in this endgame\n\nLet me evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. **b4b7** - Attacking the 7th rank, threatening Black's pawns\n   This puts immediate pressure on Black's position and forces a defensive stance.\n\n2. **d4d5** - Advancing the passed pawn\n   This creates a potential distraction for Black's rook and could become dangerous.\n\n3. **g3f4** - Activating the king\n   Moving the king closer to the center could help in the endgame.\n\nAnalyzing b4b7:\nIf White plays Rb7, Black's rook is tied to defending the f7 pawn. This restricts Black's rook mobility significantly. White can then gradually improve the position with king moves or pawn advances.\n\nAnalyzing d4d5:\nThis creates a passed pawn that Black must watch. However, Black can easily block it with Re6-d6, so the immediate impact is limited.\n\nAnalyzing g3f4:\nThis improves king centralization but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the most forcing and strongest move is to attack the 7th rank with the rook:\n\n```\nb4b7\n```\n\nThis move puts immediate pressure on Black's pawns, restricts the enemy rook's mobility, and creates concrete threats that Black must respond to. It's the most active and forcing option available."
