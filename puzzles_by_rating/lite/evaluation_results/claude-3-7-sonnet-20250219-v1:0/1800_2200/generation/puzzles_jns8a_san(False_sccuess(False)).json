When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, a knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- White's bishop is on d7, directly attacking Black's king position.\n- Black's queen on d4 is active and potentially threatening.\n- Black's king is on c7 and somewhat exposed.\n\nLet me consider the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **Queen moves**:\n   - The queen on d4 has many options and is currently very active.\n   - `d4c3` would capture White's knight, winning material.\n   - `d4f2` could attack White's pawn and potentially create threats.\n   - `d4a7` could attack White's pawn on a7.\n\n2. **Rook moves**:\n   - The rooks aren't immediately threatening anything significant.\n\n3. **Bishop moves**:\n   - The bishop on f6 could move to e7 to block the check from White's bishop.\n\nLet's analyze the most promising options:\n\n**d4c3** (capturing the knight):\nThis wins a piece immediately. After Qxc3, White has no immediate compensation. This is a clear material gain.\n\n**d4f2**:\nThis attacks White's pawn but doesn't win material immediately as White can defend.\n\n**f6e7**:\nThis blocks the check from White's bishop but doesn't gain material.\n\nAfter careful analysis, capturing the knight with the queen is clearly the strongest move. It wins material without any apparent drawbacks or counterplay for White.\n\n```\nd4c3\n```"
