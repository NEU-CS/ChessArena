When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material is roughly equal\n- White has a bishop on h6 attacking the g7 pawn near Black's king\n- White's queen on g3 is well-positioned for a kingside attack\n- Black's knight on h5 is somewhat exposed\n- White has good piece coordination aimed at Black's kingside\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **h6g7** - Capturing the g7 pawn would open up Black's king position significantly. This exposes the king and creates attacking possibilities.\n\n2. **g3g7** - Queen capture on g7 would be checkmate if the f7 pawn wasn't defending.\n\n3. **c4f7** - Bishop capture on f7 would be a strong attack, but Black can recapture with the rook.\n\n4. **d1d7** - Rook to d7 attacks Black's queen, but Black can simply move the queen away.\n\nLooking at tactical combinations:\n\nIf I play **c4f7+**, Black must recapture with Rxf7, then I could follow with **h6g7**, threatening the king and rook simultaneously. This would win material at minimum.\n\nAlternatively, **h6g7** immediately threatens to capture the rook on f8. If Black recaptures with Kxg7, then **g3g5+** would fork the king and knight on h5.\n\nThe combination starting with **c4f7+** seems most forcing and powerful. It creates immediate threats that Black cannot adequately defend against.\n\nAfter **c4f7+**, if Black plays Rxf7, then **h6g7** wins the exchange at minimum. If Black plays Kh8 (avoiding the bishop capture), then **g3g7#** is checkmate.\n\n```\nc4f7\n```"
