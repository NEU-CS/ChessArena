When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Equal (both sides have a queen, rook, knight, bishop, and pawns)\n- King safety: White's king is in the center, Black's king is castled but potentially vulnerable\n- Piece activity: White has an active bishop on g5 and queen on h3 pointing toward Black's kingside\n- Pawn structure: Standard for both sides\n\nKey observations:\n1. White's bishop on g5 is pinning Black's knight on f6 to the queen on d8\n2. White's queen on h3 is aligned with Black's king on h8\n3. Black's kingside has potential weaknesses with the pawn on g6 and bishop on h7\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities, I notice White has a powerful attack brewing on the kingside. The most promising ideas involve exploiting the pin on f6 and attacking Black's king.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. g5h6 (Bishop takes pawn) - This removes a defender and opens lines toward Black's king\n2. h3h7 (Queen takes bishop) - Direct attack on Black's kingside\n3. g5f6 (Bishop takes knight) - Removes a key defender and maintains pressure\n\nLet's analyze each:\n\ng5h6: Taking the pawn with the bishop opens up the h-file for a potential attack. After Bxh6, Black might play gxh6, weakening the king's position further. This move creates immediate threats.\n\nh3h7: Taking the bishop with the queen is a direct attack, but Black can respond with Kxh7, and White needs to follow up quickly.\n\ng5f6: Taking the knight removes a key defender of Black's king and maintains the pressure. This seems very strong as it opens up multiple threats.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe Bxh6 (g5h6) is the strongest move as it immediately compromises Black's king safety and sets up a powerful attack. It removes a key defensive pawn and creates immediate threats that are difficult to defend against.\n\n```\ng5h6\n```"
