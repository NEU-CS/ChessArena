When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If White moves the knight, Black gains tempo. If White exchanges with cxd4, Black recaptures and has a more active position.\n\n**c6e5**: This centralizes the knight and puts pressure on White's position, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n**c6d4**: Trading knights would simplify the position, but after cxd4, White's pawn structure improves.\n\n**e8e4**: This rook move pressures the d4 knight, but White can defend with moves like Qd3.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the most active and strongest move is to attack White's centralized knight directly:\n\n```\nd6d4\n```\n\nThis move puts immediate pressure on White's knight, forcing a response. If White moves the knight, Black gains tempo. If White captures with cxd4, Black recaptures and improves piece activity. This move also opens the d-file for potential rook activity later."
