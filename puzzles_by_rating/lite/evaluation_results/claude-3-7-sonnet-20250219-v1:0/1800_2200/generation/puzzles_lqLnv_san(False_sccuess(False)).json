When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the material:\n- White has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, a knight, and pawns\n- Black has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, a knight, and pawns\n\nMaterial seems roughly equal, but White has strong attacking pressure:\n- White's rook on b7 is deeply infiltrated in Black's position\n- White's queen on a4 is active and threatening\n- White has a bishop pair pointing toward Black's kingside\n\nKey threats and weaknesses:\n1. White's rook on b7 threatens Black's a7 pawn\n2. Black's king is still in the center and hasn't castled\n3. White's pieces are more active and coordinated\n\nLet me consider my options:\n\nCastling kingside with `e8g8` seems urgent to get my king to safety. However, I need to check if this is safe given White's attacking pieces.\n\nAfter castling, White's bishop on d3 would be targeting my g7 pawn, but there's no immediate mate threat I can see. Getting my king to safety should be the priority.\n\nOther candidate moves:\n- `c6e5`: Knight to e5 would develop with tempo, but doesn't address the king safety issue\n- `a8c8`: Connecting rooks, but still leaves the king in the center\n- `d8c7`: Queen move to defend the a7 pawn, but doesn't solve king safety\n\nThe most pressing issue is king safety, and castling kingside appears to be the best option. After castling, I can work on connecting my rooks and defending against White's attack.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
