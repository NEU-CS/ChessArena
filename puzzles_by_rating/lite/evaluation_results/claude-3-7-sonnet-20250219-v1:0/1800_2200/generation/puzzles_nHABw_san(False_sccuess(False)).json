When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a bishop, two rooks, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: My king on g1 is relatively safe. Black's king on g8 is somewhat exposed.\n- Piece activity: My knight on e5 is very active and potentially threatening.\n\nLet me examine tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Knight moves from e5:\n   - e5f7: This is a fork attacking Black's king and queen! This would win Black's queen for a knight.\n   - e5d7: Attacks Black's knight but doesn't seem as strong as f7.\n   - e5g6: Attacks the f-pawn but doesn't win material.\n   - Other knight moves seem less impactful.\n\n2. Bishop moves from d3:\n   - d3h7: Threatens the h-pawn but not immediately decisive.\n   - d3g6: Attacks the f7 pawn but can be captured.\n   - Other bishop moves don't seem to offer immediate advantages.\n\n3. Queen and rook moves don't seem to offer immediate tactical advantages.\n\nThe move e5f7 stands out dramatically as it forks Black's king and queen. After Nf7, Black's king must move, and I'll capture the queen next move, gaining a massive material advantage.\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
