When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White's knight on e7 is threatening Black's rook on f8\n2. White's queen on g5 is creating pressure\n3. Black has a rook on h1 that seems to be undefended but potentially powerful\n\nLet me check for immediate threats or tactical opportunities:\n- Black's rook on h1 is on the same rank as White's king on g4\n- This suggests a potential check or even checkmate opportunity\n\nExamining the h1 rook moves:\n- h1g1 would be check, but the king can escape to f4 or h4\n- However, if I look at h1h4+, this is a check that the White king cannot escape from!\n\nThe move h1h4+ would be checkmate because:\n1. The White king on g4 cannot capture the rook (not adjacent)\n2. Cannot move to f4 (covered by Black's queen on e5)\n3. Cannot move to g3 (blocked by White's own pawn)\n4. Cannot move to h3 (blocked by White's own pawn)\n5. Cannot move to h5 (blocked by White's own pawn)\n6. Cannot move to f5 (covered by Black's pawn on g6)\n\nThis is a forced checkmate in one move!\n\n```\nh1h4\n```"
