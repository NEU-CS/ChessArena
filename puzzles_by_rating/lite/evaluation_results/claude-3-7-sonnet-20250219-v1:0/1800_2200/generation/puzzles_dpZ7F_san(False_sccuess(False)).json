When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me analyze the current board state and the legal moves available to me.\n\nCurrent position analysis:\n- Material is roughly equal\n- White has developed their pieces well with the queen at e2, bishops at b5 and e3, and knights at c3 and f3\n- Black (my side) has some development with knights at f6 and e5, and a bishop at g4\n- My queen is still at d8 and king at e8\n- White's bishop on b5 is pinning something - likely threatening my c6 knight (though it's not visible on the board)\n\nLet me evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. **d8d7** (Queen to d7):\n   - Develops my queen\n   - Blocks the bishop pin on the c6 square\n   - Connects my rooks\n   - Doesn't immediately threaten anything\n\n2. **f6d7** (Knight from f6 to d7):\n   - Moves my knight from a good outpost\n   - Blocks the bishop pin\n   - Weakens my kingside defense\n\n3. **e5d7** (Knight from e5 to d7):\n   - Moves my centralized knight\n   - Blocks the bishop pin\n   - Gives up control of central squares\n\n4. **e5c6** (Knight from e5 to c6):\n   - Moves my knight to protect against the bishop pin\n   - Maintains a knight in play\n   - Gives up central control\n\n5. **g4d7** (Bishop from g4 to d7):\n   - Moves my bishop from an active position\n   - Blocks the pin\n   - Gives up the pin I have on White's knight\n\nLooking at these options, I need to address the pin from the b5 bishop. The best move appears to be **d8d7**, as it develops my queen, connects my rooks, and addresses the pin without sacrificing my well-placed minor pieces. Moving either knight would weaken my position, and moving the bishop from g4 would give up a tactical advantage.\n\n```\nd8d7\n```"
