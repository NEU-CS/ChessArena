When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on b1, somewhat exposed. Black's king is on c7.\n- Pawn structure: Complex pawn structure with both sides having passed pawns.\n- Black's rook on h1 is threatening White's position.\n\nThe most urgent issue is Black's rook on h1, which is threatening to cause problems on White's back rank. I need to address this threat immediately.\n\nLet's consider candidate moves:\n1. **f3h3**: Moving the rook to h3 would defend against the h1 rook and potentially prepare to capture the h1 rook.\n2. **f2h2**: Directly attacking Black's rook.\n3. **b1c1/a1**: King moves to escape potential back rank issues.\n4. **f3a3**: Rook move to potentially target Black's a4 pawn.\n\nThe most direct and forceful move appears to be f2h2, directly attacking Black's rook on h1. This forces Black to either move the rook or lose it. If Black moves the rook, White gains tempo and can improve position elsewhere.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the best move is:\n\n```\nf2h2\n```"
