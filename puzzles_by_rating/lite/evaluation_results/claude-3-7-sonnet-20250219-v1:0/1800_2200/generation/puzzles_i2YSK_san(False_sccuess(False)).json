When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material count: White has a queen, rook, knight, and 7 pawns. Black has a queen, two rooks, knight, and 7 pawns. So material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on f1, somewhat exposed. Black's king is on e7.\n- Piece activity: White's queen is on h6, actively threatening Black's position.\n- Immediate threats: Black's rook on g2 is threatening White's position.\n\nLet me check for immediate tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Queen captures: I notice White's queen on h6 can capture Black's queen on g8 with h6g8, but this would be a queen trade that doesn't gain material.\n\n2. Looking at h6f8: This is a queen check that forces the Black king to move, but doesn't seem to lead to immediate advantage.\n\n3. Looking at h6h8: Capturing the rook would be a blunder as Black's queen would recapture.\n\n4. The move h6g7 looks very strong - it attacks the Black queen on g8 and threatens checkmate on h7. Black would be forced to give up the queen or get checkmated.\n\nLet's verify h6g7:\n- If Black plays g8g7 (queen captures our queen), then h3h7+ forces the king to f8, and h7f7 is checkmate.\n- If Black tries to defend with another move like f7f5, then we can capture the queen with g7g8.\n\nThis is a decisive tactical blow that will either win Black's queen or lead to checkmate.\n\n```\nh6g7\n```"
