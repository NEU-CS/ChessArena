When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this endgame position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nCurrent position analysis:\n- Material: Both sides have a pawn structure and Black has a bishop\n- White has pawns on c5, d6, and g6\n- Black has a bishop on g7 and king on d7\n- White's king is on f5\n- It's Black to move\n\nLet me evaluate the position and the available legal moves:\n\n1) Pawn structure: White has connected pawns on c5 and d6, plus an isolated pawn on g6. These pawns are quite advanced.\n2) Black's bishop on g7 is active but needs to find the best square.\n3) Black's king on d7 is adjacent to White's d6 pawn.\n\nLet's consider the candidate moves:\n\nBishop moves:\n- Moving the bishop to h8, f8, h6, f6 would be passive and limit its mobility\n- Moving to e5 would put pressure on c5 pawn but could be driven away by the White king\n- Moving to d4, c3, b2, a1 would place the bishop on the long diagonal, which could be powerful\n\nKing moves:\n- d7e8: Moving away from the center\n- d7d8: Moving away from the center\n- d7c8: Moving away from the center\n- d7c6: Moving toward the c5 pawn, potentially putting pressure on it\n\nThe key strategic considerations:\n1) We need to prevent White's pawns from promoting\n2) We should try to capture White's pawns if possible\n3) We need to keep our bishop active\n\nThe move g7b2 stands out as it places the bishop on the long diagonal, controlling key squares and potentially threatening White's pawns in the future. From b2, the bishop would control the a1-h8 diagonal and could help stop White's pawns.\n\nAlternatively, d7c6 would put the king in position to attack the c5 pawn directly.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the best move is to place the bishop on the long diagonal with:\n\n```\ng7b2\n```\n\nThis move maximizes the bishop's activity and influence over the board while maintaining flexibility for future plans."
