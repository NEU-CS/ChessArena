When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed. White's king is on h2.\n- Piece activity: Black's pieces are active, especially the knight on e4 and rooks on e5 and e8.\n- Threats: Black's knight on e4 is threatening several squares.\n\nLet me look for tactical opportunities:\n\n1. The knight on e4 is very powerful and can potentially fork pieces.\n2. The queen on c5 combined with the rook on e5 creates pressure.\n3. The knight on e4 can move to f2, creating a fork between White's king on h2 and rook on f1.\n\nExamining the e4f2 move more closely:\n- If the knight moves to f2, it would fork White's king and rook.\n- White would be forced to move the king, allowing Black to capture the rook on f1.\n- This would be a clear material gain.\n\nLet's verify there are no better options:\n- No immediate checkmate threats\n- No other forks or pins that would win more material\n- The knight fork appears to be the strongest tactical opportunity\n\nThe move e4f2 stands out as clearly the best, winning a rook for a knight, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n```\ne4f2\n```"
