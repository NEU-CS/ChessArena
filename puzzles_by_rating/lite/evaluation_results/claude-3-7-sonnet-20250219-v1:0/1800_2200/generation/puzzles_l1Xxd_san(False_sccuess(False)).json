When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White is threatening to promote the h7 pawn to a queen\n2. Black needs to either stop the promotion or find a winning counterplay\n3. Black's king is centralized, which could be an advantage\n\nLet me examine the critical lines:\n\nOption 1: Stop the promotion with h2h7\nIf I play h2h7, White can capture with g7xh7, and the pawn will still promote next move.\n\nOption 2: Checkmate threats\nLooking at the position, I notice Black's rook on h2 is on the same rank as White's king on g1. If I can keep White busy and move my rook to deliver check, I might have a chance.\n\nThe move h2h1+ would deliver an immediate checkmate! White's king on g1 has no escape squares, and no pieces can block or capture the rook.\n\nThis is a clear winning move that ends the game immediately.\n\n```\nh2h1\n```"
