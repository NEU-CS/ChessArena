When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, bishop, knight, queen, and 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- White's rook on g7 is actively placed and threatening Black's position.\n- Black's king is on e7, potentially vulnerable.\n- Black's queen on c3 is attacking White's position.\n\nLet me consider the most promising moves:\n\n1. **f1f7**: Direct attack on the black king, checking it and capturing the bishop simultaneously. This looks very strong.\n\n2. **g7f7**: Capturing the bishop with the rook, but this allows Black to recapture with the king.\n\n3. **e3e4**: Attacking the knight, but this doesn't seem as forcing as other options.\n\n4. **f1f7** seems most promising. Let's analyze what happens after:\n   - If Black's king takes: Kxf7\n   - Then White can play Qxe4+, attacking both the king and rook on b1\n   - Black must move the king, and White captures the rook, gaining material\n\nThis is a clear winning sequence for White. The move f1f7 creates an immediate threat that Black cannot adequately defend against, leading to significant material gain.\n\n```\nf1f7\n```"
