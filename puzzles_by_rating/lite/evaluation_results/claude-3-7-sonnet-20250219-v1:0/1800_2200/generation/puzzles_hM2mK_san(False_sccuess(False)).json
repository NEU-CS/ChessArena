When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Bishop moves (c7 to various squares):\n   - The bishop is currently very active on the a5-e1 diagonal\n   - Moving to g3 or h2 could be interesting to attack near Black's king\n\n2. King moves (f1 to f2, e2, or g1):\n   - Moving the king could help activate it\n\n3. Pawn moves (f3f4 or b3b4):\n   - These advance pawns but need to check if they're beneficial\n\nLet me look at specific tactical opportunities:\n\nThe move c7g3 looks very promising as it attacks Black's king directly. If Black captures with h4xg3, White can play f3xg3 creating a passed pawn that will be difficult for Black to stop.\n\nIf Black doesn't capture and moves the king away, White maintains the bishop attack and can continue to pressure.\n\nLet's verify this is the best move by checking alternatives:\n- King moves don't create immediate threats\n- Other bishop moves don't create the same level of pressure\n- Pawn moves don't create immediate threats\n\nThe move c7g3 creates the most immediate pressure and forces Black to respond to a direct threat.\n\n```\nc7g3\n```"
