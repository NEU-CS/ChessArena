When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a knight and 4 pawns; White has a rook and 2 pawns. Material is roughly equal (knight + 4 pawns \u2248 rook + 2 pawns)\n- King positions: Black king on d7, White king on e4\n- Key features: White's rook on b6 is active, Black has connected passed pawns on g4 and h4\n- The c5 pawn is potentially dangerous\n\nLet me evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. King moves (d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7e7, d7c7):\n   - Most king moves seem passive and don't improve Black's position\n   - d7c7 might walk into some rook checks\n\n2. Knight moves (b7d8, b7d6, b7c5, b7a5):\n   - b7c5 captures White's pawn, but might lose the knight to Rb5\n   - b7d6 blocks the rook's attack on e6 pawn\n   - b7d8 seems passive\n   - b7a5 moves away from the action\n\n3. Pawn moves (e6e5, h4h3, g4g3):\n   - e6e5 creates a passed pawn but might be vulnerable\n   - Advancing the h and g pawns could be decisive if they can promote\n\nThe connected passed pawns on the kingside are Black's biggest asset. If they can advance, they could force White to sacrifice the rook or allow a promotion.\n\nLet's check h4h3 and g4g3:\n- After h4h3, White's king is too far to stop both pawns\n- After g4g3, similarly White can't stop both pawns from promoting\n\nThe knight move b7d6 is also interesting as it protects the e6 pawn and restricts the rook.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe advancing the passed pawns is the most promising plan. Between h4h3 and g4g3, advancing the h-pawn creates a more immediate threat.\n\n```\nh4h3\n```"
