When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a rook, bishop, knight, queen, and king vs White's two rooks, two knights, queen, and king. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on b7, somewhat exposed. White's king is on g1, well protected.\n- Pawn structure: Black has several pawns including an advanced h4 pawn that could be dangerous.\n- Piece activity: Black has active pieces, particularly the queen on e6 and knight on g6.\n\nLet's consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **g6f4**: Knight attacking White's queen on e2. This looks very promising as it threatens to win material.\n   - If White moves the queen, Black can capture the knight on f5.\n   - If White captures with Nxf4, Black recaptures exf4 with a strong pawn structure.\n\n2. **e6f5**: Queen attacking the knight on f5, but White can simply capture with Qxf5.\n\n3. **h7h5**: Advancing the rook to an active file, but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n4. **b5b4**: Advancing the queenside pawn, but doesn't address immediate tactical opportunities.\n\n5. **e5e4**: Breaking in the center, but doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n\nThe move g6f4 stands out as clearly the strongest. It creates a fork between White's queen and knight, forcing White to either lose material or accept a worse position after exchanges.\n\n```\ng6f4\n```"
