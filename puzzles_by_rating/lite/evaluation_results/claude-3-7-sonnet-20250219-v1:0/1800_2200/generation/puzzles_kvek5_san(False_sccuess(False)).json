When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook, two knights, a bishop, and 3 pawns. Black has a rook, a bishop, two knights, and 5 pawns. So material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on g1, relatively safe. Black's king is on f7, somewhat exposed.\n- Piece activity: White has knights on g4 and h4 that could potentially create threats.\n- Pawn structure: White has a passed c-pawn that could be valuable.\n\nLet me examine some candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves from g4 or h4**: \n   - g4f6 looks promising as it attacks the Black knight on e6.\n   - h4f5 could pressure e7 and the e-pawn.\n\n2. **Bishop moves**:\n   - g3e5 would attack the knight on d4.\n\n3. **Rook moves**:\n   - Moving the rook to an open file could increase its activity.\n\n4. **Pawn advances**:\n   - b4b5 might help advance the passed c-pawn.\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities:\n- If I play g4f6, attacking the knight on e6, Black would likely capture with Kxf6, and then I could play h4g6+ forking the king and rook.\n- The knight on d4 is a target that I could attack with g3e5.\n\nLet me calculate the g4f6 idea:\n1. g4f6 Kxf6 (if Black plays something else, I've won a piece)\n2. h4g6 Kg7 (forced)\n3. g6xh8 capturing the rook\n\nThis looks like a winning combination that nets me a rook for a knight.\n\nLet me double-check if there are any better options or defenses for Black:\n- If Black doesn't capture on f6, I've simply won a piece.\n- If after g4f6 Kxf6, h4g6+ Kg7, I capture the rook and I'm up material.\n\nI don't see any better moves in this position. The knight sacrifice leading to a rook capture is decisive.\n\n```\ng4f6\n```"
