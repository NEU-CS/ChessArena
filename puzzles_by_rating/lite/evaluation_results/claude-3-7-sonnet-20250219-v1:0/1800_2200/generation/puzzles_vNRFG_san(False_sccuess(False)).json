When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King activity and centralization\n2. Creating passed pawns\n3. Stopping White's potential passed pawns\n4. Timing of pawn advances\n\nLet's examine the candidate moves:\n\n1. **c5c4**: This creates a passed pawn and challenges White's pawn structure. After c5c4, White must decide whether to capture with the king or push c3c4. If White plays c3c4, Black's a4 pawn becomes stronger.\n\n2. **b5b4**: This move attacks White's a3 pawn and could create a passed pawn. However, White can respond with c3c4 to complicate matters.\n\n3. King moves: Moving the king to support the pawn advance seems logical. **d6e5** would approach the center and potentially support future pawn advances.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe **c5c4** is the strongest move. It creates immediate pressure, forces White to make a decision, and potentially creates a passed pawn. This move also restricts White's king and gives Black more control over the position.\n\n```\nc5c4\n```"
