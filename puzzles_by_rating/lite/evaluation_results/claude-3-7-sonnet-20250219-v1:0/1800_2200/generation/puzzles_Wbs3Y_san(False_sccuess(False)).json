When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, bishop, queen, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is exposed with the Black knight on f3 threatening checks.\n- Threats: Black's rook on b2 is threatening White's second rank. Black's queen on g6 and knight on f3 are creating pressure.\n\nLet me examine key tactical possibilities:\n\n1. **Capturing the f8 rook**: \n   - `a6a8` would capture the rook, but Black's queen can recapture with `g6a6`.\n\n2. **Knight moves**:\n   - `b5d6` would capture the bishop with the knight, but Black can recapture with the queen.\n   - `b5c7` would fork Black's king and rook, winning material.\n\n3. **Queen moves**:\n   - `a6c8` doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n   - `a6b7` would attack the rook on b2, but the rook can simply move away.\n\n4. **Dealing with the knight on f3**:\n   - `g2f3` would capture the knight, removing a dangerous piece.\n\nLooking at the knight fork `b5c7`, this is a powerful tactical shot that forks the king and rook. After `b5c7`, Black's king must move, allowing White to capture the rook on f8 next move.\n\nThis is clearly the strongest move as it wins material with a tactical combination.\n\n```\nb5c7\n```"
