When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's king is on h7, also somewhat exposed\n- Piece activity: White's queen on e7 is very active, controlling many squares\n- Threats: I need to check for immediate threats and tactical opportunities\n\nLet me look for tactical opportunities:\n1. Checking for checkmate threats:\n   - Moving the queen to g7 would be checkmate as the Black king has no escape squares\n   - This would be an immediate win\n\nLet me verify Qg7# works:\n- Black king is on h7\n- If queen moves to g7, it attacks h7\n- Black king can't move to h8 (off board)\n- Black king can't move to g8 (blocked by knight)\n- Black king can't capture on g7 (protected by our king)\n- Black king can't move to h6 (our queen controls that square)\n- No piece can block or capture our queen\n\nThis is a clear checkmate in one move.\n\n```\ne7g7\n```"
