When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, a knight, and 7 pawns. White has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, a knight, and 7 pawns. So material is even.\n- King safety: Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed. White's queen on h5 is threatening the h7 pawn and potentially setting up an attack.\n- Threats: White's queen on h5 is the most immediate threat, potentially targeting h7 and the king.\n- White's bishop on c4 is also active and could be part of an attack.\n\nThe most urgent issue is addressing the threat from White's queen. Let's consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **h7h6** - This defends the h7 pawn but could weaken the king's position further.\n\n2. **g7f8** or **g7f6** - Moving the king away from the threat. This seems prudent.\n\n3. **e5g6** - The knight could move to g6 to block the queen's attack on h7.\n\n4. **e7f6** - Developing the bishop to f6 could help defend the kingside.\n\nLooking at these options, I think **e5g6** is the strongest move. It blocks the queen's attack on h7, defends the king, and maintains the knight in an active central position. This move addresses the immediate threat while maintaining good piece coordination.\n\n```\ne5g6\n```"
