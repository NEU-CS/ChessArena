When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the current state of the board.\n\nFirst, let me understand the position:\n- I'm playing as Black with my king on g8\n- White has a pawn on f7 which is one move away from promotion\n- My rook is on b1, and I have a queen on b1\n- White's king is on h3, with a rook on f2 and bishop on f4\n- I have very limited legal moves: g8h8, g8f8, g8h7, g8g7, g8f7\n\nThe most critical factor is White's pawn on f7, which threatens to promote on the next move. This would be devastating. Let me analyze each of my legal moves:\n\n1. g8h8: Moving to the corner doesn't prevent the pawn promotion.\n2. g8f8: This blocks the pawn's promotion square, preventing immediate promotion.\n3. g8h7: This doesn't prevent pawn promotion.\n4. g8g7: This doesn't prevent pawn promotion.\n5. g8f7: This captures the pawn, eliminating the promotion threat entirely.\n\nClearly, I need to either block or capture the pawn. Between g8f8 (blocking) and g8f7 (capturing), capturing is superior as it eliminates the threat completely rather than just delaying it.\n\nAfter g8f7, I'll have removed White's most dangerous threat. My queen on b1 is also attacking White's rook on f2, giving me counterplay.\n\nThe best move is clearly to capture the pawn:\n\n```\ng8f7\n```"
