When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook, bishop, and two pawns for Black's rook, bishop, knight, and pawn - roughly equal material\n- White's rook on c7 is very active and threatening Black's position\n- Black's queen on f5 is active and potentially dangerous\n- Black's knight on h4 is somewhat out of play but could become threatening\n- Both kings appear relatively safe\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **c7c8**: Exchanging rooks seems reasonable but not forcing anything special\n2. **c7f7**: Capturing the bishop would win material immediately\n3. **d4f6**: Queen move attacking the e6 pawn with a potential fork\n4. **d4g7**: Queen attacking the bishop on f7 and threatening mate on g7\n5. **d6d7**: Advancing the passed pawn\n\nLooking at c7f7 more closely - this captures Black's bishop directly. After Black recaptures with gxf7, White would have a material advantage. This is a clear material gain.\n\nLooking at d4g7 - this threatens immediate checkmate. If Black's bishop moves, White can play Qxg7#. Black would have to defend with Qg6, but then White can capture the bishop on f7 anyway.\n\nLet me check d4f6 - this attacks the e6 pawn and threatens the knight on h4. However, Black can defend with Qg6.\n\nThe move d6d7 advances the passed pawn but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the strongest move is d4g7, threatening immediate checkmate. Black must respond with Qg6 to prevent mate, after which White can still capture the bishop on f7 with the rook, winning material.\n\n```\nd4g7\n```"
