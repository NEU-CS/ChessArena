When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, a bishop, and 5 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on e1, somewhat exposed. Black's king is on h6, also exposed.\n- Piece activity: White has two rooks on the 7th and 3rd ranks, which are well-positioned. The g7 rook is particularly threatening.\n\nLet's examine the position more deeply:\n1. White's rook on g7 is attacking Black's bishop on f7.\n2. If White captures the bishop with g7f7, Black's rook on c7 can recapture.\n3. White's rook on g3 is controlling the g-file.\n4. Black's rook on a1 is threatening White's bishop on d1.\n\nKey tactical opportunities:\n- The most striking feature is Black's king position on h6, which could be vulnerable to a mating attack.\n- White's two rooks could potentially coordinate for a checkmate.\n\nLet me check if there's a forced mate or winning sequence:\n- If g3g6+, Black's king must move to h7 or g5.\n- If the king moves to h7, White can play g7g6 followed by g6h6#.\n- If the king moves to g5, White can play g7g5+ winning the Black king.\n\nThis is a clear winning sequence:\n\n1. g3g6+ forces the Black king to move\n   - If Kh7, then g7g6+ followed by g6h6#\n   - If Kg5, then g7g5+ wins the king\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng3g6\n```\n\nThis move delivers check and sets up a forced mate sequence regardless of how Black responds."
