When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position step by step to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook, knight, and queen (roughly 14 points)\n- Black has two rooks and a queen (roughly 14 points)\n- So material is approximately equal\n- Black's queen on h3 is threatening White's position\n- Black's rook on f3 is also very active and threatening\n- White's rook on b8 is active but not immediately threatening\n- Black's king on f7 might be vulnerable\n\nKey threats:\n1. Black's queen on h3 is threatening mate on g2\n2. Black's rook on f3 is controlling the f-file and threatening the f2 pawn\n3. White needs to address these immediate threats\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **b2g7+**: Queen check that forces the king to move\n2. **b2f6+**: Another queen check\n3. **b8b7**: Attacking Black's a7 pawn\n4. **f1e1**: Defending against potential threats on the e-file\n5. **b2e5**: Queen move to a more central position\n\nLet's analyze the most promising moves:\n\n**b2g7+**:\n- Forces Black's king to move (likely to e8 or e7)\n- After the king moves, White can potentially follow up with more checks\n- This could lead to a strong attack\n\n**b2f6+**:\n- Also forces the king to move\n- But after the king moves, it's not clear if White has a strong follow-up\n\n**b8b7**:\n- Attacks the a7 pawn\n- But doesn't address the immediate threats from Black's queen and rook\n\nAfter careful consideration, the queen check on g7 seems most promising as it forces Black's king to move and could lead to a winning attack.\n\n```\nb2g7\n```"
