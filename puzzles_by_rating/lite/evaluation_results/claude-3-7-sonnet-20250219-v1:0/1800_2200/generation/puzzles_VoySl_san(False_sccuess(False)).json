When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me break down the current situation:\n\n1) Material count:\n   - Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 8 Pawns (standard material)\n   - White: Queen, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, 8 Pawns (standard material)\n   So material is equal.\n\n2) Position assessment:\n   - Black has not castled yet, but has the option to castle kingside (e8g8)\n   - White's king is still in the center (e1)\n   - Black has developed most pieces, with knights on c6 and e5, bishops on d7 and g7\n   - White has a bishop on f4, knights on f3 and h2, and queen on e2\n\n3) Key tactical considerations:\n   - The knight on e5 is well-placed but potentially under threat\n   - Castling would improve king safety\n   - There might be tactical opportunities against White's uncastled king\n\nLet me consider the best candidate moves:\n\n1) e8g8 (castling kingside): This improves king safety and connects the rooks, which is a priority in the middlegame.\n\n2) e5f3: This captures White's knight, but after Qxf3, Black loses a piece as the knight is not protected.\n\n3) e5c4: This attacks White's queenside but doesn't seem to win material.\n\n4) c6d4: This knight move attacks the center but might be vulnerable.\n\n5) d8e7: This develops the queen to a reasonable square but delays castling.\n\nAfter analyzing these options, castling kingside (e8g8) stands out as the best move. It improves king safety, which is crucial since White's pieces are positioned for potential kingside attacks. Castling also connects the rooks and prepares for future action on the central files.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
