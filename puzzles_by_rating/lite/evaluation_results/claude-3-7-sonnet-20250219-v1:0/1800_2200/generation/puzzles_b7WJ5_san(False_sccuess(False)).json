When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, bishop, and 2 pawns (f6, h3).\n- Black's king is on h6, White's king on e1\n- Black's queen on b3 is active\n- White's queen on d6 and bishop on d4 are centralized\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Black's king safety - currently exposed\n2. Material balance - roughly equal\n3. Attacking opportunities\n4. Defensive needs\n\nLet me analyze some candidate moves:\n\n1. **b3e6** - Capturing White's queen would be decisive if possible, but the queen is protected by the bishop on d4.\n\n2. **b3h3** - Capturing White's h-pawn would win material. Let's check if this is safe. After Qxh3, White can't immediately recapture because the pawn is pinned against the king.\n\n3. **b3c4** - Attacking White's bishop. If White moves the bishop, Black could then capture the queen.\n\n4. **b3d5** - Threatens both the queen and bishop. This double attack (fork) looks very strong.\n\n5. **g5g4** - Advancing the pawn to attack White's h3 pawn, but this seems less urgent.\n\nThe move **b3d5** stands out as particularly strong. It creates a fork attacking both White's queen and bishop. White cannot save both pieces, so Black will gain material. This is a decisive tactical opportunity.\n\n```\nb3d5\n```"
