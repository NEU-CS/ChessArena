When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, bishop, knight, and 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on h8, somewhat exposed. White's king is on c1.\n- Piece activity: Black's queen is active at a2, rook at c8, knight at e5.\n- Threats: White's queen on h5 is threatening the h-file and potentially mate.\n\nLet me check for immediate threats:\n- White's queen on h5 is threatening the h-file, but there's no immediate mate.\n- Black's queen on a2 is attacking White's b-pawn.\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n1. **a2a1**: Queen promotion threat, but White can defend with Bb5.\n2. **e5g6**: Knight captures pawn, removing a defender near Black's king.\n3. **e5f7**: Knight fork of White's queen and potentially threatening g-pawn.\n4. **c8c1**: Direct rook check on White's king.\n5. **a2b1**: Queen check on White's king.\n\nWait, I need to verify if c8c1 is actually in the legal moves list... I don't see it, so the rook can't reach c1 directly.\n\nLooking at the knight moves more carefully:\n- **e5f7** would fork White's queen and g-pawn, but I don't see the queen on that diagonal.\n- **e5g6** captures White's advanced pawn, which seems strong.\n\nThe queen move **a2b1+** gives a check and attacks the knight on b3.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the strongest move is to give check with the queen while also attacking the knight:\n\n```\na2b1\n```"
