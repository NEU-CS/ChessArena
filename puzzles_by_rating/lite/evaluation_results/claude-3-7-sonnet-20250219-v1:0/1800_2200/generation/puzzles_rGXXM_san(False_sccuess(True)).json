White is threatening to promote the e7 pawn to a queen next move\n2. I need to address this immediate threat\n3. The position of my king on f6 and White's king on h4 could be relevant\n\nLet me analyze the candidate moves:\n\n1. Direct defense against promotion:\n   - e8e7: Capturing the pawn solves the immediate threat\n\n2. King moves:\n   - f6e6, f6f5, f6f7, f6g7: These don't address the immediate promotion threat\n   - The king is relatively safe but needs to stay close to control the promotion square\n\n3. Pawn moves:\n   - g6g5+: This gives a check but doesn't stop the promotion\n   - b6b5: This doesn't address the immediate threat\n\nThe most critical move is e8e7, capturing the pawn that's about to promote. This eliminates White's immediate threat and maintains material balance.\n\nAfter e8e7, I'll have a rook and 3 pawns vs White's rook and 3 pawns, with my king better positioned than White's. This should give me good winning chances.\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"

After Kxe7, White would be left with just a king and pawns against my king and pawns, giving me a decisive advantage.\n\n2. **f6f5**\n   This king move doesn't capture anything and actually moves away from the rook. This would allow White to keep their rook advantage, which is losing for me.\n\n3. **g6g5+**\n   This pawn move gives a check to White's king, but after Kxg5, White still has their rook and I've just weakened my pawn structure.\n\n4. **b6b5**\n   This pawn advance doesn't address the immediate threat of White's rook and doesn't improve my position significantly.\n\nThe evaluation is clear: capturing White's rook with f6e7 is by far the best move. It wins a major piece for free, which should be decisive in this endgame position. After this capture, I'll have a winning position with my king and pawns against White's lone king and pawns.\n\n```\nf6e7\n```"
