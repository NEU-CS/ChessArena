When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: White has a knight, bishop, and 4 pawns. Black has a rook and 3 pawns. So White is slightly ahead in material.\n- King safety: White's king is on d2, relatively safe. Black's king is on h6, in the corner.\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have some advanced pawns.\n\nLet me evaluate some key candidate moves:\n\n1. Knight moves (c6d8, c6b8, c6e7, etc.):\n   - The knight is well-positioned on c6, controlling important squares\n   - Moving to e5 (c6e5) looks interesting as it attacks the f-pawn\n\n2. Bishop moves (g2d5, g2e4, etc.):\n   - Moving to e4 (g2e4) would attack the f4 pawn\n   - Moving to d5 would control important diagonals\n\n3. King moves (d2c3, d2e2, etc.):\n   - The king could move toward the center or queenside\n\n4. Pawn moves (g3f4, g3g4, d3d4, a3a4):\n   - g3f4 would capture Black's pawn\n   - Other pawn advances could strengthen White's position\n\nThe move g3f4 stands out as it captures a pawn immediately. Let me check if there are any tactical issues with this capture.\n\nAfter g3f4, Black's rook on f6 would still be defended by the g5 pawn. White would gain a pawn without immediate consequences. This would increase White's material advantage and simplify the position.\n\nThe knight move to e5 (c6e5) is also strong, attacking Black's f-pawn, but the immediate capture with g3f4 seems more direct.\n\n```\ng3f4\n```"
