When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Very important in this middle game position.\n\n2. **g5e7**: Capturing Black's bishop would win material.\n\n3. **c4d5**: Pawn capture that could open lines and challenge the center.\n\n4. **f3e5**: Knight recapture of Black's knight on e4, which would maintain material balance.\n\n5. **g5f6**: Bishop move attacking the g7 pawn, creating threats.\n\nLet's analyze these options:\n\n**e1g1 (Castling)**: This improves king safety but doesn't address the immediate tactical situation. Black's knight on e4 is threatening White's bishop on d2.\n\n**g5e7**: This captures Black's bishop, but after Black recaptures with ...f7e7, White still needs to deal with the knight on e4 threatening the d2 bishop.\n\n**f3e5**: This recaptures Black's knight on e4, eliminating the threat to the d2 bishop. After Black recaptures with d5e4, White would have eliminated the knight threat.\n\n**c4d5**: This opens lines but after Black recaptures, White still has the problem with the knight on e4.\n\n**g5f6**: This creates a threat on g7 but doesn't address the immediate knight threat on d2.\n\nThe most pressing issue is Black's knight on e4 threatening White's bishop on d2. Therefore, the best move is to recapture that knight:\n\n```\nf3e5\n```"
