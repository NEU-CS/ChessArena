When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is tucked away at h1, while Black's king is at g8.\n- Piece activity: White's rook on f5 is very active, threatening the e6 rook.\n- Immediate threats: White can capture the rook on e6 with the queen.\n\nLet me consider the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **c4e6** (Queen captures rook): This wins a rook for free, which would give White a decisive material advantage.\n\n2. **f5f8+**: This is a check, but after Kg7, White doesn't have a clear follow-up.\n\n3. **b2g7**: Bishop to g7 threatens the h6 pawn but doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n\n4. **c4c8+**: Queen check, but Black can block with Qb8 or Re8.\n\nThe move c4e6 stands out as clearly the strongest. Let's double-check if there are any tactical issues:\n- After c4e6, Black's queen on b6 defends the e6 square, so Black would recapture with Qxe6.\n- However, this allows White to play f5e5, forking Black's queen and knight on g5.\n- After Black moves the queen, White can capture the knight on g5.\n\nSo the sequence would be:\n1. c4e6 Qxe6\n2. f5e5 (forking queen and knight)\n\nThis wins material for White, as Black can't save both pieces.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc4e6\n```"
