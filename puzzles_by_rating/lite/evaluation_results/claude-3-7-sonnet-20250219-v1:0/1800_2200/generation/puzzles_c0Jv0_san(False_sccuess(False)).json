When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'm playing as Black in this position. Let me analyze the current board state:\n\n1. Material count:\n   - White has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, a knight, and pawns\n   - Black has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, a knight, and pawns\n   - Material is roughly equal, though White has a knight on e5 that's quite advanced\n\n2. Key threats:\n   - White's knight on e5 is very active and threatening\n   - My king is exposed with no development on the kingside\n   - White's queen on e2 is developed and could coordinate with other pieces\n\n3. My priorities:\n   - Develop my pieces\n   - Protect against immediate threats\n   - Secure my king's position\n\nLooking at the position more carefully, White's knight on e5 is a major concern. It's attacking my f7 square which is only defended by my king. If I don't address this, White could potentially play Nxf7, forking my king and rook.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. `f7f6` - This would drive away the knight but weakens my kingside pawn structure\n2. `e7e6` - Defends the f7 square while developing\n3. `b8d7` - Develops a knight and potentially challenges White's knight\n4. `b8c6` - Develops a knight but doesn't directly address the e5 knight\n\nI think `e7e6` is the best move here. It:\n- Defends the critical f7 square\n- Opens a diagonal for my bishop on f8\n- Helps me prepare for kingside castling\n- Contributes to my center control\n\n```\ne7e6\n```"
