When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a bishop on a7, pawns on f6, c4, h4, f2, and kings for both sides.\n- Black's king is on d6, White's king is on e2.\n- Black is playing in this position.\n\nLet me evaluate the key factors:\n\n1) Material count:\n   - Black: Knight (3 points) + 4 pawns (4 points) = 7 points\n   - White: Bishop (3 points) + 4 pawns (4 points) = 7 points\n   So material is equal.\n\n2) King safety and activity:\n   - Black's king is more active in the center\n   - White's king is also somewhat centralized\n\n3) Pawn structure:\n   - Black has the e4 pawn which is quite advanced\n   - The a4 pawn could become a passed pawn\n\n4) Piece activity:\n   - The knight on f7 has several potential moves\n   - White's bishop on a7 is active but not threatening anything immediately\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n\n1. e4e3: This advances the passed pawn, which could be a strong asset.\n2. Knight moves (f7e5, f7g5): Could improve knight position.\n3. King moves (d6e6, d6c6, d6e5): Could improve king activity.\n4. Pawn advances (h7h5, g6g5, a4a3): Could create passed pawns or space.\n\nThe e4e3 move stands out as particularly strong because:\n- It advances a passed pawn\n- It threatens to promote\n- It forces White to deal with this threat immediately\n- The pawn will be supported by the king\n\nThis appears to be the most forcing and advantageous move, as it creates immediate threats that White must respond to.\n\n```\ne4e3\n```"
