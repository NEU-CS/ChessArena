When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook vs Black's rook, so material is even\n- Pawn structure: White has pawns on b4, c5, e3, e6, f4 vs Black's pawns on a4, c6, c7, d5, f5\n- King positions: White's king is on g3, Black's king on b7\n- White's rook is active on f8, while Black's rook is on a3\n\nKey observations:\n1. White has a passed e-pawn on e6 that's quite advanced\n2. Black's king is cut off on the queenside\n3. White's king is more active and can potentially support pawn advances\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n1. **e6e7**: Advancing the passed pawn looks strong, threatening promotion\n2. **f8f7**: Attacking Black's c7 pawn\n3. **b4b5**: Advancing the queenside pawn\n4. **g3h4/g3f3**: King moves to potentially support pawns\n\nAnalyzing e6e7:\nThis advances our passed pawn, threatening promotion. Black would need to respond with c7-c6 to block, but then we could play f8f7 attacking the c7 pawn.\n\nAnalyzing f8f7:\nThis directly attacks the c7 pawn. If Black defends with Kb8, we can play e6e7 threatening promotion.\n\nAnalyzing b4b5:\nThis advances our queenside pawn but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\nThe most forcing line appears to be advancing the passed e-pawn with e6e7, which creates the most immediate threat and forces Black to respond defensively.\n\n```\ne6e7\n```"
