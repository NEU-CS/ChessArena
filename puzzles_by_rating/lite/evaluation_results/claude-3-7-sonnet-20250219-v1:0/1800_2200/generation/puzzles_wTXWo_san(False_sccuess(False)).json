When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, rook, bishop, and 2 pawns.\n- White is up material (roughly +5 pawns in value)\n- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed\n- Black's queen on d4 and bishop on g4 are both active pieces\n- My legal moves are limited to g1h1, g1f1, and h4f2\n\nLet me evaluate each move:\n\n1. g1h1: King move to the corner\n   - This is a safe king move but doesn't improve my position\n   - It doesn't address any immediate threats\n   - It's passive when I should be pressing my material advantage\n\n2. g1f1: King move to the f-file\n   - Similar to h1, just a king move without improving position\n   - Doesn't capitalize on my material advantage\n\n3. h4f2: Queen move from h4 to f2\n   - This move attacks Black's queen on d4 with my queen\n   - After Black moves their queen, I can potentially capture the bishop on g4\n   - This is an active move that puts pressure on Black's pieces\n\nThe move h4f2 is clearly the best as it creates an immediate threat to Black's queen. After Black responds to save their queen, I can likely capture the undefended bishop on g4, further increasing my material advantage.\n\n```\nh4f2\n```"
