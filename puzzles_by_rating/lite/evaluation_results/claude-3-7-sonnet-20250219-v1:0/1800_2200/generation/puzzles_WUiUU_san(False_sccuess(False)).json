When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the current state of the board.\n\nKey observations:\n- Material: I have a queen, bishop, and two pawns vs White's knight and three pawns\n- Kings: My king is on f2, White's king is on f5\n- Pawn structure: White has an advanced e6 pawn that could promote\n- I have a clear material advantage with my queen\n\nLet me consider my strategic options:\n1. Checkmate opportunities\n2. Material gain\n3. Stopping White's promotion threats\n4. Advancing my own pawns\n\nLooking at immediate threats:\n- White's e6 pawn is one move away from promotion\n- My queen on b2 is very powerful but needs to be used effectively\n\nLet me check for immediate checkmate opportunities with my queen:\n- Qb2-e5+ would be checkmate, but the knight on f4 protects that square\n- Qb2-f6+ would be checkmate, but the e6 pawn blocks that square\n\nI notice that Qb2-f6 would be an immediate checkmate if the e6 pawn wasn't there. This suggests a winning idea: capture the e6 pawn with my bishop and then deliver checkmate.\n\nThe move Be7xe6 would:\n1. Capture the dangerous promotion threat\n2. Set up an immediate checkmate threat with Qf6#\n3. Force White to respond to this threat\n\nAfter analyzing all options, the best move is clear:\n\n```\ne7f6\n```\n\nWait, I need to double-check this. The move e7f6 captures the e6 pawn with my bishop. After this move, I can play Qf6# next move if White doesn't respond appropriately. This is decisive."
