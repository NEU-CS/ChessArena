When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a rook, bishop, and queen vs White's rook, queen, knight, and two bishops. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is in the corner with minimal protection. White's king is also somewhat exposed.\n- Piece activity: Black has an advanced passed pawn on b2 which is very dangerous.\n- Threats: White's knight on e6 is threatening Black's rook on c8.\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **Immediate threats**: White's knight on e6 is threatening the rook on c8. I need to address this.\n\n2. **Attacking opportunities**: \n   - The passed pawn on b2 is close to promotion\n   - Black's queen on h2 could potentially deliver checkmate threats\n   - The knight on d3 is well-positioned and could create threats\n\n3. **Defensive needs**:\n   - The king on h8 is somewhat exposed\n\nLooking at the most forcing moves:\n\n- **b2b1Q**: This would be an immediate promotion, but White's rook on b1 would capture it.\n\n- **h2g1**: This looks like an immediate checkmate! White's king is on d1, and there's no piece that can block or capture the queen if it moves to g1.\n\nLet me double-check this: White's king is on d1, and if Black's queen moves to g1, there's no legal move for White to prevent checkmate. The e3 bishop can't block, the b1 rook can't capture, and the king can't escape.\n\nThis is a decisive move that ends the game immediately.\n\n```\nh2g1\n```"
