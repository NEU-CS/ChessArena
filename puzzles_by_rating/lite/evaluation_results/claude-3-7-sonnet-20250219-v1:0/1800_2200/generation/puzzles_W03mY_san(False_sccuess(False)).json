When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me first assess the current state of the board.\n\nPosition analysis:\n- Material: Roughly equal (Black has queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, 7 pawns; White has queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, knight, 8 pawns)\n- King safety: My king (Black) is castled but potentially vulnerable with White's bishop on h6 pinning my knight to my king\n- Piece activity: White has an active bishop on h6 and queen on g3, creating pressure\n- Pawn structure: White has advanced pawns on e5 and h5, potentially creating space advantage\n\nKey threats and opportunities:\n1. White's bishop on h6 is pinning my knight to my king - this is a serious issue\n2. White's queen on g3 is eyeing my kingside\n3. My bishop on b6 has a long diagonal but isn't currently threatening anything major\n4. My queen on c7 is well-placed but could be more active\n\nLet me consider the most critical candidate moves:\n\n1. **g7g6**: This would attack White's bishop on h6, forcing it to move and breaking the pin on my knight. However, after Bxg6, I'd have a weakened kingside.\n\n2. **f5f4**: This would attack White's queen, forcing it to move, and potentially gaining space.\n\n3. **b6e3**: This would attack White's queen with my bishop, forcing it to move.\n\n4. **c7c4**: This would activate my queen and potentially create threats.\n\n5. **h8g6**: This would develop my knight but might be met with Bxg6.\n\nLet me analyze the most promising options more deeply:\n\n**f5f4**: After Qh4 (White's most likely retreat), I could play g7g6 to break the pin, but White could respond with Bxg6 hxg6 Qxh8+ and I'd lose material.\n\n**b6e3**: After Qxe3, I'd lose my bishop for no compensation.\n\n**g7g6**: After Bxg6 hxg6, White's queen could attack on the h-file with Qh4, creating serious threats.\n\n**c7c4**: This activates my queen but doesn't address the immediate pin problem.\n\nI think the most urgent issue is the pin on my knight. Breaking this pin with g7g6 seems necessary, even if it weakens my kingside somewhat. After Bxg6 hxg6, White's queen attack isn't immediately decisive, and I'd have freed my knight.\n\n```\ng7g6\n```"
