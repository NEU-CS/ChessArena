When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, a knight, and 7 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- White's knight on e5 is threatening Black's queen on g6.\n- Black has two knights (b4 and f4) that are well-positioned and could create threats.\n- Black's king is castled queenside, and White's king is castled kingside.\n\nLet me consider the immediate threats:\n1. White's knight on e5 is attacking Black's queen on g6.\n2. I need to either move the queen or capture/defend against the knight.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Moving the queen: g6h6, g6f6, g6e6, etc.\n2. Capturing the knight: No direct capture is possible.\n3. Knight moves that create counterattacks: f4e2 (attacking White's queen), b4c2 (attacking White's bishop)\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities:\n- f4e2 attacks White's queen on d2, forcing it to move and relieving the pressure on my queen.\n- b4c2 attacks White's bishop on b2, but this doesn't address the immediate threat to my queen.\n- f4d3 creates a fork threat between White's queen and potentially other pieces.\n\nAfter careful analysis, f4e2 stands out as the strongest move. It attacks White's queen, creating a direct threat that must be addressed, and it does so with tempo since White must respond to protect the queen. This forces White to play defensively rather than follow through on the threat to my queen.\n\n```\nf4e2\n```"
