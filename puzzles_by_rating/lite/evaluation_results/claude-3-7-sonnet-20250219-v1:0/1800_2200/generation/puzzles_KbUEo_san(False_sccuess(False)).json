If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Both sides have 3 pawns, so material is equal\n- King positions: White king is on f6, Black king on d7\n- Pawn structure: Black has pawns on a7, c7, h4; White has pawns on a4, f4, g2\n\nThe position is in the endgame phase where king activity and pawn advancement are crucial. Let me evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. King moves (d7e8, d7d8, d7c8, d7d6, d7c6):\n   - Moving the king away from c7 pawn could be risky\n   - d7c6 might be interesting to support the c7 pawn's advance\n\n2. Pawn moves:\n   - c7c6: Advances the c-pawn with king protection\n   - a7a6/a7a5: Advances the a-pawn\n   - h4h3: Advances the h-pawn\n   - c7c5: A two-square advance of the c-pawn\n\nThe critical factor here is creating a passed pawn that can promote. The h-pawn is already advanced, but the White king is far from it. If I can advance my c-pawn while keeping my king nearby to support it, I might create winning chances.\n\nThe move c7c5 stands out as it advances the c-pawn two squares, potentially creating a strong passed pawn. My king is already positioned to support it, and White's king is currently occupied on the kingside.\n\nAfter c7c5, I'll have a passed pawn that can potentially promote with my king's support. White's king would need to rush back to stop it, which might give me time to advance my h-pawn as well.\n\n```\nc7c5\n```"
