When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, 2 rooks, a bishop, a knight, and 6 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- Black's knight on g4 is attacking my f2 pawn.\n- My knight on d4 is well-positioned in the center.\n- Black's king on g8 has limited protection.\n- Black's queen on d6 and rook on f6 are active pieces.\n\nLet's consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves from d4**:\n   - d4e6 would fork Black's queen and rook, winning material.\n   - d4f5 could pressure Black's position.\n   - Other knight moves seem less impactful.\n\n2. **Knight moves from f3**:\n   - f3g5 would attack Black's queen.\n   - f3e5 would control central squares.\n   - f3h4 would attack Black's knight.\n\n3. **Queen moves**:\n   - d1d3 would defend the d3 pawn.\n   - d1e2 would develop the queen.\n\nThe move d4e6 immediately stands out as it forks Black's queen and rook, which would win material. This is a tactical opportunity that should be seized.\n\nLet me double-check this move: Knight from d4 to e6 would attack both Black's queen on d6 and rook on f6 simultaneously. After this move, Black would have to choose which piece to save, and I would capture the other one on the next move.\n\n```\nd4e6\n```"
