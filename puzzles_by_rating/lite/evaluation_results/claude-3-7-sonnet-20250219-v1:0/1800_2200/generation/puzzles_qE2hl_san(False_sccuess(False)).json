When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Knight on e4 is attacked by the Black knight on e5 and the queen on f5. I need to address this.\n2. The e4 knight could capture on f6 or d6, potentially winning material.\n3. The bishop on c4 has several potential targets.\n4. There might be tactical opportunities involving the queen on c2.\n\nLet's analyze some candidate moves:\n\n**e4f6** (Knight takes knight):\n- This captures a piece, but after Black recaptures with gxf6, White loses the e4 knight to Black's queen on f5.\n- Not a good trade as White loses a knight for a knight.\n\n**e4d6** (Knight takes bishop):\n- This captures Black's bishop, but again, White would lose the knight to Black's queen.\n- Trading a knight for a bishop is slightly favorable, but not enough to justify the move.\n\n**c4f7** (Bishop attacks the pawn):\n- This threatens the f7 pawn, but Black can defend it with Re7-f7.\n\n**c4e6** (Bishop move):\n- Creates a discovered attack on the e5 knight through the e4 knight.\n- After Black moves the knight, White can capture it with the knight.\n\nLooking deeper at **c4e6**:\n- This creates a powerful threat. If Black moves the e5 knight, White can capture it with the e4 knight.\n- If Black captures the White knight with Qxe4, White has Bxf5 winning the queen.\n- If Black tries to save both pieces with another move, White can still take the knight on e5.\n\nThis is a strong tactical move that forces Black to lose material. After careful analysis, I believe this is the best move in the position.\n\n```\nc4e6\n```"
