When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King moves (e3f3, e3d3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2):\n   - The king should be active in endgames\n   - Moving toward the center or toward the opponent's pawns is generally good\n\n2. Pawn moves (g4f5, h4h5, g4g5):\n   - g4f5 would capture Black's f5 pawn\n   - h4h5 advances a pawn but doesn't immediately threaten anything\n   - g4g5 advances a pawn and could potentially create passed pawns\n\nLooking at g4f5 more closely:\n- This captures a pawn, giving material advantage\n- After gxf5, White would have connected passed pawns on f4 and f5\n- This would create a decisive advantage as Black's king would struggle to stop both\n\nThe move g4f5 stands out as clearly strongest because:\n1. It wins material (captures a pawn)\n2. It creates connected passed pawns\n3. It opens the g-file for potential rook activity later\n4. Black's king will be unable to stop both passed pawns\n\n```\ng4f5\n```"
