When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This is an immediate danger that must be addressed.\n\nLet's examine my options:\n\n1. Can I capture the f7 pawn? My knight on f4 can't reach it in one move.\n2. Can I block the promotion square (f8)? No, I don't have any piece that can reach f8.\n3. Can I capture the e7 knight that's protecting the pawn? Yes, with Kxe7, but that's not in my legal moves list.\n\nSince I can't directly stop the pawn promotion, I need to create a strong counterplay or find a tactical resource.\n\nLooking at knight moves:\n- f4e6 attacks White's king but doesn't create an immediate threat\n- f4d5 checks the king, but after the king moves, the f7 pawn still promotes\n- f4h3, f4d3, f4g2, f4e2 don't create immediate threats\n\nThe move d7e8 would put my king next to the promotion square, but White can still promote with check.\n\nLet me check if I can create a decisive counterattack:\n- If I play f4d5+, White's king must move, and I might be able to create threats\n- After f4d5+, White's king has limited squares (d4, e4, f4, f5, f6, d6)\n- If White's king moves to f5 or f6, I might have tactical opportunities\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the best move is to check the king with my knight, forcing a response before the pawn promotes:\n\n```\nf4d5\n```"
