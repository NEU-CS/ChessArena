When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I need to analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the material situation:\n- White has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and 5 pawns\n- Black has a queen, two rooks, a knight, and 6 pawns\n\nMaterial count is roughly equal, but the position is tactically rich. Let me analyze key aspects:\n\n1) Black's king is exposed on b7\n2) White's rook is already on g7, creating threats\n3) Black's queen on f2 is threatening White's position\n4) White's queen on a3 could potentially create threats\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n**Attacking options:**\n- `g7g8` threatens mate but Black can play `e8e1+` forcing exchanges\n- `a3a6+` is a queen check that forces `b6a6` (capturing the queen)\n- `e5d6` attacks the knight but doesn't create immediate threats\n\n**The key tactical idea:**\nI notice that White's rook on g7 combined with the bishop on e5 creates a powerful attack. If I can coordinate these pieces properly, I might find a decisive blow.\n\nLooking at `e5f6`, this move attacks the knight on d6 and also creates a discovered attack on Black's king from the rook. This is a powerful double attack.\n\nIf Black moves the knight, White can play `g7b7+` winning the game.\nIf Black moves the king to a8, White can play `g7g8` attacking the rook with devastating effect.\n\nTherefore, `e5f6` creates an unstoppable attack by threatening both the knight and creating a discovered attack on the king.\n\n```\ne5f6\n```"
