When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, two rooks, a knight, and 5 pawns. Black has two rooks, a knight, a queen, and 5 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe. Black's king is on f8 with limited protection.\n- Piece activity: Black's queen on g4 is active and threatening. Black's knight on e3 is also well-placed, forking White's f1 square and potentially other pieces.\n- Immediate threats: Black's queen on g4 threatens White's f2 pawn. Black's knight on e3 is a serious threat.\n\nLet me consider the most critical aspects:\n1. The Black knight on e3 is a major threat and needs to be addressed\n2. Black's queen on g4 is attacking White's f2 pawn\n3. White's knight on g5 and queen on d4 are well-positioned for potential attacks\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **f2xe3**: Capturing the knight would eliminate the fork threat, but leaves the queen on g4 attacking the newly moved pawn.\n2. **d4xe3**: Taking the knight with the queen would solve the immediate threat.\n3. **c1c8+**: This checks the Black king and might force a response.\n4. **d4f6**: Queen move threatening the g7 pawn and potentially setting up mating threats.\n5. **g5e6+**: Knight check that could fork the king and rook.\n\nAnalyzing the best options:\n- **d4xe3**: This captures the knight cleanly. After Black recaptures with f4xe3, White can play c1c8+ forcing the king to move, giving White a tempo.\n- **g5e6+**: This knight check forks the king and rook on d8. After the king moves, White can capture the rook.\n\nThe knight fork with g5e6+ looks strongest as it wins material immediately. After 1. g5e6+ Ke8 (forced) 2. e6xd8 Kxd8, White has won a rook for a knight, gaining a significant material advantage.\n\n```\ng5e6\n```"
