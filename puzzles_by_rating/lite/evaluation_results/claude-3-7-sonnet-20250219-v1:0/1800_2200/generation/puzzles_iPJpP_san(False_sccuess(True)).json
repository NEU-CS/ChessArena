Black has a queen, two rooks, and several pawns. Material is roughly even.\n- King safety: My king is on c1, somewhat exposed. Black's king is on g7.\n- Pawn structure: I have a pawn on e7 that's about to promote, which is a major advantage.\n\nThe most striking feature is my e7 pawn that can immediately promote to a queen. This would give me a decisive material advantage. Let's check if there are any immediate threats from Black that I need to address first.\n\nBlack's rooks are on a2 and a3, threatening my b2 pawn. Black's queen on g6 is not directly threatening anything critical. There doesn't appear to be an immediate checkmate threat against my king.\n\nGiven that I can promote my pawn to a queen immediately, this seems like the clearly winning move. Let's verify there are no better alternatives:\n\n- Queen moves like f4f6 (capturing the pawn) don't provide as much advantage as promoting to a queen\n- Rook moves don't create immediate threats\n- King moves are defensive and don't improve my position\n\nThe promotion e7e8q is clearly the strongest move, giving me an extra queen and a decisive material advantage. After this promotion, I'll be up a full queen, which should lead to a straightforward win.\n\n```\ne7e8q\n```"

After capturing the rook, I'll be in a much better position to launch a counterattack with my two queens.\n\n```\nb2c3\n```"
