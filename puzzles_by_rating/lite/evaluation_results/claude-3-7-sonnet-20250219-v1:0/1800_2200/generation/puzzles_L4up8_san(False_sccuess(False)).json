When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, 2 rooks, knight, and 7 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on g7 with some pawn protection. White has a knight on f6 that's putting pressure on Black's position.\n- Threats: White's knight on f6 is threatening Black's position. White's queen on h3 and rook on d3 are also aimed at Black's kingside.\n- Opportunities: Black has a queen on a2 that could potentially create threats.\n\nLet me examine the most critical aspects:\n1. The white knight on f6 is a major threat - it's forking the rook on f8 and threatening the h7 square near Black's king.\n2. White's queen on h3 and rook on d3 are creating pressure on Black's kingside.\n3. Black's queen on a2 is active but currently not creating immediate threats.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. `e7g8` - Knight to g8 to defend against the fork and protect the king\n2. `e7f5` - Knight to f5, attacking White's d4 pawn\n3. `a2d5` - Queen to d5, attacking White's rook on d3\n4. `g7h8` - King to h8, moving away from the knight's attack\n\nAnalyzing each candidate:\n\n`e7g8`: This defends the rook on f8 and blocks the knight's attack on h7. However, it's a passive move that doesn't create counterplay.\n\n`e7f5`: This attacks White's d4 pawn but after exf5, Black loses a knight for a pawn.\n\n`a2d5`: This attacks White's rook on d3, forcing it to move. After the rook moves, Black could potentially create threats against White's king. This seems active and promising.\n\n`g7h8`: Moving the king to h8 doesn't solve the fork problem - the knight on f6 still attacks the rook on f8.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the move `a2d5` seems strongest. It forces White's rook to move and creates active counterplay. The queen becomes centralized and can potentially create threats against White's position.\n\n```\na2d5\n```"
