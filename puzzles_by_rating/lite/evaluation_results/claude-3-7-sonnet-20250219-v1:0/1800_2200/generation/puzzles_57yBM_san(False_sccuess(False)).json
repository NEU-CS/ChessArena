When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a rook, a bishop, and 4 pawns. Material is even.\n- King safety: Black's king is on g5 with the h5 pawn providing some cover. White's king is on g1.\n- Piece activity: Black has a rook on c2 that has penetrated White's position, and another rook on d7. White has a rook on e6 that's active.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Black's rook on c2 is attacking White's g2 pawn and is very active in White's territory.\n2. White's rook on e6 is threatening Black's position.\n3. Black's king is somewhat exposed.\n\nLet me consider the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. `c2g2`: Capturing White's g2 pawn with the rook. This wins a pawn and would give Black a material advantage.\n\n2. `d7d1+`: Threatening a back-rank checkmate, but White can block with the rook or move the king.\n\n3. `c2c1+`: Checking White's king, forcing it to move.\n\n4. `f4f3`: Advancing the passed pawn, which could become dangerous.\n\nAfter analyzing these options, capturing the g2 pawn with `c2g2` seems strongest. It wins material immediately, and after White recaptures with the king, Black can continue pushing the f-pawn or improve the position of the other rook.\n\n```\nc2g2\n```"
