When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, two rooks, bishop, and several pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- White has a knight on f7 that's very deep in Black's territory\n- White's queen is on a6, also active in Black's position\n- Black's king is on b8, potentially vulnerable\n- Black has a bishop on d5 that could be targeted\n\nLet me consider tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Knight moves from f7:\n   - f7h8 captures Black's rook\n   - f7d8 captures Black's rook\n   - Both are immediate material gains\n\n2. Queen moves from a6:\n   - a6c8 would be checkmate! The queen attacks the king on b8, and the king has no escape squares.\n\n3. Other moves don't seem to offer immediate tactical advantages.\n\nThe move a6c8 delivers an immediate checkmate, which is the ultimate goal in chess. This is clearly the strongest move as it ends the game immediately.\n\n```\na6c8\n```"
