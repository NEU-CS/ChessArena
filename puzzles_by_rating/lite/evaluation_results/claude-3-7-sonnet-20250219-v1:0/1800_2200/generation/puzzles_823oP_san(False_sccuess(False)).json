When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me explore tactical possibilities:\n\n1. The most obvious candidate is Qxe8+ (h5e8), capturing a rook with check, but after Rxe8, White doesn't have an immediate follow-up.\n\n2. Qxh7+ (h5h7) looks very promising - this is a classic sacrifice against the fianchetto position. Let's calculate:\n   - After Qxh7+, Black must play Kxh7\n   - Then White has Bxf6+ forcing Black's king to move\n   - After the king moves, White has Re7+ which is devastating\n\n3. Bxh7 (e4h7) is also possible, but the queen sacrifice seems stronger.\n\n4. Qh7+ (h5h7) is a decisive sacrifice leading to a forced mate:\n   - After Kxh7, Bxf6+ forces the king to move\n   - Then Re7+ leads to a royal fork or mate\n\nThis is a classic queen sacrifice pattern against the fianchetto position. The queen sacrifice on h7 followed by the bishop check and rook lift creates an unstoppable attack.\n\n```\nh5h7\n```"
