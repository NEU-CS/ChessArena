When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White is up a rook (White has a queen, rook, and pawns vs Black's queen and pawns)\n- White has a passed pawn on f7 that's one square away from promotion\n- Black's king is on f8, directly in front of our f7 pawn\n- White's rook is on g5 with attacking potential\n\nKey observations:\n1. The f7 pawn is extremely powerful and close to promotion\n2. Black's king is in a vulnerable position\n3. White's rook on g5 can deliver checkmate with the right move\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- g5g7 would be checkmate if the king couldn't capture it, but Black can take with the king\n- b3b7 threatens the queen but allows Black to defend\n- Promoting the f7 pawn requires removing the king from f8\n\nThe most decisive move appears to be Rg7 (g5g7). Let's verify:\n- After g5g7, Black's king must move (likely to e8)\n- Then White can promote the f7 pawn to a queen with check\n- This would be a completely winning position\n\nActually, I need to double-check if g5g7 is checkmate. The black king can't move to e8 because our pawn on f7 controls that square. The king can't move to g8 because our rook would be on g7. The king can't capture the rook because our pawn on f7 protects it.\n\nThis means g5g7 is checkmate!\n\n```\ng5g7\n```"
