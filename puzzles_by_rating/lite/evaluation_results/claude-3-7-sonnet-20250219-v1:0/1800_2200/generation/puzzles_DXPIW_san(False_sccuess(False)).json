When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

These are passive.\n\n2. **f6d4** - Moving my queen to d4. This would attack Black's queen on c5, but I'd lose the pressure on Black's king area.\n\n3. **d6d4** - Moving my rook to d4. This would attack Black's queen, but the queen can simply capture my rook, which would be a material loss.\n\n4. **d1d4** - Moving my other rook to d4. This threatens Black's queen, but again, the queen can capture it.\n\nLooking more deeply, I notice a potential checkmate pattern. My queen on f6 is already putting pressure on the e7 rook and the f7 knight. If I can deliver a check while maintaining control of these escape squares, I might have a forced mate.\n\nLet me check if Qf6-d8+ works:\n- After Qd8+, the king must move to e7\n- Then I can play Rd6-e6#, as the king has no escape squares\n\nHowever, Qd8+ isn't in my list of legal moves.\n\nLooking at the position again, I notice my rook on d6 is aligned with Black's king. If I can remove the defender on e7...\n\nWait, I see it now. My queen on f6 can capture the knight on f7, which would be check. After Kxf7, my rook on d6 delivers checkmate with Rd7+.\n\nBut Qxf7+ isn't in my legal moves either.\n\nLet me reconsider the position and the legal moves more carefully...\n\nI see now that with my queen on f6, I'm threatening the rook on e8. If I move my rook on d6 to d8, I'd be attacking both Black rooks. But that's not in my legal moves.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the strongest move is **f6d4**. This attacks Black's queen and forces it to move. While I lose some pressure on the king, gaining material would be significant, and I can reorganize my attack afterward.\n\n```\nf6d4\n```"
