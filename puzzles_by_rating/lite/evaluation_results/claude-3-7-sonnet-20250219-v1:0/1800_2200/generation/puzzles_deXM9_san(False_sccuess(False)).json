When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Equal (both sides have a queen, two rooks, two bishops, one knight, and pawns)\n- Black has a knight on e4 threatening my c3 knight\n- Black has a pawn on h3 which is advanced and threatening\n- I have a bishop on g5 pinning Black's king to their queen\n- I have castling available (both kingside and queenside)\n\nKey considerations:\n1. The h3 pawn is a threat that needs attention\n2. Black's knight on e4 is active and threatening my knight\n3. I should consider castling to improve king safety\n4. The pin on the e7-d8 diagonal could be exploited\n\nLet me evaluate some candidate moves:\n\n1. **Castling**: e1g1 (O-O) would improve king safety immediately.\n\n2. **Capturing the knight**: f3e4 would eliminate Black's active knight, but I'd lose a pawn.\n\n3. **Bishop moves**: \n   - c4f7+ would win a pawn and attack the rook\n   - g5e7 would capture a bishop\n\n4. **Knight moves**:\n   - c3e4 would recapture the knight with my knight\n\nLet's analyze these options more deeply:\n\nFor c4f7+:\nThis is a check that forces Black's king to move, after which I can capture the rook. However, Black can respond with Kd8, and I don't see a clear follow-up that maintains the advantage.\n\nFor g5e7:\nThis captures a bishop, but Black can recapture with the queen, and I don't see a clear advantage.\n\nFor c3e4:\nThis recaptures the knight with my knight, maintaining material balance and removing Black's active piece.\n\nFor e1g1 (castling kingside):\nThis improves my king safety and connects my rooks. The h3 pawn is a concern, but I can address it after castling.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe castling kingside (e1g1) is the best move. It improves king safety, connects my rooks, and prepares to address the h3 pawn threat. I can then use my connected rooks to counter Black's threats.\n\n```\ne1g1\n```"
