        "content": "I need to analyze this endgame position carefully. I'm playing as White, and I have a king on d4 and a knight on e4. Black has a king on f4 and pawns on f5 and g5.\n\nLet me assess the position:\n- Material is equal (knight vs two pawns)\n- Black's pawns are connected and advanced, which is dangerous\n- My knight is well-positioned, controlling several squares\n- The kings are in close proximity\n\nFirst, I'll check if there are any immediate tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Can I fork the king and a pawn? Looking at knight moves:\n   - e4f6: Doesn't attack anything valuable\n   - e4g5: Captures a pawn but might be recaptured\n   - e4f2: Doesn't create immediate threats\n   - Other knight moves don't create immediate threats\n\n2. King moves:\n   - d4d5: Approaches the pawns but doesn't create immediate threats\n   - d4c4/d4c5/d4d3/d4c3: Move away from the action\n\nThe most critical factor here is stopping Black's pawns. If Black advances these pawns, they could promote. My knight can capture the g5 pawn immediately, which would significantly reduce Black's winning chances.\n\nAfter e4g5, Black would likely play Kxg5, and then I could continue fighting against the single f-pawn.\n\nThis is clearly the most active and decisive move in the position.\n\n```\ne4g5\n```"

Let me break down what we have:\n\nFEN: 8/8/8/5pk1/3K4/8/8/8 w - - 0 56\n\nThis is a king and pawn endgame where:\n- I am playing as White\n- My king is on d4\n- Black's king is on f5\n- Black has a pawn on g5\n- It's my move\n\nThe legal moves for my king are: d4e5, d4d5, d4c5, d4c4, d4e3, d4d3, d4c3\n\nIn this position, Black has a clear advantage with the passed g-pawn. My goal should be to try to stop this pawn from promoting or to force a draw if possible.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate the pawn race situation.\nBlack's g-pawn is already on g5 and will need 4 moves to promote (g5-g4-g3-g2-g1). If I can't capture it or block it effectively, I'll lose.\n\nStep 2: Consider the opposition and king positioning.\nThe key principle in king and pawn endgames is opposition. I need to position my king optimally to either stop the pawn or create counterplay.\n\nStep 3: Analyze each candidate move:\n\n- d4e5: This moves toward both the black king and pawn. It contests the f6 square which could be important for blocking the pawn's advance.\n- d4d5: This moves closer to the pawn but doesn't gain as much ground as e5.\n- d4c5: This moves away from the pawn, which seems counterproductive.\n- d4c4: This moves away from the action entirely.\n- d4e3: This moves backward and away from the pawn.\n- d4d3: This moves backward.\n- d4c3: This moves backward and away from the pawn.\n\nThe most principled move is d4e5, as it approaches both the black king and pawn. By moving to e5, I can contest key squares in front of the pawn and potentially establish opposition against the black king.\n\n```\nd4e5\n```"
