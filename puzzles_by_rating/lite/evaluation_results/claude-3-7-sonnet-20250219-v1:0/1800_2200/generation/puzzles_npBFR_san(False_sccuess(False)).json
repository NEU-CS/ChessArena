When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This suggests we should look for tactical opportunities, possibly even checkmate.\n\nLet's examine our attacking options:\n1. Can we checkmate White's king? The king is on f6, so we need to control escape squares.\n2. Can we use our queen on e1 to deliver check or create threats?\n3. Can we use our knight on c5 to attack White's king?\n\nLooking at the position more carefully, I notice that Black's queen on e1 can deliver check by moving to f2, which would be a discovered check from the rook on d8. This looks very promising.\n\nWith `e1f2`, we deliver check to the White king. The king has limited escape squares:\n- If the king moves to e5, our knight on c5 can capture it\n- If the king moves to g5, our queen can deliver checkmate\n- If the king moves to g6, our queen can also deliver checkmate\n\nThis is a forced checkmate sequence. The queen move to f2 creates a deadly discovered check that leads to checkmate.\n\n```\ne1f2\n```"
