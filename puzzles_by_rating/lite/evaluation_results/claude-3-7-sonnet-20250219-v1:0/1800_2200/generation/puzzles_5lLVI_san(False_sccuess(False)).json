When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position step by step to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, and 7 pawns. Black has a queen, two rooks, two bishops, and 6 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- White's rook on e7 is very active and threatening.\n- Black's king on g8 is potentially vulnerable.\n- Black's queen on b6 and rook on b8 are aligned on the b-file.\n\nKey tactical opportunities:\n1. The rook on e7 can deliver check by moving to e8.\n2. White's queen on a4 is attacking along the a-file and diagonal.\n3. White's bishop on c1 could develop with potential threats.\n\nLet me examine the most promising moves:\n\n**Rook moves:**\n- e7e8+: Immediate check, forcing the king to move. After Kg7, White has no immediate follow-up.\n- e7f7: Threatens the g7 bishop and maintains pressure.\n\n**Queen moves:**\n- a4e8+: Queen check, but after Kh7, no clear follow-up.\n- a4b3: Maintains control but doesn't increase pressure.\n\n**Bishop development:**\n- c1g5: Develops with pressure on h6 pawn.\n- c1f4: Develops with control of central squares.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the strongest move is e7f7, attacking Black's bishop on g7. This maintains the strong rook position and creates a direct threat. Black will likely have to respond to this threat, giving White initiative.\n\n```\ne7f7\n```"
