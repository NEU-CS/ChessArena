Black has two rooks and 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is exposed on a2, while Black's king is on g7.\n- Threats: Black has two rooks on the first rank (a4 and c1), with one directly attacking White's rook on c3.\n- Black has a passed pawn on c2 that's close to promotion.\n\nThe most urgent issue is the passed c2 pawn that's threatening to promote. I need to address this immediately.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. c3c2 - Capturing the dangerous passed pawn\n2. e2c2 - Capturing the dangerous passed pawn with the other rook\n3. c5d3 - Knight move to protect the c-pawn and attack the c1 rook\n\nLooking at c3c2: This captures the dangerous pawn but leaves the rook potentially vulnerable to the c1 rook.\n\nLooking at e2c2: This captures the pawn and simultaneously attacks Black's rook on c1. This seems very strong as it addresses the pawn threat and creates a counter-threat.\n\nLooking at c5d3: This defends against the c2 pawn but doesn't eliminate the immediate threat.\n\nAfter careful analysis, capturing the c2 pawn with e2c2 is clearly the best move. It removes the immediate promotion threat and simultaneously attacks Black's rook on c1, forcing Black to respond to this new threat.\n\n```\ne2c2\n```"

After that exchange, I'd be down a rook and a knight vs a rook, which is a losing position.\n\n**Option 2: c3a3 (capturing the rook with my rook)**\nIf I capture Black's rook on a3 with my rook, Black will likely recapture with the rook on c1 (c1a1), threatening my king. However, I can then play Rc2 to defend against the threat. This maintains material equality (rook and knight vs rook).\n\nThe evaluation is clear: I must capture the rook with c3a3. Moving my king would lose material immediately.\n\n```\nc3a3\n```"
