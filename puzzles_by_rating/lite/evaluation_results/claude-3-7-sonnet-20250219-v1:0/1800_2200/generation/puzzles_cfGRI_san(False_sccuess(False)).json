Let me explore this tactical opportunity.\n\nIf the knight moves to g8, it would be a check, and the king would have to capture it. Then White could play Rc8#, delivering checkmate.\n\nLet's verify this sequence:\n1. Ng8+ Kxg8\n2. Rc8+ Re8 (forced)\n3. Rxe8#\n\nThis is a forced checkmate in 3 moves. The key is starting with the knight check on g8, sacrificing the knight to open the c8-g8 diagonal for the checkmate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7g8\n```"
