When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I'm down significant material (a rook and queen vs my knight).\n- King safety: My king on g1 is relatively safe, but there are potential threats.\n- Piece activity: Black has an active rook on f5 and queen on c7.\n- Pawn structure: I have an advanced e6 pawn that's restricting Black's position.\n- Threats: Black's bishop on d4 is attacking my e3 bishop. Black's rook on f5 could create threats.\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **e3d4**: Capturing the bishop would equalize material slightly, but I'd lose my active bishop.\n2. **e2g4**: Attacking the rook on f5 with the queen could force a retreat or exchange.\n3. **f2f4**: Could challenge Black's control of the center and attack the g4 pawn.\n4. **e3g5**: Moving the bishop to attack h5 pawn might create pressure.\n5. **e3h6**: Bishop move that threatens to enter Black's king position.\n\nAnalyzing the most promising options:\n\n**e2g4** looks strong as it directly attacks the rook on f5. If Black captures with gxf5, I can recapture with the bishop. If the rook moves, I maintain pressure.\n\n**e3d4** would equalize material somewhat, but I'd be trading my active bishop for Black's bishop.\n\n**e3h6** creates a direct threat against Black's king position, potentially setting up mating threats.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the most aggressive and promising move is to attack the rook with my queen:\n\n```\ne2g4\n```"
