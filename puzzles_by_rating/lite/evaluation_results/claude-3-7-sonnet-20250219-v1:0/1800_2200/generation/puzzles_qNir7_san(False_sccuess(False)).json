When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal.\n- King positions: White's king is on e3, Black's king is on c3.\n- Pawn structure: White has pawns on f2 and g4; Black has pawns on b3 and e4.\n- Piece activity: White's rook is active on g5, Black's rook is on c4.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. The position is in the endgame with equal material, so king activity and pawn advancement are crucial.\n2. Black's e4 pawn is advanced and potentially dangerous.\n3. White's g4 pawn could become a passed pawn if advanced.\n\nLet me analyze some candidate moves:\n\n1. **e3f4**: This king move attacks Black's e4 pawn directly. However, after Black defends with Rc4-e4, White hasn't made progress.\n\n2. **f2f4**: This blocks the e4 pawn and secures the f4 square, but it might be premature to commit the pawn structure.\n\n3. **g5e5**: This rook move attacks the e4 pawn directly. Black would need to defend it, perhaps with Rc4-e4, after which White could consider other threats.\n\n4. **g5c5**: This threatens Black's king and b3 pawn simultaneously. Black would need to defend, possibly with Rc4-c5, after which White could capture the e4 pawn.\n\nLooking deeper at g5c5:\n- If Rg5-c5, Black might play Rc4-c5 (exchanging rooks)\n- Then White could capture the e4 pawn with the king\n- This would create a winning pawn endgame for White\n\nThe move g5c5 creates the most concrete threats and forces Black to respond defensively. It threatens both the king and the b3 pawn, creating a tactical opportunity.\n\n```\ng5c5\n```"
