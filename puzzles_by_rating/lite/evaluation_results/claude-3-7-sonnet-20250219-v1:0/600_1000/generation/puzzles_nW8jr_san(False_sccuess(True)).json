When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count: The material appears roughly equal, but White has an active queen on a6 threatening my position\n2. King safety: My king on c8 is under pressure, which explains why I only have one legal move\n3. Threats: White's queen on a6 is threatening checkmate on b7\n\nSince I only have one legal move available (c8b8), I need to understand why this is the case:\n- The white queen on a6 is threatening checkmate on b7\n- Moving my king to b8 is the only way to prevent this immediate checkmate threat\n- No other piece can block or capture the queen in time\n\nGiven that I only have one legal move, I must play:\n\n```\nc8b8\n```\n\nThis move gets my king out of the immediate checkmate threat, though my position remains difficult. After this move, I'll need to find ways to counter White's attack and improve my defensive setup."
