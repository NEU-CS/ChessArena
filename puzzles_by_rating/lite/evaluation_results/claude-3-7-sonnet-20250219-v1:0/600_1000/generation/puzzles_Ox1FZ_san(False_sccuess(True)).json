When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I'm playing as White, and I have very limited legal moves: h2g3 or f2g3.\n\nLet me assess the position:\n\n1) Material count:\n   - White: Queen, 2 Rooks, Knight, 3 Pawns, King\n   - Black: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 3 Pawns, King\n   Material is roughly equal.\n\n2) King safety:\n   - White king on g1 with rook on f1 nearby\n   - Black king on g6 with some pawn protection\n\n3) Piece activity:\n   - Black's rook on g3 and queen on h3 are threatening mate\n   - In fact, I see Black is threatening Qh1# immediately!\n\n4) Legal moves analysis:\n   - h2g3: Captures the rook with a pawn, but leaves the h-file open for Black's queen to deliver mate\n   - f2g3: Captures the rook with a pawn and blocks the h-file diagonal, preventing immediate mate\n\nThe position is extremely critical. Black is threatening an immediate checkmate with Qh1#. I must block this threat.\n\nIf I play h2g3, I capture the rook but leave the h1 square undefended, allowing Black to play Qh1# immediately.\n\nIf I play f2g3, I capture the rook and simultaneously block the diagonal for Black's queen, preventing the immediate checkmate threat.\n\nThe choice is clear - I must play f2g3 to avoid immediate checkmate.\n\n```\nf2g3\n```"
