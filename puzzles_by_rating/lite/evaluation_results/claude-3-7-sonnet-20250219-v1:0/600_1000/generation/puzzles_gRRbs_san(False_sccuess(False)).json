When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This doesn't immediately threaten anything and moves away from the f4 pawn.\n\n2. **f5g5**: Moving the king to the right. This maintains control but doesn't improve White's position significantly.\n\n3. **f5e5**: Moving the king to the left. Similar to g5, doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n4. **f5g4**: Moving the king diagonally toward the f4 pawn. This could be interesting as it attacks the f4 pawn.\n\n5. **f5f4**: Capturing the f4 pawn. This eliminates a Black pawn but needs evaluation.\n\n6. **f5e4**: Moving the king diagonally toward the center. Doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n7. **b4e7**: Bishop captures the knight on e7. This eliminates Black's knight.\n\nLooking at material, White has a king, bishop, and 3 pawns (5 points) while Black has a king, knight, and 3 pawns (6 points). So Black is slightly ahead in material.\n\nThe move **b4e7** stands out as it captures Black's knight, giving White a material advantage. After this capture, White would have 5 points vs Black's 3 points.\n\nAfter b4e7, Black's king would have to recapture (d7e7), and White's king could then advance. This would give White a clear material advantage plus an active king.\n\nThe move **f5f4** (capturing the pawn) is also worth considering, but after analysis, b4e7 is stronger as it wins a knight rather than just a pawn.\n\n```\nb4e7\n```"
