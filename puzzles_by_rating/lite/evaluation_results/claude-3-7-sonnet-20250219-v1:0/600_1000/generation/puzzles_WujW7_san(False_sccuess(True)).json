When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I'm playing as Black, and I need to determine the best move from the given legal moves.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: I (Black) have a queen, rook, bishop, two knights, and several pawns\n- White has a queen, two rooks, two knights, and several pawns\n- White's queen is on g8, directly threatening my king on h8\n- My king is in check, which severely limits my options\n\nLooking at the legal moves provided, I only have one option: f8g8 (moving my rook from f8 to g8).\n\nLet me analyze this move:\n- This would capture White's queen on g8 with my rook\n- This is a forced move since my king is in check and this is the only way to get out of check\n- After capturing the queen, my position would significantly improve as I'd eliminate White's most powerful piece\n\nSince f8g8 is the only legal move and it involves capturing White's queen, it's clearly the best (and only) choice in this position.\n\n```\nf8g8\n```"
