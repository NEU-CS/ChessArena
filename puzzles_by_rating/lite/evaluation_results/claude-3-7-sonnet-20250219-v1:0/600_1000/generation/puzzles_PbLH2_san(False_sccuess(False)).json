When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a rook, bishop, knight, queen, and 8 pawns. Material is even.\n- White has a knight on c6, which is quite advanced and threatening.\n- Black's king is still in the center, and castling is still available.\n- Black's queen on c7 is developed, but several other pieces need development.\n- The white knight on c6 is creating pressure in Black's position.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Development and king safety are priorities\n2. Need to address the knight on c6\n3. Complete development of pieces\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. Castling with `h8g8` would improve king safety immediately.\n2. Developing the bishop with moves like `f8e7` or `f8d6` would be solid.\n3. `c8d7` would develop the bishop and potentially challenge the knight.\n4. `f6d7` would attack the knight on c6, but loses a tempo.\n\nThe knight on c6 is a concern, but it's not immediately threatening anything critical. It can be addressed after improving king safety.\n\nGiven these considerations, I believe castling kingside with `h8g8` is the best move. It immediately improves king safety, which is a priority when the opponent has active pieces. After castling, Black can then address the knight on c6 and continue development with a more secure king position.\n\n```\nh8g8\n```"
