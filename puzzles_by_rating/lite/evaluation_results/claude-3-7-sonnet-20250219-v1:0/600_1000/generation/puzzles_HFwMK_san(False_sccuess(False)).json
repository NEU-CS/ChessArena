When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a bishop, rook, and 4 pawns. White is up a minor piece.\n- King safety: White's king is safe. Black's king is exposed.\n- Piece activity: White has two rooks in very aggressive positions - one on the 7th rank (f7) and one on the e-file (e4).\n\nLooking at the position, I notice Black's king is on c8 with a bishop on b8 and rooks on d8 and h8. This creates an opportunity for a checkmate or decisive material gain.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. e4e8+ - This checks the king, but after Rxe8, we don't gain much.\n2. f7f8+ - This checks the king and attacks the rook on h8.\n3. f7c7+ - This is a discovered check that forces the king to move.\n\nLet's analyze f7c7+:\nAfter Rf7-c7+, Black's king must move. The only square is b8. Then we can play Re4-e8+, and Black must block with Rd8-e8, after which we capture with Rc7xe8+, winning a rook.\n\nLet's analyze f7f8+:\nAfter Rf7-f8+, Black must capture with Rxf8. Then we can play Re4-e8+, which is checkmate!\n\nThe sequence f7f8+ followed by e4e8# is a forced checkmate in 2 moves.\n\n```\nf7f8\n```"
