When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Both sides have roughly equal material (White has R+R+B+N+Q vs Black's R+R+B+N+Q)\n- King safety: Both kings are castled, but Black's king might be more vulnerable\n- Piece activity: White has an active knight on e5, threatening several tactical possibilities\n- Threats: Black's queen on g5 and knight on f4 are creating some pressure\n\nLet me examine the tactical possibilities:\n\n1. Knight captures: The e5 knight has several capture options:\n   - e5f7: Knight fork attacking Black's king and rook\n   - e5d7: Capturing the bishop\n   - e5g4: Capturing the knight on f4\n\n2. Bishop captures:\n   - c2f5: Capturing the knight on f4 (but would lose the bishop to the queen)\n   - c2g6: Attacking the queen and h7 pawn\n\n3. Queen moves:\n   - d2f4: Capturing the knight on f4\n\nLooking at e5f7 more closely - this is a knight fork attacking Black's king and rook. After Nxf7, Black must move the king, and White wins the rook. This is a clear material gain.\n\nThe move e5g4 captures Black's knight but loses the knight to Black's queen.\n\nThe move d2f4 captures Black's knight directly, but might leave the queen exposed.\n\nThe move c2g6 attacks Black's queen, forcing it to move, and threatens the h7 pawn.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the knight fork e5f7 stands out as the strongest move. It forces Black to move the king and allows White to win a rook, gaining significant material advantage.\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
