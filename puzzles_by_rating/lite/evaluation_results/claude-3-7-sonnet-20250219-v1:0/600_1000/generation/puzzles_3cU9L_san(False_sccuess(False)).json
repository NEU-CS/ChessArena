When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

My king is in check from White's knight on f7\n2. White's pawns on d6 and e6 are dangerous and close to promotion\n3. I need to address the check immediately\n\nLet's analyze my options to get out of check:\n- e8f8: Moving the king to f8 is the only way to escape check\n\nAfter e8f8, White could push one of the pawns (likely e6e7+), putting me in check again. I need to see if I can create counterplay.\n\nLet me look at potential counterattacks:\n- My rook on g4 could threaten White's king on f1\n- My knight on e4 has several good squares including f2, which would attack White's king\n\nThe most forcing continuation would be:\n1. e8f8 (escaping check)\n2. e6e7+ (White advances pawn with check)\n3. f8e8 (forced)\n4. e7e8Q+ (White promotes with check)\n\nThis would be losing for me. I need to find a way to create counterplay before White can promote.\n\nAfter e8f8, if I could get my rook to g1 or my knight to f2, I might create checkmate threats against White's king.\n\nLooking at the position more deeply, after e8f8, I could potentially play g4g1 on my next move, threatening checkmate. White would need to deal with this threat before promoting.\n\nGiven the analysis, my best move is to escape check and set up counterplay:\n\n```\ne8f8\n```"
