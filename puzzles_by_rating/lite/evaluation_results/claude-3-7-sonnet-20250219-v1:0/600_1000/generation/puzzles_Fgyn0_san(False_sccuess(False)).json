When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, queen, knight, and 5 pawns. Material is even.\n- King safety: White's king is somewhat exposed with no pieces directly defending it. Black's king has a pawn shield but is also somewhat exposed.\n- Piece activity: Black's queen and knight are actively placed in attacking positions.\n- Threats: Black's queen on e5 and knight on g4 are creating pressure. They could be targeting h2 or f2.\n\nLet me check immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on e5 threatens the e3 pawn\n- Black's knight on g4 could be threatening f2 (though currently protected by the queen)\n- Black could be setting up an attack on White's king\n\nKey candidate moves:\n1. **d2d5** - Trading queens could relieve pressure, but after Qxd5, White loses the e3 pawn\n2. **c5e6** - Knight fork attacking Black's queen and rook\n3. **c1c4** - Activating the rook to defend and counter-attack\n4. **h2h3** - Chasing away the knight on g4\n\nThe move **c5e6** stands out as it forks Black's queen and rook. This would win material as Black can't save both pieces. After 1. Ne6+ Black must choose between losing the queen or the rook.\n\nIf Black moves the king with 1...Kh7, then 2. Nxf8+ wins the rook.\nIf Black moves 1...Kh8, then 2. Nxf8 still wins the rook.\nIf Black moves the queen, then 2. Nxf8 wins the rook.\n\nThis is a clear material gain with no apparent drawbacks.\n\n```\nc5e6\n```"
