When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This doesn't seem to gain much immediate advantage.\n\n**d1d7**:\nThis controls the 7th rank and prepares threats. Black would need to defend against potential threats to the pawns on a7 and b7.\n\n**e3e4**:\nThis attacks the knight on f5, but the knight can simply move away, and White doesn't gain much.\n\n**g2h3**:\nThis threatens to capture the knight on h5. If Black moves the knight, White gains a tempo. If Black doesn't defend, White can capture the knight next move.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the strongest move is to play d1d7, putting pressure on Black's position by controlling the 7th rank and threatening the b7 pawn. This creates immediate threats and restricts Black's options.\n\n```\nd1d7\n```"
