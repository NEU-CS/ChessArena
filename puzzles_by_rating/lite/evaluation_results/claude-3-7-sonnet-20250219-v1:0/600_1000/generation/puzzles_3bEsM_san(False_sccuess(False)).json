When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Both sides have a queen, rook(s), knights, and pawns. White has two rooks vs Black's two rooks.\n- King safety: Both kings are castled, but Black's king might be more exposed with the knight on h7.\n- Piece activity: White has knights on f5 and d2, while Black has knights on f4 and h7.\n- Pawn structure: Relatively even, but White has more central control.\n\nLet's examine the most promising moves:\n\n1. **f5g7**: Knight captures on g7, forking the rook on f8 and the king on g8. This would win material.\n2. **f5h6**: Knight captures the pawn on h6, but doesn't threaten anything immediate.\n3. **f2h4**: Queen move that attacks the knight on f4 and creates threats.\n4. **f2g3**: Queen attacks the knight on f4.\n\nThe move f5g7 stands out as particularly strong. Let's analyze it:\n- After Nxg7, Black must respond to the fork.\n- If Kxg7, White wins the rook on f8.\n- If Black moves the rook, White still has Nxh7 winning material.\n\nThis is a clear tactical opportunity that wins material. The knight sacrifice on g7 forces Black to either lose a rook or face further material loss.\n\nLet me check if there are any better options or if I'm missing anything:\n- No immediate checkmate opportunities\n- No other forks or pins that win more material\n- The knight fork on g7 is the clearest advantage\n\n```\nf5g7\n```"
