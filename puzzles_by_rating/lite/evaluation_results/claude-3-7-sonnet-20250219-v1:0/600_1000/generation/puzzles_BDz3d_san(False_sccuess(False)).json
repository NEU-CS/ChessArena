When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material is even (Black has queen, 2 knights, bishop, 2 rooks, 8 pawns; White has queen, bishop, knight, 2 rooks, 8 pawns)\n- Black's queen is active on e5\n- Black has a pawn on d4 that's advanced\n- White has developed the bishop to f3\n- Black's king hasn't castled yet\n- White's king hasn't castled yet\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Development and king safety\n2. Potential tactics\n3. Control of the center\n4. Piece coordination\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities, I notice that Black's queen on e5 is attacking White's queen on e2. This creates a potential capture, but White's queen is protected by the bishop on f3.\n\nHowever, if Black captures the queen with e5e2, White would recapture with the bishop (f3e2). This would be an unfavorable exchange for Black (trading queen for bishop).\n\nLet's look at development options:\n- Castling (e8c8) would improve king safety\n- Developing the knight (g8f6) would control central squares\n- Developing the bishop (f8e7 or f8d6) isn't available yet\n\nI also notice that the pawn on d4 is undefended. We should consider protecting it or using it tactically.\n\nAfter analyzing the position, I see a strong tactical opportunity: the move e5g3 attacks White's h2 pawn with a fork. If White's king moves to f1, Black can take the h2 pawn. If White defends with g2g3, Black can retreat the queen while maintaining pressure.\n\nThis move creates immediate tactical threats while maintaining our strong central position.\n\n```\ne5g3\n```"
