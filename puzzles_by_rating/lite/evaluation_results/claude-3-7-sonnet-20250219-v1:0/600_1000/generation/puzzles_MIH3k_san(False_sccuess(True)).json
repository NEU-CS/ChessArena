This is an immediate danger that must be addressed.\n\nMy legal moves are only:\n- c1d1: Moving the king to d1\n- c1b1: Moving the king to b1\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nc1d1:\n- This move blocks the f1 rook from defending the e1 square\n- After this move, Black can play Qe1# for an immediate checkmate\n\nc1b1:\n- This move keeps the king safe from immediate checkmate threats\n- The king moves away from the e-file, preventing Qe1#\n- The b1 square is not under attack\n\nThe choice is clear. Moving to d1 allows an immediate checkmate, while b1 keeps the game going and maintains defensive possibilities.\n\n```\nc1b1\n```"
