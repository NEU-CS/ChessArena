When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

So Black is down material (approximately 5 points).\n- King safety: Black's king is exposed in the center while White's king is on b2.\n- Piece activity: Black's rook on g3 is active and potentially threatening.\n\nLet me consider the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **g3g2**: Attacking White's g-pawn and potentially threatening the rook on e2.\n2. **e4e3**: Advancing the passed pawn.\n3. **g3e3**: Rook move threatening the bishop on b3.\n4. **b8b7**: Activating the rook on the 7th rank.\n\nAnalyzing each:\n\n**g3g2**: This attacks White's g-pawn. If White plays Re2-e1 to defend, Black can play Rg2xg-pawn. If White plays g2-g3, Black can consider other threats.\n\n**e4e3**: This advances a passed pawn, but it might be premature as White can attack it with the rook.\n\n**g3e3**: This threatens White's bishop. If White moves the bishop, Black can consider capturing the a4 knight with b6-b5.\n\n**b8b7**: This activates the second rook but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\nThe most forcing and advantageous move appears to be **g3g2**, attacking White's g-pawn and creating immediate pressure. This move forces White to respond to the threat and gives Black tactical opportunities.\n\n```\ng3g2\n```"
