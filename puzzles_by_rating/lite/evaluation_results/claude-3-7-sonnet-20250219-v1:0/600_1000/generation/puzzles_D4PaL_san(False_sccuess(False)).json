When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If White plays Qg6, it creates serious threats.\n\n**f6h4**: This attacks White's queen, but after Qxh4, Black loses the queen for nothing.\n\n**f6g5**: This attacks White's queen and forks it with the f4 pawn. After Qxg5, Black can play fxg5, recapturing the queen. This seems very strong.\n\n**g7g6**: This defends the h7 pawn but weakens the king's position significantly.\n\nAfter careful analysis, f6g5 stands out as the best move. It attacks White's queen and forks it with the f4 pawn. If White captures with Qxg5, Black recaptures with fxg5, winning a queen for a queen. If White retreats the queen, Black has relieved the pressure.\n\n```\nf6g5\n```"
