When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

My rook on c4 is active and could be used for attack\n2. White's rook on a7 is threatening my 7th rank\n3. I need to consider both defensive and offensive possibilities\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **c4c3**: Captures White's pawn, gaining material\n2. **c4h4**: Moves the rook to the h-file, potentially setting up threats against White's king\n3. **f6e5**: Repositions the bishop to a more active diagonal\n4. **f6g5**: Similar to e5, activates the bishop\n\nAnalyzing each option:\n- **c4c3**: This captures a pawn for free, improving my material advantage. After this, White has no immediate threats.\n- **c4h4**: This looks aggressive but doesn't create immediate threats since White's king is safe on h1.\n- **f6e5/g5**: These moves don't seem to create immediate threats or address any pressing issues.\n\nThe move **c4c3** stands out as it gains material without any apparent drawbacks. Capturing the c3 pawn increases my material advantage and strengthens my position.\n\n```\nc4c3\n```"
