When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a king, rook, knight, bishop and 7 pawns. White has a king, 2 rooks, knight, bishop and 7 pawns. So material is even.\n- White's bishop on g5 is pinning Black's knight on e5 to the king.\n- Black's knight on e5 is currently under attack by White's bishop.\n- Black's king is on c8, somewhat exposed.\n\nLet me consider the immediate threats:\n1. White's bishop on g5 is attacking Black's knight on e5.\n2. If the knight moves, White could potentially create threats along the f-file with the rook.\n\nLet me evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. **Move the knight e5**:\n   - e5f7: Knight to f7 escapes the pin and attacks White's rook on d8, but blocks Black's own rook.\n   - e5g6: Knight to g6 escapes the pin but doesn't create any immediate threats.\n   - e5g4: Knight to g4 escapes and could threaten White's king and f2 pawn.\n   - e5f3: Knight to f3 would attack White's king and g1 pawn, but the square is occupied by White's knight.\n   - e5c4: Knight to c4 escapes the pin and could potentially fork pieces later.\n\n2. **Defend the knight**:\n   - f8f7: Rook to f7 defends the knight but blocks the bishop.\n   - g7g6: Pawn to g6 attacks White's bishop.\n\n3. **Counter-attack**:\n   - f8f2: Rook to f2 would attack White's king, but White can simply capture the knight with Bxe5.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the best move is to play g7g6, attacking White's bishop. This forces the bishop to retreat or trade, relieving the pressure on the knight. If White captures the knight with Bxe5, Black can recapture with the pawn (dxe5), maintaining material equality and improving pawn structure.\n\n```\ng7g6\n```"
