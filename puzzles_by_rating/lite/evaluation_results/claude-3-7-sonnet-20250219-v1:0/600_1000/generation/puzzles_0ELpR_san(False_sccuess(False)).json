When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: I have a queen, rook, bishop, knight, and several pawns. Black has a queen, two rooks, bishop, knight, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: My king is on h1, relatively safe. Black's king is on g8.\n- Piece activity: My knight on b5 is attacking Black's queen on c5. My rook on e4 is active.\n- Threats: Black's knight on g4 is threatening my queen on f3.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Black's knight on g4 is threatening my queen on f3\n2. My knight on b5 is threatening Black's queen on c5\n3. There's potential for tactical play on the e-file\n\nLet me examine candidate moves:\n\n1. **b5c7**: Knight fork attacking Black's rook and king. This is a strong tactical move that wins material.\n\n2. **e4g4**: Capturing Black's knight with my rook. This eliminates the threat to my queen but gives up my active rook for a knight.\n\n3. **f3g4**: Capturing Black's knight with my queen. This eliminates the threat but moves my queen to a less active position.\n\n4. **d1d4**: Threatening Black's queen with my rook while defending my queen from the knight.\n\nThe knight fork b5c7 stands out as particularly strong. It attacks both Black's rook on d8 and creates a check to the king. After Black addresses the check, I can capture the rook, winning material.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the knight fork is clearly the best move as it wins material through a tactical combination.\n\n```\nb5c7\n```"
