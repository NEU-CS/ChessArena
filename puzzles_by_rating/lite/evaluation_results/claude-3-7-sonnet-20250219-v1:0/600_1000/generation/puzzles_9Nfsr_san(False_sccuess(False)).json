When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me break down the current state:\n\nFEN: 3Q4/4r1kp/5p2/1pp1q2p/8/6R1/P4PPK/8 b - - 5 36\n\nKey observations:\n- I'm playing as Black\n- Material: White has a queen and rook vs Black's rook and queen\n- My king (g7) is somewhat exposed\n- White's queen is on d8, potentially threatening my rook on e7\n- White's rook is on g3, creating some pressure\n- White's king is on h2, quite safe\n\nLegal moves:\n1. g7f7 - King move to f7\n2. g7h6 - King move to h6\n3. e5g5 - Queen move to g5\n4. e5g3 - Queen captures White's rook on g3\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n1. g7f7: This moves my king away from the h-file but could expose it to checks or attacks.\n\n2. g7h6: This moves my king to the h-file, which could be dangerous with White's rook on g3.\n\n3. e5g5: This repositions my queen but doesn't gain material.\n\n4. e5g3: This captures White's rook with my queen, gaining material. After this capture, White would likely recapture with the f2 pawn, but I would have gained a rook for a pawn, which is a significant material advantage.\n\nThe move e5g3 is clearly the best as it wins material (a rook for a pawn). Even after White recaptures with f2g3, I'll be up a rook, which should be decisive. This is a straightforward decision as gaining material without obvious compensation for the opponent is almost always the best choice.\n\n```\ne5g3\n```"
