When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Move the queen to safety: c6d6, c6e6, c6b6, etc.\n2. Capture White's bishop with the queen: c6d5\n3. Block the bishop's attack with the pawn: c5c4\n4. Develop pieces: b8d7, f5e6, etc.\n\nAnalyzing the best options:\n- c6d5 (capturing the bishop) seems strong as it eliminates the threat and maintains material advantage\n- Moving the queen to safety is reasonable but doesn't gain material\n- Developing pieces is important but addressing the immediate threat is priority\n\nThe move c6d5 stands out as it:\n1. Captures White's bishop (gaining material)\n2. Removes the threat to the queen\n3. Maintains Black's material advantage\n4. Gives the queen a more central position\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is:\n\n```\nc6d5\n```"
