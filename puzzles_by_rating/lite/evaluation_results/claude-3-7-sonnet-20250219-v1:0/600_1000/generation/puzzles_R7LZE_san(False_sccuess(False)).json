When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, rook, knight, and 5 pawns. Material is even.\n- King safety: Black's king is on c8, White's on c1.\n- Piece activity: Black's queen on a4 is active, and the knight on f6 is centralized.\n\nLet me consider tactical opportunities:\n1. Queen moves: The queen on a4 has many options. Let me check for threats or captures.\n   - a4d7 doesn't seem to win material\n   - a4c2 looks interesting - it attacks White's b2 pawn with check\n   - a4d1 would exchange queens but loses the rook on e8\n\n2. Knight moves: The knight on f6 is well-placed but could potentially improve.\n\n3. Rook moves: The rook on e8 doesn't have obvious targets.\n\nLooking at a4c2, this move delivers check and attacks the b2 pawn. White would have to move the king, allowing Black to capture the b2 pawn. This gains material and maintains the attack.\n\nLet's verify there's no better option:\n- No immediate checkmate threats\n- No other material-winning tactics\n- The queen move to c2 gains a pawn with check, which is a clear advantage\n\nThe move a4c2 stands out as the strongest option, giving Black a material advantage and initiative.\n\n```\na4c2\n```"
