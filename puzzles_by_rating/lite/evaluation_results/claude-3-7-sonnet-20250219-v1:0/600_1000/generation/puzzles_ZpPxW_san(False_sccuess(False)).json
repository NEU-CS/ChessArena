When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- White's rook on f7 is threatening Black's position\n- Black's king on g8 is under pressure with White's rook on f7\n- Black's queen on e5 is active and could be used for counterplay\n\nKey threats:\n1. White's rook on f7 threatens mate with Qf6 or Rf8+\n2. Black's queen on e5 is undefended\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **e5f6**: Queen takes the f7 rook. This seems very strong as it removes the immediate threat and captures material.\n\n2. **e6f7**: Bishop takes the f7 rook. This also removes the threat but the queen capture seems better.\n\n3. **e8f8**: Rook blocks potential Rf8+ mate threat.\n\n4. **g8h8**: King moves away from the f-file.\n\nThe move **e5f6** (Queen takes rook on f7) stands out as clearly best because:\n- It captures White's attacking rook\n- It removes the immediate threat\n- It gains material\n- It improves Black's position significantly\n\nAfter Qxf7, Black will be up material and the position will be much safer.\n\n```\ne5f6\n```"
