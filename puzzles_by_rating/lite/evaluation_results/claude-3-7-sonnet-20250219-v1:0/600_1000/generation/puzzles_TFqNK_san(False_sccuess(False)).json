When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I'm playing as White, and I notice I have a significant material advantage with a queen and bishop attacking Black's position.\n\nLet me assess the position:\n1. Material: I have a queen and bishop actively positioned against Black's king\n2. Black's king is exposed on e7\n3. My queen on h5 and bishop on g5 are creating strong pressure\n\nLooking at the legal moves, I see several attacking possibilities:\n\nFirst, let's check for immediate checkmate or decisive attacks:\n- h5f7 (Queen to f7) would be checkmate, as the king on e7 cannot escape\n- h5e8 (Queen captures queen) would win material but miss the checkmate\n- g5f6 (Bishop to f6) would be check but not checkmate\n\nThe move h5f7 delivers immediate checkmate because:\n- The Black king on e7 is attacked by my queen\n- The king cannot capture the queen as it's protected by my bishop on g5\n- The king has no escape squares (d6 and d8 are covered by the bishop, e6 and e8 by the queen, f8 is occupied by Black's bishop)\n- No piece can block the check\n\nThis is a clear case where I can deliver checkmate in one move.\n\n```\nh5f7\n```"
