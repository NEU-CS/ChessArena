When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If Black captures with hxg6, White can play Nxg6 followed by Nxe8, winning material. This looks very promising.\n\n2. **c2f5**: Similar idea, attacking the f6 pawn, but Black can defend with Qe7.\n\n3. **g3h5**: Knight move that attacks the h6 pawn, but doesn't seem as strong as the queen attack.\n\n4. **e1e6**: Rook move that attacks the bishop, but Black can simply retreat the bishop.\n\n5. **b3d5**: Bishop captures pawn, but Black can recapture with cxd5, and White doesn't gain much.\n\nLet me analyze the most promising move c2g6 more deeply:\n- If Black plays hxg6, White plays Nxg6 followed by Nxe8, winning the exchange\n- If Black ignores and plays something else, White can capture on h6, winning a pawn\n- If Black defends with something like Kh7, White still maintains the pressure\n\nThis move creates immediate tactical threats and puts Black under pressure. It's clearly the strongest option among the legal moves.\n\n```\nc2g6\n```"
