When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook, bishop, queen vs Black's rook, rook, queen, knight - material is roughly equal\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe, Black's king is in the corner with limited defenders\n- Piece activity: White's rook on h5 is active and threatening Black's kingside\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have some pawn weaknesses\n\nLooking at the position, I notice White's rook on h5 is attacking Black's kingside, and there's a potential tactical opportunity with the bishop on c4 controlling the f7 square.\n\nLet me examine the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **h5h7**: Capturing the knight on h7 directly. This would win a piece, but I need to check if it's safe.\n   - After h5h7, Black would likely recapture with g6xh7, and White doesn't have an immediate follow-up.\n\n2. **c4f7**: Bishop takes the f7 pawn with check.\n   - This is a key tactical move. After c4f7+, Black's king must move to h8.\n   - Then White can play h5h7, threatening mate with Qh4.\n   - If Black captures the rook with g6xh7, White has Qh4+ leading to mate.\n\n3. **g3h4**: Moving the queen to prepare an attack.\n   - This could set up threats but doesn't have the immediate impact of the other options.\n\nThe combination starting with c4f7+ looks very strong. It creates immediate threats against Black's king and forces Black into a defensive position.\n\nAfter c4f7+, Kh8, h5h7, if Black captures with g6xh7, White has Qh4+ leading to mate. If Black doesn't capture, White threatens Qh4 with a devastating attack.\n\nThis is a clear winning combination for White.\n\n```\nc4f7\n```"
