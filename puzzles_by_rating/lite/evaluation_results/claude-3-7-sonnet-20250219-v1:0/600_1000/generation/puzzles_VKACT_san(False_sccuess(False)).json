When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a rook, bishop, and 5 pawns (including a dangerous g2 pawn). White has a bishop, queen, and 4 pawns.\n- Black's g2 pawn is one step away from promotion\n- Black has two rooks, one on f8 and one on g3\n- Black's bishop on h4 is attacking White's queen on e7\n- White's bishop on d6 is controlling important squares\n\nKey factors:\n1. The g2 pawn is extremely dangerous and close to promotion\n2. Black's rook on g3 is active and putting pressure\n3. Black's bishop on h4 is pinning White's queen to the king\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n1. g3g8 - Moving the rook to g8 with check could be powerful\n2. g3f3 - Attacking White's queen\n3. h4e7 - Capturing White's queen would be decisive if possible\n4. g3g4 - Protecting the bishop and maintaining pressure\n\nLet me analyze the most promising options:\n\ng3g8+: This gives check but after Kh1, Black doesn't have an immediate follow-up.\n\ng3f3: This attacks White's queen, but the queen can simply capture the rook.\n\nh4e7: This would capture White's queen, but I need to check if it's actually possible. Looking at the position, the White queen is on e2, not e7, so this isn't a valid capture.\n\nThe most critical aspect is the g2 pawn that's about to promote. I should focus on either promoting this pawn or creating decisive threats.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the best move appears to be g3g4, protecting the bishop on h4 while maintaining the threat of the g2 pawn's promotion. This creates a connected pair of pieces that control important squares and keeps pressure on White.\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
