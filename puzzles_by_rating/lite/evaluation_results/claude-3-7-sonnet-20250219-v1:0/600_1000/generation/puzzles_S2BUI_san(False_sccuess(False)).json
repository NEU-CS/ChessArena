When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, bishop, rook, and 5 pawns. Material is roughly equal (Q+B vs. R+R+B).\n- King safety: White's king is on h2, somewhat exposed. Black's king is on h8, in the corner.\n- Threats: Black has a rook on e1 that could be dangerous.\n\nLet me analyze the key tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Immediate checkmate possibilities:\n   - Qb6xb8# would be checkmate, as the Black king has no escape squares.\n\n2. Other candidate moves:\n   - Capturing the rook on c7 with Qb6xc7\n   - Other queen moves\n   - Bishop moves\n   - Pawn moves\n\nThe immediate checkmate with Qb6xb8# is clearly the best move. It ends the game immediately in White's favor. No need to consider other options when checkmate is available.\n\n```\nb6b8\n```"
