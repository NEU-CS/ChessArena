When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

However, after Qxd4, Black would lose the knight without adequate compensation.\n\nThe move **g5e3** looks very strong. It directly attacks White's bishop on d3. If White moves the bishop, Black can play Nxe4, winning the queen. If White defends the bishop with Qf3, then Nxe4 would win material.\n\nLet me check for any tactical resources White might have if I play g5e3:\n- If White plays Qf3 to defend the bishop, Nxe4 wins the queen\n- If White moves the bishop, Nxe4 wins the queen\n- If White plays Qxe3, then Nxe3 wins the bishop\n\nI don't see any way for White to adequately defend against this threat. The queen move to e3 creates a powerful double attack that should win material.\n\n```\ng5e3\n```"
