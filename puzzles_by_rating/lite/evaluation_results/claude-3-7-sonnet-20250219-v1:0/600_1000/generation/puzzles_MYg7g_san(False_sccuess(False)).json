When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, bishop, knight, and 5 pawns. Material is equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on c1, relatively safe. Black's king is on a7, also relatively safe.\n- Piece activity: White's queen on f4 is active, bishop on d3 controls diagonals, knight on e2 is centralized.\n- Black's queen on f7 is active, bishop on e6 controls diagonals, knight on e5 is well-placed in the center.\n\nLet me consider tactical opportunities:\n1. Queen moves: The f4 queen has many options. Let's check for immediate threats or captures.\n   - f4f7 would capture Black's queen, which is a major material gain.\n   - f4f8 doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n   - Other queen moves don't appear to offer immediate tactical advantages.\n\n2. Bishop moves: d3a6 would capture a pawn, but might lose the bishop to b7 pawn.\n\n3. Knight moves: No immediate captures or threats.\n\n4. King and pawn moves: No immediate tactical advantages.\n\nThe move f4f7 stands out as it captures Black's queen, which would give White a decisive material advantage. Let's verify there are no hidden tactics that would make this capture disadvantageous:\n- After Qxf7, Black has no immediate threats or captures.\n- White would be up a queen for no compensation.\n\nThis is a straightforward decision - capturing the opponent's queen when it's undefended is almost always the best move.\n\n```\nf4f7\n```"
