If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a rook, a knight, and 2 pawns.\n- Material count: Black has approximately 8 points (bishop=3, rook=5) vs White's 8 points (knight=3, rook=5)\n- King safety: Black's king is on b6, White's king is on d3\n- Pawn structure: Black has connected pawns on d5 and e5, plus an a5 pawn. White has pawns on a4 and b5.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Black's rook on f2 is very active and threatening\n2. White's rook on g6 is also active\n3. Material is roughly equal, but Black's position seems more active\n\nLet me consider the candidate moves:\n\nFor the rook moves:\n- `f2f8`, `f2f7`, `f2f6`, `f2f5`, `f2f4`, `f2f3` are all horizontal moves that don't seem to create immediate threats\n- `f2h2`, `f2g2`, `f2e2`, `f2d2`, `f2c2` are lateral moves\n- `f2f1` moves the rook back\n\nFor the bishop moves:\n- `b6c7`, `b6b7`, `b6a7`, `b6c5` all move the bishop\n\nFor the pawn moves:\n- `e5e4` advances the e-pawn\n- `d5d4` advances the d-pawn\n\nThe most promising moves appear to be:\n1. `f2c2` - attacking White's knight directly\n2. `d5d4` - advancing a pawn toward White's king\n3. `e5e4` - advancing a pawn toward White's king\n\nLooking at `f2c2`, this directly attacks White's knight on c2. If White moves the knight, Black can continue advancing pawns. If White defends with the king, Black can advance pawns to create passed pawns.\n\nThe move `f2c2` stands out as the strongest as it creates an immediate threat against White's knight, forcing White to respond defensively rather than creating threats of their own.\n\n```\nf2c2\n```"
