When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White is up material (queen = 9 points vs rook = 5 points).\n- King safety: White's king is exposed on h1, while Black's king is on a8.\n- Black has two rooks on e2 and e8, creating threats.\n- The rook on e2 is particularly dangerous, threatening White's back rank.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Black's rook on e2 is threatening checkmate on h2 or e1.\n2. I need to either neutralize this threat or create a stronger counterattack.\n3. My queen is well-positioned on g5 with many attacking options.\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n1. Direct checkmate options: The queen can deliver checkmate with g5g8.\n2. Defensive moves: Using the rook to block the e-file.\n3. Counter-attacking moves: Using the queen to attack Black's pieces.\n\nLet me check g5g8:\nIf I play Qg8#, this is an immediate checkmate as the Black king on a8 has no escape squares and my queen on g8 delivers check.\n\nThis is clearly the best move as it ends the game immediately with a win for White. No need to consider other options when checkmate is available.\n\n```\ng5g8\n```"
