When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the material and positional factors first.\n\nMaterial count:\n- Black: Rook (a5), Rook (c8), Knight (d5), 5 pawns\n- White: Rook (b1), Rook (e1), Knight (d6), Bishop (c4), 6 pawns\n\nMaterial is roughly even, with Black having an extra pawn but White having better piece activity.\n\nKey positional elements:\n1. White's knight on d6 is threatening my king position\n2. My knight on d5 is well-placed and could be powerful\n3. White's bishop on c4 is controlling important diagonals\n4. My king on f6 is somewhat exposed\n5. My rook on a5 is active but could be better utilized\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves from d5**:\n   - d5e3 attacks White's king on c2, creating a fork with the f2 pawn\n   - d5c3 would fork White's king and a-pawn\n   - d5f4 would protect my g-pawn and control central squares\n\n2. **King moves**:\n   - f6g6 or f6e7 to improve king safety\n\n3. **Rook moves**:\n   - a5a6 to control the 6th rank\n   - c8d7 to activate the rook\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities, I notice that d5e3+ is a knight fork of White's king and f2 pawn. This is a powerful tactic that would win material.\n\nLet me double-check this move: Knight from d5 to e3 would check White's king on c2 while also attacking the pawn on f2. After the king moves, I can capture the f2 pawn.\n\nThis is clearly the strongest move in the position, gaining material with a tactical blow.\n\n```\nd5e3\n```"
