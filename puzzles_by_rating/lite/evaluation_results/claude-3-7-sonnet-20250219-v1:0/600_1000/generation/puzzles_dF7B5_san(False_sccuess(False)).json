When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the current state of the board:\n\n1) Material count:\n   - Black: 1 rook on g8, 1 rook on g6, king on b6, and 4 pawns (a7, b5, h6, e5)\n   - White: 2 rooks (c7, c2), king on g1, and 4 pawns (a3, b4, e4, g2)\n   \n   Material is even with 2 rooks each and 4 pawns each.\n\n2) King safety:\n   - My king on b6 is somewhat exposed\n   - White's king on g1 is safe\n\n3) Piece activity:\n   - White's rook on c7 is very active and threatening\n   - My rooks are not coordinated optimally\n\n4) Immediate threats:\n   - White's rook on c7 is threatening to capture my a7 pawn\n   - If I lose the a7 pawn, White will have a dangerous passed pawn\n\nLet me consider my options:\n\n1) Defending the a7 pawn:\n   - a7a6: Defends the pawn but leaves my king with less mobility\n   - a7a5: Advances the pawn but might be captured by White's rook\n\n2) Rook moves:\n   - Moving g8 rook: Doesn't address immediate threats\n   - Moving g6 rook: Could potentially create counterplay\n\nThe most critical issue is defending the a7 pawn. If I lose it, White will have a strong passed pawn. \n\nLooking at g6 rook moves, I could consider g6c6 to defend the a-pawn while also putting pressure on White's rook on c7. This would force White to move the rook, giving me time to improve my position.\n\nWith g6c6, I defend my a7 pawn while simultaneously threatening White's rook on c7. This creates counterplay and addresses my most immediate concern.\n\n```\ng6c6\n```"
