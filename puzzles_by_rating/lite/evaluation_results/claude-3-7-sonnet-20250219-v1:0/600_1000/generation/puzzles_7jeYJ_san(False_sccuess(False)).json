When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook, queen, knight, and 5 pawns. Black has a queen, rook, bishop, and 5 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is exposed on h1 with Black's queen on d1 threatening check.\n- Piece activity: White's rook is active on c7, threatening Black's pawn structure.\n- Threats: Black's queen on d1 and rook on d2 are creating serious threats.\n\nThe most pressing issue is that Black's queen on d1 is threatening White's king. Black's rook on d2 is also very active and threatening. I need to address these immediate threats.\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n1. **f2d2**: Capturing Black's rook with the queen would eliminate a threat.\n2. **c7g7**: Capturing Black's pawn with check could force the king to move.\n3. **f2g1**: Moving the queen to protect the king from potential checks.\n\nLet's analyze these options:\n\n**f2d2** (Queen takes rook):\nThis eliminates Black's rook threat, but after Black recaptures with Qxd2, White's position remains precarious with the queen threatening the king.\n\n**c7g7+** (Rook takes pawn with check):\nThis forces Black's king to h8, and creates an immediate threat. This looks very strong as it attacks the king directly.\n\n**f2g1** (Queen protects king):\nThis is defensive and doesn't address White's need to counter-attack.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the strongest move is c7g7+, giving check and creating immediate threats against Black's king. This forces Black to respond to the check and gives White the initiative.\n\n```\nc7g7\n```"
