This suggests I'm in a very difficult position, possibly losing.\n\nLet me evaluate each move:\n\ng1h1:\n- Moves the king to the corner\n- Slightly more protected position\n- Still vulnerable to potential attacks\n\ng1f1:\n- Moves the king toward the center\n- Could potentially support pieces in the center\n- Might be more exposed to checks\n\nSince I have such limited options and am likely in a losing position, I need to choose the move that gives me the best chance to survive. The h1 square seems slightly safer as it's in the corner and less exposed.\n\n```\ng1h1\n```"
