When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen on b7 which is very active and threatening.\n- White's queen on b7 is putting pressure on Black's position, particularly threatening the rook on a8.\n- Black's pieces are somewhat undeveloped, with the king still in the center.\n- White has advanced a pawn to g5, which is quite aggressive.\n\nLet me consider the immediate threats:\n1. White's queen on b7 threatens the a8 rook\n2. White's knight on g5 is putting pressure on Black's kingside\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. **d8e7** - Moving the queen to protect the a8 rook and develop\n2. **h5f7** - Moving the knight to f7 to protect the kingside\n3. **c5d4** - Attacking White's pawn on e4 with the bishop\n4. **g8e7** - Developing the knight to a more active square\n5. **f8e7** - Developing the bishop\n\nLet's analyze these candidates:\n\n**d8e7**: This protects the a8 rook from the queen's attack and develops the queen to a more active square. However, it blocks the development of the f8 bishop.\n\n**h5f7**: This knight move protects the kingside but doesn't address the immediate threat to the a8 rook.\n\n**c5d4**: This bishop move attacks White's e4 pawn, but after exd4, Black loses a bishop for a pawn, which is a bad trade.\n\n**g8e7**: This develops the knight but doesn't address the immediate threat to the a8 rook.\n\n**f8e7**: This develops the bishop but doesn't address the immediate threat to the a8 rook.\n\nI need to address the immediate threat to the a8 rook. The best options are:\n- **d8e7** (Queen protects rook)\n- **a8b8** (Rook moves away from threat)\n- **a8c8** (Rook moves away from threat)\n\nOf these, **d8e7** seems strongest as it both protects the rook and develops the queen to a more active square. It also helps secure the kingside against the knight on g5.\n\n```\nd8e7\n```"
