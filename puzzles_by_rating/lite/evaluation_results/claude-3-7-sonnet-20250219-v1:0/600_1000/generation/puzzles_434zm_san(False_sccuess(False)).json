When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a powerful attack with the queen on h4 and rook on e3 directly threatening my king on f2. I need to evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. f2g1: Moving my king to g1 gets away from the e-file threat from Black's rook on e3, but might still be vulnerable to other attacks.\n\n2. f2f1: Moving my king to f1 stays on the same file as Black's rook on e3, which seems dangerous.\n\n3. g2g3: This pawn move would attack Black's queen on h4, but might weaken my king's position further.\n\nLooking more deeply, I notice that Black's rook on e3 is directly attacking my king. If I move to f1, I'm still in the line of attack. If I move to g1, I escape the rook's attack. The g2g3 move would attack Black's queen but might create weaknesses around my king.\n\nGiven the immediate threat from the rook on e3, I need to get my king out of that line of attack. Moving to g1 accomplishes this and seems safest.\n\n```\nf2g1\n```"
