When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I must address this threat immediately.\n\nLet's analyze each legal move:\n\n1. **d2d1**: King moves to d1, escaping the check. However, this leaves my king potentially vulnerable to other attacks.\n\n2. **d2c1**: King moves to c1, also escaping the check. Similar concerns as d2d1.\n\n3. **g4e2**: Queen moves to e2, blocking the check by interposing between Black's queen and my king. This also threatens Black's queen with capture.\n\n4. **e1e2**: Rook moves to e2, blocking the check. However, this loses the rook as Black's queen can capture it.\n\nComparing these options:\n- e1e2 loses a rook immediately, so it's clearly bad\n- d2d1 and d2c1 both escape check but don't counter-attack\n- g4e2 both blocks the check AND threatens Black's queen, forcing Black to retreat or exchange queens\n\nThe move g4e2 is clearly best as it addresses the check while creating a threat of my own. If Black exchanges queens, I'll be up material after recapturing with my king.\n\n```\ng4e2\n```"
