When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, rook, rook, knight, and 7 pawns (28 points)\n- Black has a queen, two rooks, bishop, knight, and 6 pawns (29 points)\n- So material is roughly equal, with Black having a slight advantage\n\nKey observations:\n1. White's queen on b7 is attacking Black's a8 rook\n2. White's knight on e5 is well-positioned and threatening several squares\n3. Black's queen on d5 is attacking White's rook on e3\n4. Black's king on g8 has limited protection\n\nLet me consider tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Capturing the rook with Qxa8: This wins a rook, but after Rxc8+, White would need to ensure there's no dangerous counterplay.\n\n2. Queen moves that maintain pressure: Qf7+ looks interesting as it attacks the king and the g6 knight simultaneously.\n\n3. Knight moves: Ne5xf7 would fork Black's king and rook.\n\nLet's examine the knight fork Ne5xf7:\n- After Nxf7, Black's king must move\n- If Kh7, White has Qxc8 winning a rook\n- If Kh8, White has Qxc8 winning a rook\n- If Kf8, White has Qxc8+ followed by Nxd5 winning the queen\n\nThis looks very strong. The knight fork on f7 wins material and creates a decisive advantage.\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
