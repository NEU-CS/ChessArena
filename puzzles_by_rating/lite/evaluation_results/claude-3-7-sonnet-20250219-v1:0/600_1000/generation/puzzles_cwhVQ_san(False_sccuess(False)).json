When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The bishop on d3 is a direct threat that needs to be addressed\n2. Black's queen on g5 could be targeting my kingside\n3. I need to improve my piece activity and coordination\n\nLet's examine the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **c2d3**: Recapturing the bishop with my queen seems most natural\n   - This immediately regains material equality\n   - Controls the d3 square which is important in the center\n   - Removes the immediate threat\n\n2. **e1e8**: Trading rooks\n   - This would simplify the position but doesn't address the bishop on d3\n   - After Black recaptures with their rook, I'm still down material\n\n3. **c1g5**: Developing the bishop with a threat to the queen\n   - Forces Black's queen to move\n   - But leaves the d3 bishop untouched, remaining down material\n\nThe most pressing issue is the bishop on d3, and the most direct solution is to recapture it with my queen. This restores material balance and removes the immediate threat.\n\n```\nc2d3\n```"
