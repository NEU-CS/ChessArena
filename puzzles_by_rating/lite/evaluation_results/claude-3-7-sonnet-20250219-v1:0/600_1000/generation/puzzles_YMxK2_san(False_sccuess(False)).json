When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Development and king safety are priorities in this middlegame position\n2. The pin on c3 is valuable but not immediately decisive\n3. Castling would improve king safety for Black\n\nLet's evaluate the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **e8g8** (castling kingside): This gets the king to safety and connects the rooks, a priority in the middlegame.\n\n2. **b4c3**: Capturing the knight would win a piece, but I don't see this in the legal moves list, suggesting White has protection for the knight.\n\n3. **f6e4**: Attacking the center with the knight and potentially threatening the queen.\n\n4. **b4c5/d6**: Retreating the bishop while maintaining influence.\n\n5. **f6d5**: Centralizing the knight to a strong square.\n\nAfter careful consideration, castling kingside (e8g8) appears to be the best move. It immediately addresses king safety, which is crucial at this stage of the game. The king is vulnerable in the center, and castling connects the rooks, improving coordination of Black's pieces.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
