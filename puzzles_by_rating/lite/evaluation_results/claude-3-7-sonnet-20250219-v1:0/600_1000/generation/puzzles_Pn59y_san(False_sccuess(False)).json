When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White is up significant material.\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe, while Black's king is in the corner with some pawn protection.\n- Threats: Black's queen on a5 is active but not immediately threatening.\n- Special opportunities: White's knight on e7 and rook on b7 are well-positioned for potential attacks.\n\nLooking at the position, I notice that White has a powerful knight on e7 that can deliver a checkmate by moving to g8. Let me verify this:\n\nIf e7g8, the knight would be attacking the Black king on h8, and the king has no legal moves:\n- h8g8 is not possible as the knight would be there\n- h8h7 is not possible as it would still be in check from the knight\n- No other piece can block or capture the knight\n\nThis is a clear checkmate opportunity!\n\nLet me double-check if there are any other forcing moves that might be even stronger, but an immediate checkmate should be the best option.\n\n```\ne7g8\n```"
