When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a rook, queen, and 5 pawns.\n- Black's king is exposed on a8 with a rook on d8 and g8\n- White's queen on f7 is threatening Black's position\n- Black's queen on h4 is active but potentially vulnerable\n- White has a pawn on d4 and e3\n\nKey threats:\n1. White's queen on f7 is threatening checkmate on a7\n2. Black's queen on h4 is attacking White's kingside\n\nLooking at defensive moves first:\n- The immediate threat is White's queen on f7 threatening mate on a7\n- I need to either block this threat or counter with a stronger threat\n\nExamining counterattack possibilities:\n- Black's queen on h4 could potentially deliver a strong attack\n- The knight on d5 could be repositioned for attack or defense\n\nLet me check specific candidate moves:\n1. `h4h1+`: Queen check on h1 - but White can block with Rf1-h1\n2. `h4h2`: Queen attacking f2 pawn - creates a strong threat\n3. `d5f6`: Knight attacking the White queen - this could force White to retreat\n4. `d5e3`: Knight capturing pawn with check - this creates immediate pressure\n\nThe move `d5e3` stands out as particularly strong - it captures a pawn with check, forcing White's king to move and relieving the pressure from White's queen.\n\n```\nd5e3\n```"
