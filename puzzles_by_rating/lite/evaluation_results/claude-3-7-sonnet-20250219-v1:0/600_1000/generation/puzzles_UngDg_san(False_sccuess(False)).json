When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. **d5d6**: Moving the king up. This abandons control of the e5 pawn, allowing Black's king to capture it. Not good.\n\n2. **d5c6**: Moving the king diagonally away from Black's king and pawns. This also loses control of the e5 pawn.\n\n3. **d5c5**: Moving the king to the left. This maintains some control over e5 but gives Black's king more space.\n\n4. **d5c4**: Moving the king down-left. This loses control of e5 and doesn't make progress.\n\n5. **d3d4**: Advancing the d-pawn. This strengthens White's position by controlling more space and potentially creating a passed pawn.\n\nThe key insight is that in king and pawn endgames, pawn advances are often decisive. By playing d3d4, White creates a potential passed pawn that could promote. This move also maintains the king's position to contest Black's pawns.\n\nAfter d3d4, if Black captures the e5 pawn with the king, White can advance the d-pawn further. If Black defends the e5 pawn, White can maneuver the king to make progress.\n\nThe best move is:\n\n```\nd3d4\n```"
