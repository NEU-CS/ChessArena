When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The material count shows:\n- White: Queen, 2 Rooks, Knight, Bishop, 7 Pawns\n- Black: Queen, 2 Rooks, Knight, Bishop, 7 Pawns\n\nSo material is even, but let's look at the position more deeply:\n\n1. Black has a bishop on h2 that's attacking my g1 square where my king sits, which explains why my only legal moves are king moves.\n2. Black's pieces are well coordinated - rooks on e6 and e8, queen on d6, knight on f6.\n3. My knight on a4 and bishop on h4 are somewhat active, but my position is precarious due to the bishop check.\n\nLet me evaluate the two legal moves:\n\n**Option 1: g1h1**\nMoving to h1 puts my king in the corner. This might seem safer, but it could restrict my king's mobility. The h1 square is currently not under attack.\n\n**Option 2: g1f1**\nMoving to f1 keeps my king more centralized. The f1 square is also not under attack currently.\n\nKey considerations:\n- After either move, Black's bishop will likely retreat.\n- I need to consider which king position gives me better defensive prospects and counterplay opportunities.\n- The f1 square keeps my king more centralized and potentially more active.\n- The h1 square might be slightly safer in the corner but more restricted.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe g1f1 is slightly better as it keeps my king more centralized, which could be important for defense and potential counterplay. The f1 square also gives my king more escape squares compared to the h1 corner.\n\n```\ng1f1\n```"
