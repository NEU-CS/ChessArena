When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If I can prevent castling or exploit the king's central position, that would be advantageous.\n\nThe move c3d5 (knight takes pawn) looks tempting. If Black recaptures with cxd5, White can play e3e4 attacking the d5 pawn. If Black recaptures with Nxd5, White can play Qxd5 gaining material.\n\nAnother strong option is b3b7 (queen takes pawn), which directly wins material. However, I need to check if this is safe.\n\nAfter b3b7, Black could play Nd5 attacking the queen. White would need to retreat, and Black would have gained tempo. This seems risky.\n\nThe move e3e4 strengthens White's center and challenges Black's d5 pawn. This looks strategically sound.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe c3d5 (knight captures pawn on d5) is the strongest move. It wins material and creates tactical threats while improving White's position.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
