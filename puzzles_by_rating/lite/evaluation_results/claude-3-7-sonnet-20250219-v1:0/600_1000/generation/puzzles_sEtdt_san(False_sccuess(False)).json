When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: I have a queen and bishop vs. opponent's two rooks and queen\n- My king is exposed with the opponent's queen and rook nearby\n- The opponent's king is also somewhat exposed\n- There appears to be potential for an attack\n\nLet me check for immediate threats:\n- Black's queen on f6 and rook on f2 are threatening my position\n- The rook on f2 is particularly dangerous, attacking my f1 rook\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n1. **Capturing the f2 rook**: `f1f2` would eliminate the immediate threat, but after Black recaptures with `f6f2`, I'd lose my rook for a rook.\n\n2. **Queen moves for attack**: \n   - `c7g7` threatens checkmate on h8\n   - `c7f7` also threatens the king's position\n\n3. **Bishop moves**: \n   - `c4f7` would attack the queen and rook simultaneously\n\nLet me analyze the most promising options:\n\n`c7g7`: This move threatens immediate checkmate. Black would be forced to capture with `g8g7`, after which I could play `c4f7+` forking the king and queen. This looks very strong.\n\n`c4f7`: This attacks both the queen on f6 and rook on f8. If Black's queen moves, I can capture the rook. If the rook moves, I can capture the queen. This creates a powerful fork.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe `c7g7` is the strongest move as it forces Black to give up material to prevent immediate checkmate, and leads to a winning position.\n\n```\nc7g7\n```"
