When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The most immediate concern is White's pressure on f7 with both bishop and queen\n2. I need to develop pieces and secure my king\n3. The a4 pawn is somewhat exposed and may need attention\n\nLet's analyze candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight development**:\n   - g8f6 develops with tempo by attacking e4\n   - g8h6 is less active\n\n2. **Bishop development**:\n   - f8g7 completes the kingside fianchetto, which works well with g6\n   - f8h6 is unusual and less effective\n\n3. **Defending f7**:\n   - e7e6 would protect f7 and open lines for bishop development\n   - Alternatively, I could develop the knight to f6 which indirectly helps defend\n\n4. **Central control**:\n   - e7e5 would contest the center but might leave f7 vulnerable\n   - d7d5 challenges White's center control\n\nAfter analyzing the position, I believe the best move is f8g7. This completes the kingside fianchetto, develops a piece, and prepares for castling. The bishop on g7 will exert pressure on the long diagonal and support future central play.\n\n```\nf8g7\n```"
