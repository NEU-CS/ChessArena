When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, rook, and 6 pawns. Material is even.\n- King safety: White's king is somewhat exposed with the black queen on c4.\n- Threats: Black's queen on c4 is threatening White's position. Black's rook on e6 is active.\n- Special features: Black has a passed d3 pawn which is dangerous.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. The d3 pawn is a serious threat that could promote\n2. Black's queen on c4 is attacking White's position\n3. White needs to address these immediate threats\n\nLet's analyze the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **d1d3**: Capturing the passed pawn with the rook eliminates the immediate threat of promotion. This seems very strong as it removes Black's dangerous passed pawn.\n\n2. **e3d3**: Taking the pawn with the queen also works, but the rook capture seems better as it keeps the queen active.\n\n3. **e3c5**: This move attacks Black's queen, forcing it to move, but Black's queen can retreat and the d3 pawn remains a threat.\n\n4. **e3e6**: Trading queens simplifies the position but leaves the d3 pawn still threatening.\n\nThe most urgent issue is the passed d3 pawn. Capturing it with the rook (d1d3) is the most direct solution and maintains White's queen for attacking possibilities.\n\n```\nd1d3\n```"
