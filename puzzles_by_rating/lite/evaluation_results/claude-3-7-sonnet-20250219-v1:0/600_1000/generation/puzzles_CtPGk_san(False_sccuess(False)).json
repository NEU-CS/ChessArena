When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has two rooks and pawns. Material is roughly equal (9 points for White's queen vs. 10 points for Black's two rooks).\n- White's queen on e5 is attacking Black's rook on e8.\n- White's bishop on e3 controls the a7-g1 diagonal.\n- White's rook on d1 controls the d-file.\n- Black's king on g8 seems relatively safe.\n- Black has two rooks that could potentially coordinate.\n\nImmediate threats:\n- White's queen is threatening Black's rook on e8.\n\nLet's consider the candidate moves:\n\n1. Protecting the e8 rook:\n   - c7e7 (moving the c7 rook to e7) would defend the e8 rook.\n   - g8f8 would move the king to defend the e8 rook.\n\n2. Moving the threatened rook:\n   - e8e7, e8e6, etc. would move the rook away from the queen's attack.\n\n3. Counter-attacking:\n   - c7c1+ would attack White's king, but White can block with Rd1.\n\nThe most promising idea seems to be to coordinate the rooks. If I can get both rooks working together, I might create strong threats.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the best move is to move the c7 rook to e7, protecting the other rook and creating a connected rook pair on the e-file, which could lead to strong pressure.\n\n```\nc7e7\n```"
