When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is exposed with Black's queen on h3 and knight on h4 threatening the kingside.\n- Threats: Black's queen on h3 and knight on h4 are creating serious threats against White's king.\n- This is a critical position where White needs to address the immediate threats.\n\nThe most pressing issue is the Black queen on h3 and knight on h4 targeting White's kingside. This is a dangerous attack that must be addressed immediately.\n\nLet's consider candidate moves:\n1. **h2g4**: Captures the knight on h4, removing one attacker.\n2. **d1h5**: Queen move that threatens Black's queen while also defending against mate threats.\n3. **f2f3**: Blocks the queen's attack but doesn't address the knight.\n4. **c1h6**: Bishop move that attacks the g7 pawn but doesn't address immediate threats.\n\nLooking at h2g4, this captures the knight on h4, removing one of the attackers. However, after Qxg4+, White would be in serious trouble.\n\nThe move d1h5 looks very strong as it:\n- Directly threatens Black's queen on h3\n- Defends against immediate checkmate threats\n- Forces Black to retreat or trade queens, relieving pressure\n\nAfter d1h5, if Black plays Qxh5, White can recapture with Nxh5, and the immediate danger is gone. If Black retreats the queen, White has gained time and relieved the pressure.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the best move is:\n\n```\nd1h5\n```"
