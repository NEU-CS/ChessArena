When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This seems dangerous.\n\n2. **c6b6** (King to b6): This moves my king away from the bishop's attack, but leaves it somewhat exposed on the queenside.\n\n3. **c6b5** (King to b5): This moves my king to a more exposed position and could be dangerous.\n\n4. **d8d5** (Queen captures pawn on d5): This captures a pawn but puts my queen in a position where it could be captured by White's pieces.\n\n5. **e7d5** (Knight captures pawn on d5): This captures the d5 pawn with my knight, removing a central pawn and developing my knight to a better position.\n\nLooking at the position more deeply:\n- The bishop on e6 is a major threat to my king\n- Capturing the d5 pawn with either queen or knight would remove this central pawn\n- The knight capture (e7d5) seems safer than the queen capture\n\nThe move **e7d5** (Knight captures d5) appears best because:\n- It captures a central pawn\n- It develops my knight to a better position\n- It doesn't expose my queen to potential capture\n- It creates a threat in the center\n\n```\ne7d5\n```"
