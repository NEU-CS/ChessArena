When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, and 7 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Piece activity:\n   - My bishop on g4 is pinning White's knight on f3 to their queen on d4\n   - I have a bishop on d6 that's currently undefended\n   - My queen and rooks are not very active yet\n\n3. Threats:\n   - White's queen on d4 is threatening my bishop on d6\n   - White's bishop on c3 is on the a1-h8 diagonal\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **g4f3**: Capturing the knight would win a piece, but White's queen would recapture, and I'd lose my bishop.\n\n2. **d8h4**: This queen move attacks White's queen while defending my bishop on d6. If White's queen captures my bishop, I can capture their queen. This looks promising.\n\n3. **d6e5**: Moving my bishop to safety, but this seems passive.\n\n4. **e8e4**: Rook to e4 attacks White's queen, but White can simply capture my bishop on d6 with check.\n\n5. **g4h3**: Retreating the bishop, but this seems passive and allows White to capture on d6.\n\nLet me analyze **d8h4** more deeply:\n- It defends my bishop on d6\n- It attacks White's queen\n- It creates a potential discovered attack with my bishop on g4 if White's knight moves\n- If White captures on d6 with the queen, I capture their queen with mine\n- If White moves their queen, my bishop on g4 remains pinning their knight\n\nThis move seems to solve my immediate problem of the hanging bishop while creating counterplay.\n\n```\nd8h4\n```"
