When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook, bishop, knight, queen, and pawns. Black has a rook, bishop, queen, and pawns.\n- King safety: White's king is on h1, somewhat exposed. Black's king is on g8, also somewhat exposed.\n- Threats: Black's queen on h3 is threatening White's king area. White's queen on g5 is active.\n\nLet me check for immediate tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Checkmate threats:\n   - The most promising idea seems to be using the queen on g5 to deliver checkmate.\n   - Qg5-h6 looks very strong as it threatens mate on g7.\n\n2. Looking at Qg5-h6:\n   - After Qh6, Black's only defense would be to move the queen to block on g7 or h7.\n   - If Black plays Qh3-g7, White can capture with Qh6xg7#.\n   - If Black plays Qh3-h7, White can capture with Qh6xh7#.\n\n3. Other candidate moves:\n   - Promoting the pawn with a7-a8=Q is tempting but not immediate mate.\n   - Moving the rook on f1 to attack the black queen is too slow.\n\nThe move Qg5-h6 creates an unstoppable checkmate threat. Black's queen cannot defend both g7 and h7 simultaneously, and there are no other pieces that can block effectively.\n\n```\ng5h6\n```"
