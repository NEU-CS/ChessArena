When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is even.\n- White has a powerful rook on e7, deep in Black's territory\n- Black's queen on a4 is active but not immediately threatening\n- Black's king on g8 appears vulnerable with the White rook on e7\n\nLet me look for tactical opportunities:\n\n1. Immediate checkmate threats:\n   - Re8# would be checkmate, but Black's rook on c8 prevents this\n   - Qf7# would be checkmate, but Black's king can capture\n\n2. Forcing sequences:\n   - Rxf7 followed by Qf7# looks promising if Black's king captures the rook\n\nLet's analyze the move Rxf7 (e7f7):\n- If Kxf7, then Qf7# is checkmate\n- If Black doesn't capture with Kxf7, White has won a pawn and maintains the attack\n\nThis is a clear forcing sequence that either leads to checkmate or material gain while maintaining the attack.\n\nOther candidate moves like Qf7+ directly would allow Rxf7, and Re8+ would be blocked by Rxe8.\n\nThe move e7f7 (Rxf7) creates an immediate threat that Black cannot adequately defend against. It's a decisive move that either leads to checkmate or significant material advantage.\n\n```\ne7f7\n```"
