When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Checkmate opportunities\n2. Material threats\n3. Pawn promotion potential\n4. Defensive needs\n\nLet me check for immediate tactical opportunities:\n\nThe bishop on c4 controls the f1 square, which is adjacent to White's king. If I can deliver a check with the bishop while supporting a mating attack, that could be decisive.\n\nLooking at the move c4f1, this would check the White king. After the king moves (likely to g1), I could potentially follow up with e3e2 and then e2e1Q for promotion.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider advancing the e-pawn immediately with e3e2, threatening promotion.\n\nLet me also check if there are any immediate threats from White that I need to address.\n\nWhite's queen on a5 and rook on f5 are active pieces, but they don't seem to pose an immediate threat to my king. However, I should be careful about potential checks.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the strongest move is to check the White king with the bishop, forcing a response and setting up the pawn promotion threat.\n\n```\nc4f1\n```"
