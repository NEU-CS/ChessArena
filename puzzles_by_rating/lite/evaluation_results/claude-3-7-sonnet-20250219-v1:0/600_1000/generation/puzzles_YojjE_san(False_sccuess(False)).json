When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, rook, bishop, and pawns. Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawns.\n- Material count: White has Q+R+B+5P vs Black's Q+R+B+N+5P, so Black is up a knight.\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe, while Black's king is in the center.\n- Piece activity: White's queen is on f7, putting pressure on Black's position.\n\nKey observations:\n1. White's queen on f7 is attacking the rook on e8.\n2. Black's queen on e4 is undefended.\n3. Black's king is on c7, somewhat exposed.\n4. White's bishop on c3 can potentially capture Black's knight on e5.\n\nLet me consider the most promising candidate moves:\n1. Qxe8 (f7e8): Capturing the rook would win material.\n2. Cxe5 (c3e5): Capturing the knight would recover material.\n3. Qxe7 (f7e7): Capturing the bishop would win material.\n\nAnalyzing each option:\n- f7e8 (Qxe8): After capturing the rook, Black would likely recapture with Bxe8, and White would still be down material.\n- c3e5 (Bxe5): This captures the knight, but Black can recapture with dxe5 or Qxe5.\n- f7e7 (Qxe7): This captures the bishop directly next to Black's king, putting Black in a very difficult position.\n\nLooking deeper at Qxe7:\nIf White plays Qxe7, Black's king is in serious trouble. The king has very limited escape squares, and White threatens immediate checkmate threats. This looks like a decisive advantage for White despite being down material.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the strongest move is:\n\n```\nf7e7\n```\n\nThis captures Black's bishop, creates immediate threats against the king, and should lead to a winning position for White despite the material deficit."
