When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Otherwise, material is even.\n- King safety: White's king is on g2, Black's on e7.\n- Piece activity: White has a knight on g5 that's very active and threatening.\n- Pawn structure: White has a passed pawn on f4.\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities:\n1. The knight on g5 is attacking e6, which is defended by the Black king.\n2. The most striking possibility is Nxh7, capturing the rook.\n\nLet me check if g5h7 (Nxh7) works:\n- After Nxh7, Black's rook is captured.\n- Black might respond with Qxh7, but then White can play Qg7+ forking the king and rook.\n- If Black moves the king to avoid the fork, White keeps the material advantage.\n\nThis looks like a clear material gain with no apparent drawbacks. The knight sacrifice leads to winning Black's rook for the knight, which is a favorable exchange.\n\nLet me double-check if there are any better moves or if I'm missing any defensive resources for Black:\n- No immediate checkmate opportunities\n- No other captures that win material as cleanly\n- The knight capture is tactically sound\n\n```\ng5h7\n```"
