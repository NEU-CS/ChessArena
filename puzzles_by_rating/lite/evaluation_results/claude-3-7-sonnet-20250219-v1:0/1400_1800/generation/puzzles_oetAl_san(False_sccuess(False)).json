When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material is roughly equal (White has 2 knights, bishop, 2 rooks vs Black's queen, rook, bishop)\n- Black's queen on d5 is quite active and potentially threatening\n- White's pieces are reasonably developed\n- Black's king on g8 has some pawn protection but could be vulnerable\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves (f3g5, f3e5, f3h4, etc.)**: \n   - f3g5 looks interesting as it attacks the e5 pawn and puts pressure on Black's kingside\n   - f3e5 directly captures a pawn but loses the knight to the queen\n\n2. **Bishop moves (e3h6, e3g5, etc.)**:\n   - e3g5 threatens the e5 pawn\n   - e3h6 directly attacks the g7 pawn near Black's king\n\n3. **Rook moves (f1e1, a1c1, etc.)**:\n   - These could improve piece positioning but don't seem immediately decisive\n\n4. **Pawn moves**:\n   - Most don't seem critical in this position\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities, I notice that the move e3h6 directly attacks the g7 pawn. If Black captures with gxh6, White can play Ng5 threatening the h7 pawn and creating mating threats. This looks very promising.\n\nLet's double-check this idea:\n- e3h6 attacks g7\n- If Black plays g7h6 (capturing the bishop), then f3g5 creates serious threats toward h7 and f7\n- Black's king would be very exposed\n- This looks like a strong sacrifice that could lead to a winning attack\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the best move is:\n\n```\ne3h6\n```\n\nThis bishop sacrifice initiates a powerful attack against Black's king and should give White excellent winning chances."
