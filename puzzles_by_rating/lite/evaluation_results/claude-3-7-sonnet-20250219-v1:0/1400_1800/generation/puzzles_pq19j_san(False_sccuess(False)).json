When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'm playing as Black in this position. Let me analyze the current board state carefully.\n\nFirst, let's assess the material balance:\n- Black has: 2 rooks, 1 bishop, 1 knight, and 5 pawns (total value ~19)\n- White has: 2 rooks, 1 bishop, and 7 pawns (total value ~17)\n\nSo I have a slight material advantage with the extra knight. However, White has active pieces with the rook on e5 and bishop on c4 threatening my position.\n\nKey threats and opportunities:\n1. White's rook on e5 is attacking my knight on d5\n2. White's bishop on c4 is pinning my knight to my king\n3. My knight on d5 is currently under attack and pinned\n4. My bishop on c5 is undefended\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves (d5)**: All knight moves would expose my king to check from the bishop on c4, so these are illegal despite being listed.\n\n2. **Rook moves**:\n   - Moving the c7 rook: These are safe but don't address immediate threats\n   - Moving the d6 rook: Could defend the knight or create counterplay\n\n3. **Bishop moves (c5)**: Could retreat to safety or create threats\n\n4. **Pawn moves**: Not immediately critical\n\nThe most pressing issue is my pinned knight on d5. I need to either break the pin, defend the knight, or create counterplay.\n\nLooking at specific moves:\n- `d6e6` would defend the knight on d5\n- `c5a7` or `c5b6` would move the bishop to safety\n- `d6c6` could create a rook battery with potential threats\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe `d6e6` is the best move. It defends the knight on d5 from the rook attack, maintains control of the e-file, and keeps my pieces coordinated. This move addresses the immediate threat while maintaining my material advantage.\n\n```\nd6e6\n```"
