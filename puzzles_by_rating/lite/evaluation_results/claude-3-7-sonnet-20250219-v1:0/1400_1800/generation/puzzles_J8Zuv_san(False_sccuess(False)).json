When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The knight on e5 is attacking multiple squares and could be a powerful piece\n2. The bishop on g5 is pinning Black's knight on f6 to the queen\n3. White has the option to castle kingside (e1g1)\n\nLet me evaluate some candidate moves:\n\n1. **e5f7**: Knight fork attacking Black's rook and queen - this looks very strong as it threatens to win material.\n\n2. **g5f6**: Capturing the knight would win a piece, but Black can recapture with the g-pawn, opening the g-file against White's king if it castles.\n\n3. **e1g1**: Castling to safety is always worth considering.\n\n4. **e5g6**: Knight fork threatening Black's king and pawn.\n\nAnalyzing the strongest candidates deeper:\n\n**e5f7** would fork Black's queen and rook. After Black moves the queen (likely to d8), White can capture the rook, winning a full exchange.\n\n**e5g6** creates a fork on the king and pawn, but after Black moves the king to g8, White only wins a pawn.\n\n**g5f6** captures a knight, but after gxf6, White doesn't gain much advantage.\n\n**e1g1** is safe but misses the tactical opportunity.\n\nThe knight fork on f7 is clearly the strongest move as it wins material with a forced sequence.\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
