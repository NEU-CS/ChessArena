When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, rook, knight, bishop, and pawns.\n- Material count: White has Q+R+B+7P = 9+5+3+7 = 24 points\n- Black has Q+R+N+B+7P = 9+5+3+3+7 = 27 points\n- Black is ahead by 3 points (a minor piece)\n- Black's rook on d3 is attacking White's position\n- Black's queen on g6 and bishop on f6 are controlling important diagonals\n- White's rook on e4 is under attack by Black's knight on e5\n\nSince I'm at a material disadvantage, I need to find a way to equalize or create counterplay.\n\nKey threats:\n1. Black's knight on e5 is attacking my rook on e4\n2. Black's rook on d3 is a major threat in my position\n3. My queen on c2 and Black's rook on d3 are on the same diagonal\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n1. Capturing the knight with e4e5 would lose my rook to the bishop on f6\n2. Moving the rook to safety (e4f4, e4g4, e4h4) abandons defense of the e3 bishop\n3. Capturing the rook with c2d3 looks promising as it eliminates a major threat\n\nLet me analyze c2d3:\n- I capture Black's rook with my queen\n- Black would likely recapture with the knight (e5d3)\n- I could then move my rook to safety\n\nThis seems like the best move as it eliminates Black's rook which is deep in my position, and after the exchange, I'd be down only a minor piece rather than a rook.\n\n```\nc2d3\n```"
