When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, bishop, queen, and 4 pawns. Material is equal.\n- Position: White's rook on d7 is active and threatening Black's king area. Black's king is on h7 with limited protection.\n- Threats: Black's queen on d4 is attacking White's bishop on a3. Black's rook on b5 is also active.\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **Attacking moves**:\n   - `d7g7`: Capturing Black's bishop with check seems very strong\n   - `a3f8`: Bishop check, but Black can block with the bishop\n\n2. **Defensive moves**:\n   - Moving the a3 bishop to safety\n\n3. **Other tactical possibilities**:\n   - Is there a checkmate threat?\n\nThe move `d7g7` stands out immediately as it captures a piece with check. Let's analyze what happens after:\n- White plays `d7g7` (capturing bishop with check)\n- Black must move king to h8 or g8\n- If king goes to h8, White has `a3f8` checkmate!\n- If king goes to g8, White has `g7h7+` followed by queen moves to deliver checkmate\n\nThis is a decisive combination. Taking the bishop with check leads to a forced mate sequence.\n\n```\nd7g7\n```"
