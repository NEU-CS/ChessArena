When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has two rooks, a queen, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed. White's king is on g1.\n- Pawn structure: Black has an advanced d-pawn on d4 which could be valuable.\n- Piece activity: Black's queen on g4 is active, and the rook on e5 is well-placed.\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **Queen moves**: The queen on g4 has several interesting options:\n   - g4e2: Attacking White's pawn and creating threats\n   - g4f3: Attacking the g3 pawn\n   - g4h3: Threatening to penetrate White's position\n\n2. **Rook moves**: The rook on e5 is well-positioned:\n   - e5e2: Direct attack on White's pawn\n   - e5e3: Threatening to penetrate\n\n3. **King safety**: Moving the king to h8 or f8 might improve safety.\n\n4. **Pawn advances**: Considering h5h4 to attack White's g3 pawn.\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities, I notice that g4e2 would attack White's pawn with the queen. If White moves the pawn, Black's rook on e5 could then attack along the e-file.\n\nAnother strong possibility is e5e3, penetrating White's position and threatening the e2 pawn.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the most powerful move is to play e5e3, penetrating White's position with the rook and creating immediate threats. This puts pressure on White's second rank and creates tactical possibilities involving both the rook and queen.\n\n```\ne5e3\n```"
