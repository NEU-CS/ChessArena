When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: White has a rook, knight, and pawn vs Black's rook and 3 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King positions: White's king is on c3, Black's on f8\n- Pawn structure: Black has pawns on a5, d3, e5, and f4, while White only has a pawn on b2\n- Piece activity: White's rook on a7 is active, knight on f3 controls important squares\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Black's d3 pawn is close to promotion\n2. Black's rook on d5 is active and defending the e5 pawn\n3. White's rook on a7 is very active and threatening the 7th rank\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. Rook moves along the 7th rank (a7e7, a7f7, etc.):\n   - These moves threaten to attack Black's king position\n   - Particularly a7f7+ would check the king\n\n2. Knight moves:\n   - f3e5 captures a pawn but loses the knight to d5 rook\n   - f3d4 blocks the f4 pawn's advance\n\n3. King moves:\n   - c3d2 could stop the d3 pawn from promoting\n\n4. a7a8:\n   - This move threatens to promote if Black's king moves away from f8\n\nAfter analysis, I believe a7f7+ is the strongest move. It checks the Black king, forcing it to move, after which White can capture the e5 pawn with the knight. This creates a decisive material advantage.\n\n```\na7f7\n```"
