When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position step by step to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material is roughly equal\n- White has a pawn on e5, creating space advantage\n- Black has a bishop on g5 that could be targeting White's queen\n- Black's queen is on b6, potentially creating pressure\n- White's pieces are generally well-developed\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **Bishop moves (f3h5, f3d5, f3g4, etc.)**:\n   - f3h5 would attack the g7 pawn but loses control of important central squares\n   - f3g4 develops the bishop more actively but might be exposed\n   - f3d5 directly captures a pawn but would likely be recaptured\n\n2. **Knight moves (d3c5, d3f4, etc.)**:\n   - d3c5 attacks Black's queen but allows the bishop to be captured\n   - d3f4 develops the knight to a good square, potentially threatening g6 later\n\n3. **Queen moves (d2a5, d2b4, etc.)**:\n   - d2b4 could pressure Black's queen and pawn\n   - d2c3 develops to a safer square\n\n4. **Rook moves (c2c6, c2c5, etc.)**:\n   - c2c6 directly attacks the knight\n   - c2c5 attacks the pawn and puts pressure on Black's position\n\nAfter careful consideration, c2c6 stands out as a strong tactical move. It directly attacks Black's knight on c6, and if the knight moves, White can potentially win material. The knight is pinned to the queen, so this creates a serious threat.\n\n```\nc2c6\n```"
