When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Looking at the c5 bishop, I notice it's on the a7-g1 diagonal, pointing toward White's kingside. This could be significant.\n\n2. The bishop can capture on f2, which would be a direct attack: c5f2. Let's analyze this:\n   - If White recaptures with the queen (e2f2), then Black has Qd1+ followed by Qxg1#\n   - If White recaptures with the rook (f1f2), then Black has Qd1+ followed by Qxf1#\n\nThis appears to be a winning combination! The bishop sacrifice on f2 creates a devastating attack.\n\n3. Let me double-check this:\n   - c5f2 (bishop takes pawn)\n   - If e2f2 (queen takes bishop), then d8d1+ forces h1h2, then d1g1#\n   - If f1f2 (rook takes bishop), then d8d1+ forces h1h2, then d1f1#\n\nThis is a clear winning combination with a forced mate.\n\n```\nc5f2\n```"
