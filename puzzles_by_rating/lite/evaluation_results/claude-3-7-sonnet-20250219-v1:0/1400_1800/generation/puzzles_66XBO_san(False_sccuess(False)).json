When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- White's bishop on b5 is attacking c6 knight\n- White's queen on f4 is active and potentially threatening\n- Black's king on g8 is relatively safe for now\n- The e5 pawn is advanced and could be a target\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves**: The knight on c6 is under attack by the bishop on b5. Moving it would be a priority.\n   - c6d4: Knight attacks White's queen on f4, but White can capture with e3xd4\n   - c6e5: Knight to e5 controls central squares and can't be immediately captured\n   - Other knight moves seem less impactful\n\n2. **Queen moves**: \n   - c8g4: Queen attacks White's queen, but White can retreat with minimal issues\n   - c8h3: Queen goes to h3, but doesn't seem to create immediate threats\n\n3. **Pawn moves**:\n   - d5d4: Challenging White's center, but after e3xd4, Black doesn't gain much\n\n4. **Defensive moves**:\n   - h7h6 or g7g6: Creating luft for the king, but not addressing immediate threats\n\nThe knight on c6 is under attack, so I should prioritize that. Among the knight moves, c6e5 stands out as it:\n1. Moves the knight to safety\n2. Occupies the strong central e5 square\n3. Can't be immediately captured as it's protected by the d5 pawn\n4. Puts pressure on White's position\n\nThis move addresses the immediate threat while improving piece activity and central control.\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
