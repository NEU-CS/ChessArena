When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: White has a queen, two rooks, and two knights vs Black's queen, two rooks, bishop, and knight. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe, while Black's king is exposed with the h7 knight giving check.\n- Piece activity: Black has a rook on c3 that's very active, and a knight on g4 threatening White's queen.\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have similar pawn structures.\n\nKey observations:\n1. White's knight on h7 is giving check to Black's king.\n2. Black's knight on g4 is threatening White's queen on f2.\n3. Black's rook on c3 is very active in White's position.\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. h7f8: Knight captures bishop with check, but after Kxf8, White loses the initiative.\n\n2. h7f6: Knight check forcing Black's king to move, but doesn't gain material.\n\n3. f2f7: Queen move threatening checkmate on h7, but Black can defend with Qd8.\n\n4. f2g3: Moves the queen away from the knight threat while attacking Black's knight on g4.\n\n5. h4g6: Knight captures pawn with check, forcing Black's king to move.\n\nLooking deeper at h4g6:\nAfter h4g6+, Black must respond with Kg8 or Kg7. Then White can play f2f7 threatening mate. This looks very strong.\n\nLooking at f2g3:\nThis attacks Black's knight on g4, but Black can simply retreat the knight and White hasn't gained much.\n\nThe move h4g6+ creates an immediate tactical threat. After Kg8/Kg7, White can follow with Qf7 threatening mate, and Black will have difficulty defending.\n\n```\nh4g6\n```"
