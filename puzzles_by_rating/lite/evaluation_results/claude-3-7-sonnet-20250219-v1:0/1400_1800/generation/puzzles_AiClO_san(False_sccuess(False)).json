When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This would win a pawn but the knight might be captured by White's pawn on f2.\n\n2. **g4f2**: Knight fork attacking White's king and rook. This is a powerful tactical move that would win material.\n\n3. **e4f3**: Capturing White's knight, but this would open up the e-file for White's rook.\n\n4. **f8e7**: Developing the bishop and preparing to castle.\n\n5. **d8f6**: Moving the queen to an active square, attacking White's knight on f5.\n\nLooking at the tactical possibilities, g4f2+ stands out as a very strong move. This knight fork attacks both White's king on g1 and rook on f1. White would be forced to move the king, after which Black can capture the rook, winning a major piece.\n\nAfter 1...Nf2, White must move the king to either h1 or e1, and then Black can capture the rook with 2...Nxf1, gaining a significant material advantage.\n\nThis is clearly the best move in the position as it wins material through a tactical combination.\n\n```\ng4f2\n```"
