When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me check if I can prevent this promotion or if I need to find counterplay.\n\nCan I capture the d7 pawn? No, it's too far from both my king and rook.\nCan I prevent promotion with a check? Let me see if my rook can deliver a check that forces the White king to deal with it.\n\nLooking at rook moves:\n- Moving the rook to a6+ would check the king, but White can simply capture Ra6 with the pawn\n- Moving to the first rank (a1-h1) doesn't create immediate threats\n\nWhat about advancing my f3 pawn? With f3-f2, I'm threatening to promote myself.\n\nLet's compare the timing:\n- White needs 1 move to promote the d7 pawn\n- I need 2 moves to promote my f3 pawn (f3-f2, then f2-f1)\n\nSince I can't stop White's promotion directly, my best chance is to create the strongest counterplay. The move f3-f2 advances my pawn to the second rank, creating an immediate promotion threat.\n\nAfter White promotes on d8, I'll have my own pawn on f2 ready to promote. This gives me the best fighting chances in what appears to be a losing position.\n\n```\nf3f2\n```"
