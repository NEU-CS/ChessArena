When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The black king is quite active at f5\n2. White's knight on e5 is centralized and has multiple options\n3. The pawn structure will be important for endgame prospects\n\nLet me evaluate the candidate moves:\n\nKnight moves:\n- e5f7: Attacks the h6 pawn but moves away from the center\n- e5d7: Moves to a less active square\n- e5g6: Attacks the h6 pawn and controls important squares\n- e5c6: Controls d8 but not particularly strong\n- e5g4: Attacks the black king but can be captured\n- e5c4: Trades knights, simplifying the position\n- e5f3: Moves to a less active square\n- e5d3: Moves to a less active square\n\nKing moves:\n- g1g2, g1f2, g1h1, g1f1: Normal king moves, not critical\n\nPawn moves:\n- h2h3, h2h4: Advancing the h-pawn\n\nThe knight on e5 is very strong, controlling key squares. Moving it to g4 would attack the black king, but the knight could be captured. Moving to g6 attacks the h6 pawn and controls important squares.\n\nI think the best move is e5g6+, which:\n1. Gives check to the black king\n2. Attacks the h6 pawn\n3. Controls important squares\n4. Forces the black king to move, likely to e5 or g5\n\n```\ne5g6\n```"
