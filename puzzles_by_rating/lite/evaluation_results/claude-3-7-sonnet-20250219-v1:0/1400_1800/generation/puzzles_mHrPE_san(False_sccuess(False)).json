When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I'm playing as White, and I have a limited set of legal moves: c4e2, g1f3, and g1e2.\n\nFirst, let me assess the current position:\n- Material: I have a queen on h8, rook on a1, knight on d5 and g1, bishop on c4, and pawns. Black has a queen on f2, rooks on a8, knights on c6 and g8, bishops on c5 and g4, and pawns.\n- Black's queen on f2 is threatening my king on d1.\n- My queen on h8 is threatening Black's king on e8.\n- This is a critical position where both sides have attacking chances.\n\nLet me analyze each legal move:\n\n1. c4e2 (Bishop to e2):\n   - This blocks the check from Black's queen\n   - It protects my king\n   - However, it blocks development of my knight to e2\n\n2. g1f3 (Knight to f3):\n   - This doesn't block the check, so it's illegal in this position\n   - Actually, this can't be a legal move since I'm in check\n\n3. g1e2 (Knight to e2):\n   - This blocks the check from Black's queen\n   - It develops a piece\n   - It keeps the bishop free for other purposes\n\nSince I'm in check, I must address it immediately. Between c4e2 and g1e2, I need to determine which is better.\n\nThe bishop on c4 is currently targeting Black's kingside and could be valuable in an attack. Moving it to e2 would diminish its activity. On the other hand, developing the knight to e2 brings a new piece into play while handling the check.\n\nGiven that I have a queen on h8 threatening Black's king, maintaining attacking pressure seems important. Therefore, I should keep my bishop active and use the knight to block the check.\n\n```\ng1e2\n```"
