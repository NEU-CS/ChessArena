When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This doesn't improve my position and wastes a tempo.\n\n2. **e8c6**: Queen to c6, attacking Black's bishop on b7. This threatens to capture the bishop but doesn't immediately improve my attacking chances against the king.\n\n3. **e8e4**: Queen to e4, attacking the d4 pawn and potentially threatening the knight on f4. This move doesn't directly increase pressure on the black king.\n\n4. **b6d5**: Knight to d5, creating a central outpost. Good position but not immediately decisive.\n\n5. **d2e4**: Knight to e4, attacking the d4 pawn. Not particularly forcing.\n\n6. **d2f3**: Knight to f3, blocking the black rook on f2 from attacking my king. This is defensive but doesn't capitalize on my attacking potential.\n\n7. **c1c6**: Rook to c6, attacking the a6 pawn. This doesn't leverage my attacking position.\n\nLooking at the position more carefully, I notice that Black's king is very exposed on g8, with only the bishop on f8 defending. My queen on e8 is already putting pressure, and I should look for a decisive attack.\n\nThe most promising move appears to be **e8c6**, attacking the bishop on b7. If Black defends the bishop, I can continue building pressure. If Black moves the bishop, I can potentially create more threats against the king.\n\nHowever, I need to check if there's a more direct winning approach. Looking at the position again, I see that if I play **e8e4**, I'm threatening the knight on f4, but this doesn't seem to lead to an immediate win.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the best move is:\n\n```\ne8c6\n```\n\nThis attacks the bishop on b7, creates threats, and maintains pressure while improving my queen's position."
