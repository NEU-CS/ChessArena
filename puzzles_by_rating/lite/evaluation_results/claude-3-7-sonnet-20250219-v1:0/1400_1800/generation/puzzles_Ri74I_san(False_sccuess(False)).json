When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King activity in endgames is crucial\n2. Pawn structure and potential passed pawns\n3. Potential for creating weaknesses in Black's position\n\nLet me analyze candidate moves:\n\n1. King moves (e3f3, e3d3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2):\n   - Moving the king toward Black's pawns could be advantageous\n   - e3d3 approaches Black's king and central pawns\n   - e3f3 protects the f4 pawn and could support f4-f5 later\n\n2. Pawn moves:\n   - f4e5: Captures Black's e5 pawn, but likely loses the f-pawn after Black recaptures\n   - f4f5: Creates a passed pawn, but might be vulnerable\n   - h3h4: Fixes Black's h5 pawn and gains space\n   - g3g4: Attacks h5 but could create weaknesses\n   - a2a3/a2a4: Queenside expansion, but slow\n\nThe most promising ideas seem to be:\n- Advancing the f-pawn to create a passed pawn with f4-f5\n- Moving the king to support this advance\n- Attacking Black's h5 pawn with g3-g4\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the best move is f4f5. This creates a passed pawn that will require Black's attention. If Black captures with g6f5, I can recapture with g3f4 and have good winning chances with my passed f-pawn. If Black ignores it, the f-pawn becomes dangerous.\n\n```\nf4f5\n```"
