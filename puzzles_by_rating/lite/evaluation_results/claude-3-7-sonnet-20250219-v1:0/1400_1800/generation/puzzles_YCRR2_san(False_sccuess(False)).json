When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's rook is active on g1, potentially threatening checks\n2. White's king is exposed on h4\n3. White's rook on b4 is active but not directly threatening anything crucial\n4. The pawn structure will be important for endgame considerations\n\nLet me analyze candidate moves:\n\n1. **b4b8**: Moving the rook to the 8th rank doesn't create immediate threats and leaves the e4 pawn undefended.\n\n2. **b4b7**: This move threatens the g7 pawn, which could be valuable. If Black defends with g7-g6, White can consider advancing the e-pawn.\n\n3. **b4b6+**: This gives a check, forcing the black king to move, but doesn't lead to a clear advantage after the king moves.\n\n4. **e4e5+**: This pawn advance gives check and gains space. The black king would have to move to e6 or g5, both of which allow White to make progress.\n\n5. **f3f4**: This secures more space but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe e4e5+ is the strongest move. It gives check, gains space, and forces the black king to an awkward square. If the king moves to e6, White can follow up with the rook to the 6th rank. If the king moves to g5, White can consider h3-h4+ later.\n\n```\ne4e5+\n```"
