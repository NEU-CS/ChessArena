When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is exposed on c4, while Black's king is on h7.\n- Piece activity: Black's rook on g4 and queen on f3 are actively placed and seem to be pressuring White's position.\n\nLooking at the position more deeply, I notice that White's king on c4 is in a vulnerable position. Black's queen on f3 and rook on g4 are already creating pressure. This suggests we should look for tactical opportunities against White's king.\n\nLet's examine potential tactical ideas:\n1. The queen on f3 controls the c3-f6 diagonal and can potentially coordinate with other pieces.\n2. The rook on g4 is attacking along the 4th rank where White's king sits.\n3. The bishop on d6 controls the a3-f8 diagonal.\n\nI see a potential checkmate pattern: if we can attack the c4 king with multiple pieces, we might force checkmate.\n\nLooking at the legal moves, I notice Qd3 (f3d3) would be a direct check to White's king. After this check, White's king has limited escape squares:\n- If Kc5, then Qd5# is checkmate\n- If Kb4, then Qd4+ followed by Qc5# is checkmate\n- If Kb5, then Qd5+ followed by Qc5# is checkmate\n\nThis is a forced checkmate sequence starting with Qd3+.\n\n```\nf3d3\n```"
