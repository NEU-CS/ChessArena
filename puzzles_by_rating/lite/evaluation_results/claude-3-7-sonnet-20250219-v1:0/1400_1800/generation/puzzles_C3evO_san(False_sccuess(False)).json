When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a rook, bishop, and pawns vs White's two rooks, two knights, bishop, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- White has a knight on c7 that's attacking Black's position\n- Black's king safety is compromised with White's pieces positioned for an attack\n- The pawn structure shows Black has a pawn on f5 that could be vulnerable\n\nLet me examine the most critical aspects:\n\n1. The White knight on c7 is a major threat - it's deep in Black's territory and needs to be addressed\n2. Black's dark-squared bishop on h8 is poorly placed and undeveloped\n3. The f5 pawn might need protection\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n\n1. **c6e4** - Moving the bishop to e4 attacks White's f3 knight and develops the piece to a strong central square. This would put pressure on White's position.\n\n2. **g7h5** - Moving the knight to h5 develops it and could prepare for counterplay on the kingside.\n\n3. **f8e8** - Moving the rook to e8 defends the e-pawn and connects the rooks.\n\n4. **c6d7** - Moving the bishop to d7 would protect against the knight on c7, but blocks in the rook.\n\n5. **d8d7** - Moving the rook to d7 would challenge the knight on c7 directly.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe **c6e4** is the strongest move. It develops the bishop to an active square, puts pressure on White's knight, and improves Black's piece coordination. This move addresses Black's need for counterplay while developing pieces to more active positions.\n\n```\nc6e4\n```"
