If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

First, let me understand the current state of the board.\n\nLooking at the FEN notation, I'm playing as Black, and I have only two legal moves: e8f8 or e8d8, which are both king moves.\n\nLet me assess the position:\n1. Material count: White has a queen, two bishops, a knight, a rook, and several pawns. Black has a queen, a bishop, a knight, two rooks, and several pawns. Material seems roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: My king is in the center (e8), and White has several pieces aimed in that direction. This is concerning.\n\n3. Threats: Let me check if I'm in check or facing immediate threats.\n   - White's bishop on f7 is directly attacking my king\n   - White's knight on e5 is threatening my queen on d6\n   - White's queen on g4 and bishop on g5 are creating pressure\n\nThis is a very difficult position. I'm in check from the bishop on f7, which explains why I only have two legal moves - I must move my king.\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nFor e8f8:\n- I move my king to the kingside\n- My king would still be under attack from White's pieces\n- The f8 square is directly attacked by White's bishop on g5\n\nFor e8d8:\n- I move my king to the queenside\n- This gets me away from White's bishop on g5\n- The d8 square isn't directly attacked by any White piece\n\nGiven these considerations, e8d8 appears to be the better move as it takes my king away from immediate threats. Moving to f8 would keep my king in the line of fire from White's bishop on g5.\n\n```\ne8d8\n```"
