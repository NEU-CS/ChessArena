When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a bishop, rook, and 4 pawns. So material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on f3, Black's on c5.\n- Threats: Black's rook on h1 is threatening something on the back rank. Black has a bishop on f2 and a dangerous pawn on g3 close to promotion.\n\nThe most concerning element is Black's g3 pawn which is very close to queening. I need to address this immediate threat.\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n1. I could capture the g3 pawn with my king: f3g4\n2. I could try to use my rook to create counterplay\n3. I could use my bishop to create threats\n\nThe g3 pawn is the most urgent threat, so I should capture it immediately with my king. This prevents Black from promoting and gives me a material advantage.\n\n```\nf3g4\n```"
