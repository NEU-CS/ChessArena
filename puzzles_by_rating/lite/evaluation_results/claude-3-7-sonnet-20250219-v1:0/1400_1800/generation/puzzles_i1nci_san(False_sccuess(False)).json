When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material is roughly equal\n- White has an advanced pawn on f5, putting pressure on Black's knight on f6\n- Black has central pawns on d5 and c5\n- White's queen is on f3, with potential attacking possibilities\n- White's bishop on c1 is undeveloped\n\nLet me consider some candidate moves:\n\n1. **Bishop development options**:\n   - c1g5 looks strong, pinning the f6 knight to the queen\n   - c1f4 develops with tempo, attacking the d5 pawn\n   - c1e3 develops but is less active\n\n2. **Queen moves**:\n   - f3h5 creates an attack on the kingside\n   - f3g4 threatens the f6 knight\n\n3. **Knight moves**:\n   - c3d5 captures a central pawn\n   - c3e4 establishes a strong central outpost\n\n4. **Rook moves**:\n   - a1a7 is aggressive but premature\n\nLet's analyze the most promising candidates:\n\n**c1g5** pins the knight on f6 to Black's queen. If Black plays h6, we can retreat to h4 maintaining pressure. This develops a piece with tempo and creates tactical threats.\n\n**c3d5** captures a central pawn, but after cxd5, Black has a strong center and our bishop remains undeveloped.\n\n**f3h5** initiates a kingside attack, but it's not clear if there's enough force for a breakthrough yet.\n\nAfter careful consideration, c1g5 stands out as the best move. It develops a piece with tempo, creates tactical pressure on the f6 knight, and begins to coordinate an attack. This move follows good chess principles by developing pieces toward the center and creating immediate threats.\n\n```\nc1g5\n```"
