When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawns vs White's queen, two rooks, two bishops, and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is in the corner with some pawn protection. White's king is on h2.\n- Piece activity: Black's queen on a7 and bishop on e4 are active. The d4 rook is also well-placed.\n- Threats: White's bishop on h4 is pinning Black's h-pawn to the king.\n\nLooking at tactical opportunities:\n1. The bishop on e4 is attacking the white rook on c2 and has other potential targets.\n2. The d4 rook controls the d-file and could create threats.\n3. Black's queen on a7 has mobility but no immediate threats.\n\nLet me check for immediate tactical opportunities:\n- The bishop on e4 can capture the rook on c2: e4c2\n- But this would allow White's queen to capture on e4, so we need to ensure this is favorable.\n- The bishop on e4 can also move to g6, threatening White's h-pawn.\n- The move e4g2 would fork White's king and rook.\n\nThe move e4g2+ looks particularly strong as it forks White's king and rook. After White's king moves, Black can capture the rook on a1. This would give Black a material advantage.\n\nLet's verify there are no better options:\n- No immediate checkmate threats\n- No other forks or pins that would win material more efficiently\n- The e4g2+ move gains material with a check\n\n```\ne4g2\n```"
