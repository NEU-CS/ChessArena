When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nCurrent position assessment:\n- Material: White has a queen, knight, and 4 pawns. Black has a queen, bishop, and 4 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king on g2 is somewhat exposed with Black's queen on c3 potentially threatening checks.\n- Pawn structure: White has a passed pawn on c6 which is quite advanced and could be a decisive factor.\n\nLet me analyze the key aspects of this position:\n\n1. The c6 pawn is very advanced and close to promotion - this is a major asset for White.\n2. Black's queen on c3 is active and potentially threatening.\n3. Black's bishop on e5 controls important diagonals.\n\nKey candidate moves:\n\n1. **c6c7**: Advancing the passed pawn is very strong, as it's one step away from promotion.\n2. **f2c5**: Moving the queen to protect the c6 pawn while threatening Black's bishop.\n3. **f2e3**: Queen move that defends against the Black queen's threats.\n4. **a5c4**: Knight move that attacks Black's queen.\n\nAnalyzing these options:\n- **c6c7** forces Black to deal with the promotion threat immediately. If Black ignores it, White promotes next move.\n- **f2c5** protects the pawn and attacks the bishop, but Black's queen might have counterplay.\n- **a5c4** attacks Black's queen, but after the queen moves, White's knight might be vulnerable.\n\nThe passed pawn on c6 is White's strongest asset, and advancing it creates an immediate threat that Black must address. This is clearly the most forcing and powerful move.\n\n```\nc6c7\n```"
