When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, rook, two bishops, knight, and 7 pawns. So material is roughly equal.\n- White's knight on c6 is active and potentially threatening\n- Black's queen on b6 and rook on c7 are well-positioned\n- White's bishop on b5 is attacking along the diagonal\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves (c6)**:\n   - c6d8 would attack Black's king, but can be easily defended\n   - c6e7 looks strong, forking the king and rook\n   - Other knight moves seem less impactful\n\n2. **Bishop moves (b5)**:\n   - No immediate threats with the bishop\n\n3. **Rook moves (c1)**:\n   - c1c5 would attack the d5 pawn, but Black can defend it\n\n4. **Queen moves (a1)**:\n   - No immediate strong queen moves\n\nThe move c6e7+ stands out as it creates a fork between Black's king and rook. After c6e7+, Black's king must move, and White can capture the rook on c7 next move, gaining material.\n\nLet's verify there's no better option:\n- No immediate checkmate threats\n- No other piece captures available\n- No other forks or pins that would win material\n\nThe knight fork with c6e7+ is clearly the strongest move, winning a rook for a knight, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n```\nc6e7\n```"
