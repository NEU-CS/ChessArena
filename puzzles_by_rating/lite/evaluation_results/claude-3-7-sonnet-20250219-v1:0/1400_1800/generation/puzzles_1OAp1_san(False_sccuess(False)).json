When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White's knight on f7 is forking Black's king and rook\n2. White's queen on h5 is threatening the h6 pawn and potentially checkmate\n3. Black's knight on e3 is a strong piece that could create counterplay\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n1. g8h7 - King escapes the fork but abandons the rook\n2. f8e8/d8 - Moving the rook loses it to the knight\n3. e3 knight moves - Could create counterplay\n4. e7 queen moves - Could defend or counter-attack\n\nThe knight on f7 is an immediate threat that must be addressed. The most promising approach seems to be using the e3 knight to create counterplay.\n\nLet's examine e3g2, which threatens White's king with a discovered check if the f3 rook moves. This could force White to deal with this threat rather than capturing on f8.\n\nAnother strong option is e3f5, attacking White's queen.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe e3f5 is best as it attacks White's queen while developing counterplay. If White's queen moves, Black can then address the knight on f7.\n\n```\ne3f5\n```"
