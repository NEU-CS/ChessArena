White's rook on f8 is threatening my king on g8\n2. I must capture this rook to prevent checkmate\n3. There are no other legal moves available to me\n\nSince I only have one legal move, I'll play it.

My king is in check from White's queen on f8\n2. I have only one legal move: a8f8 (rook captures queen)\n3. After capturing the queen, I'll have relieved the immediate check\n\nThis is a forced move since it's the only legal move available. After capturing White's queen with my rook, I'll have gained a significant material advantage (a queen for a rook).\n\nThe position after a8f8 would be much better for me as Black, as I'll be up material (a queen is worth more than a rook) and my king will no longer be in check.\n\n```\na8f8\n```"
