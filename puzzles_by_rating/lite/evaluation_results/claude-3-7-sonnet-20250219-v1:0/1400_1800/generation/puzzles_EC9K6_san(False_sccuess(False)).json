When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me analyze the current board state:\n\nWhite has:\n- King on g2\n- Rook on d6\n- Bishop on c5\n- Pawns on e7, g3, h2\n\nBlack has:\n- King on e8\n- Queen on c1\n- Pawns on b4, c4, f7, g6, h7\n\nFirst, I notice that White's e7 pawn is about to promote, which is an immediate threat. However, I have a queen on c1 which gives me attacking possibilities.\n\nLet me evaluate my options:\n1. e8e7 - Capturing the pawn prevents promotion but puts my king in a bad position\n2. Queen moves - I should check if I can deliver checkmate or gain material\n3. Pawn moves - Need to assess if any advance my position\n\nLooking at queen moves, I notice I can potentially check the White king. Let me check if I can deliver checkmate:\n- c1g1 would be check, but the king can escape to f3\n- c1h1 would be check, but the king can escape to f2\n\nHowever, I notice that c1g5 threatens the White king and rook simultaneously. If White moves the king, I can capture the rook. If White moves the rook, I can deliver a devastating check.\n\nLet me also check c1e3, which would be a check. After Kg1, I could take the bishop on c5. But this seems less forcing than c1g5.\n\nThe move c1g5 creates a double attack (fork) on the king and rook, forcing White to move the king and allowing me to capture the rook next move. This is a strong tactical shot that wins material.\n\n```\nc1g5\n```"
