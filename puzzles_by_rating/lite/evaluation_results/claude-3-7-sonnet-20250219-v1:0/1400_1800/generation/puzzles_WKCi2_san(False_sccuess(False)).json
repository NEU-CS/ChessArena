When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let me assess the current state of the board.\n\nCurrent position assessment:\n- Material: I'm down material (White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawns while I have a queen, two rooks, bishop, knight, and pawns)\n- White's queen on c7 is threatening my pawn on b7\n- White's rook on b5 is active and threatening my position\n- White's knight on e5 is centralized and strong\n- My queen on a3 is active but potentially vulnerable\n- My king is still in the center and hasn't castled\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **Defensive moves for the king**:\n   - `e8f8` would move my king away from the center, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n2. **Queen moves**:\n   - My queen on a3 has many options. Let me consider the most promising ones:\n   - `a3c1` could attack White's back rank\n   - `a3d6` could put pressure on White's position and potentially threaten the knight on e5\n   - `a3b2` could attack White's pawn structure\n\n3. **Knight moves**:\n   - `g8f6` could challenge White's knight on e5\n\n4. **Bishop moves**:\n   - `g7f6` could challenge White's knight on e5\n   - `g7e5` would capture White's knight, but would likely be recaptured by White's pawn on d5\n\nLooking at immediate threats, I notice White's queen on c7 is threatening my b7 pawn. Also, White's position is very aggressive with the rook on b5 and knight on e5.\n\nThe move `g7e5` looks promising as it captures White's knight. After `g7e5`, White would likely recapture with `d5e5`, but then I could play `a3d6` attacking White's queen and the e5 pawn.\n\nAlternatively, `a3d6` directly could be strong, threatening White's queen on c7 and putting pressure on the e5 knight.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe capturing the knight with `g7e5` is the best move. It removes White's strong centralized knight and creates counterplay opportunities.\n\n```\ng7e5\n```"
