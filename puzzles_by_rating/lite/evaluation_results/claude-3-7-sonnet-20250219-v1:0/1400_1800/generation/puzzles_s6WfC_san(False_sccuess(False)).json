When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, knight, and 3 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on g1, relatively safe. Black's king is on f4, exposed.\n- Piece activity: White's rook on e7 is active. Black's knight on d4 and rook on e3 are well-positioned.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Black's king is exposed on f4\n2. Black's knight on d4 is threatening White's e-pawn\n3. Black's rook on e3 is attacking along the 3rd rank\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **Checkmate opportunities**: With Black's king on f4, I should look for potential checkmates.\n   - Bd5-e6 would be check, but Black can escape with Kf4-f3.\n   - Re7-f7+ would be check, but Black can block with Nd4-f5.\n\n2. **Bd5-e6+**: This check forces the Black king to move, but doesn't seem decisive.\n\n3. **Re7-f7+**: This check is interesting as it attacks the f6 pawn.\n\n4. **Re7-e8**: Preparing to promote a pawn later or move to the 8th rank for back-rank threats.\n\n5. **g2-g3+**: This is a discovered check from the bishop! Black's king must move, and we can capture the rook on e3 next.\n\nThis last option looks very strong. The g2-g3+ move delivers a discovered check from the bishop on d5 to the king on f4. After Black's king moves, White can capture the rook on e3, gaining material.\n\n```\ng2g3\n```"
