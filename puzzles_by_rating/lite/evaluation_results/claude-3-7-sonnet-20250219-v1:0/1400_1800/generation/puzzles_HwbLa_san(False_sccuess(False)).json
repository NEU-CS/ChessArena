When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, rook, bishop, and 5 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- Black's rook on b1 is active and potentially threatening.\n- White's queen on d5 and rook on f5 are creating pressure.\n- Black's king on h6 seems somewhat exposed.\n- White's king on h2 could also be vulnerable.\n\nLet me consider the most promising moves:\n\n1. **b1h1**: This rook move checks the white king. After Kg2, the rook would need to retreat, but it applies immediate pressure.\n\n2. **g6f5**: Capturing White's rook with the queen. This would win material, but I need to check if it's safe.\n   - After g6f5, White would likely play Qxf5, and then we'd have an even exchange.\n\n3. **f6h4**: Bishop move that attacks White's h-pawn and potentially creates threats.\n\n4. **b1b3**: Attacking White's c-pawn, but doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n\nLet me analyze the most critical lines:\n\nFor g6f5 (queen takes rook):\n- After g6f5, White plays Qxf5\n- Then I could play f6h4, attacking the queen and the h-pawn\n- White would likely move the queen, and I could capture the h-pawn\n\nFor b1h1+ (rook check):\n- After b1h1+, White must play Kg2\n- Then I could play g6e4+, forking king and bishop\n- This looks like a strong tactical sequence\n\nFor f6h4 (bishop to h4):\n- This attacks the h-pawn but doesn't create immediate threats\n- White could defend with Bf2 or simply ignore it\n\nThe b1h1+ followed by g6e4+ sequence looks very promising as it would win material. Let me double-check this:\n- b1h1+, Kg2, g6e4+ forks the king and bishop on g3\n- White must move the king, and I capture the bishop\n\nThis is a clear tactical win for Black.\n\n```\nb1h1\n```"
