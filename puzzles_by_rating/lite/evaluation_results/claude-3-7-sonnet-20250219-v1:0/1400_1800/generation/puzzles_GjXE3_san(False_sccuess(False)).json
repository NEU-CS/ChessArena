When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, knight, and several pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on c3, Black's on h8.\n- Threats: Black's rook on a2 and knight on g2 are active pieces that could threaten White.\n- Pawn structure: White has advanced pawns on e5 and f5, which could be promotion candidates.\n\nLet me examine the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **e4g2**: Capturing the knight with the bishop. This would win a piece immediately.\n\n2. **h3g3**: Moving the rook to attack the knight on g2, but the knight could simply capture the rook.\n\n3. **h3h6**: Threatening the h-pawn, but not immediately decisive.\n\n4. **e5e6**: Advancing a passed pawn, but not immediately threatening.\n\n5. **f5f6**: Advancing another passed pawn, potentially creating threats.\n\nThe most obvious strong move is e4g2, capturing Black's knight for free. Let me check if there are any tactical issues with this capture:\n- After e4g2, Black's rook on a2 is still attacking our b-pawn, but that's not an immediate threat.\n- The capture doesn't expose our king or other pieces to immediate danger.\n- We gain a clear material advantage by winning a knight.\n\nI don't see any reason not to capture the knight. This is a clear material gain with no apparent drawbacks.\n\n```\ne4g2\n```"
