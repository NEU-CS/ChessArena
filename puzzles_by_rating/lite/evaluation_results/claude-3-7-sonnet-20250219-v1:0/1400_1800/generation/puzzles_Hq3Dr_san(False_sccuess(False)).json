When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let's assess the material and position:\n- Material: White has a rook, queen, and 5 pawns. Black has a queen, rook, and 4 pawns. So material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is relatively safe. Black's king is exposed on b6.\n- Piece activity: White's rook on e8 and queen on g7 are active and threatening.\n\nLet me look for immediate threats or tactical opportunities:\n1. Black's queen on d6 is undefended\n2. Black's king on b6 is exposed\n3. White's rook on e8 and queen on g7 can coordinate for an attack\n\nThe most promising idea seems to be a queen check or attack on Black's king. Let me examine:\n- Qg7-b7+ would be checkmate, but the queen can't move there directly\n- Qg7-c7+ would be a strong check, forcing the king to a6 or a5\n- Re8-e6 would attack the queen, but Black could just capture with Qxe6\n\nLooking at Qg7-c7+:\nAfter 1. Qc7+ Ka6 (or Ka5), White has a powerful follow-up with 2. Qa7#\n\nThis is a forced checkmate in 2 moves. The queen check on c7 forces the king to move, and then Qa7# delivers checkmate.\n\n```\ng7c7\n```"
