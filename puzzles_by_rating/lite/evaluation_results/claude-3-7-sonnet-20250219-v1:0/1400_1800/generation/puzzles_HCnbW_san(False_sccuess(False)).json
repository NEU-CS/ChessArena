When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- White's rook is on e5, actively placed in the center and potentially threatening Black's position.\n- Black's king is on g8 with some pawn protection.\n- White's queen and bishop are aligned on the g3-b8 diagonal.\n\nLet me examine the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **f3f7**: This is a queen check that attacks the g7 pawn. If Black's king moves to h8, White can follow with Qxg7#. If Black blocks with Qf7, White captures the queen.\n\n2. **e5e6**: Attacking the bishop on e6, but after Black moves the bishop, there's no immediate follow-up.\n\n3. **f3h5**: Queen move that threatens h7, but Black can defend with g6.\n\n4. **e5g5**: Rook move threatening g7 pawn, but can be defended.\n\nThe move f3f7 stands out as particularly strong. Let's verify the consequences:\n- After Qf7+, Black must respond. \n- If Kg8-h8, then Qxg7# is checkmate.\n- If Black blocks with Qf7, White captures with Qxf7+ and then Kxf7, winning a queen for free.\n\nThis is a decisive tactical blow that should win the game immediately.\n\n```\nf3f7\n```"
