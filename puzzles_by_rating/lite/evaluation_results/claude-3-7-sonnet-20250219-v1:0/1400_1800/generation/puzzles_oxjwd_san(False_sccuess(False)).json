When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a rook, knight, and 3 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n- Black's king is exposed on b8, while White's king is on g1.\n- Black's rook on c2 is active and threatening.\n- Black's knight on d4 is centralized and strong.\n- White's bishop on f7 is very active and potentially threatening.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Black's rook on c2 is threatening White's second rank.\n2. White's bishop on f7 is attacking Black's kingside and could deliver checks.\n3. The exposed position of Black's king might offer tactical opportunities.\n\nLet me examine tactical possibilities:\n- Moving the bishop to g8 or e8 would check the Black king.\n- The bishop check on g8 would force the king to move, potentially setting up further tactics.\n\nLooking at the bishop check on g8:\n- If Bf7-g8+, Black king must move to a8 or c8.\n- After Ka8, White could follow with Bg8-h7 threatening the g7 pawn.\n- This creates pressure on Black's kingside while maintaining the bishop's activity.\n\nChecking defensive needs:\n- Black's rook on c2 is threatening, but not immediately dangerous as it can't capture anything vital yet.\n- Moving the rook on a1 to defend the second rank might be prudent, but the tactical opportunity with the bishop seems more pressing.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the bishop check appears to be the strongest move, creating immediate pressure and potentially leading to material gain or a kingside attack.\n\n```\nf7g8\n```"
