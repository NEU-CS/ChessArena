White's g7 pawn is about to promote\n2. White's rook on c1 is threatening Black's king\n3. Black needs to address these immediate threats\n\nLet me evaluate the legal moves:\n\nBishop moves (c8d7, c8b7, c8e6, c8f5, c8g4, c8h3):\n- None of these can stop the g7 pawn from promoting\n- None can capture the rook threatening the king\n\nKing moves (b2b3, b2a3, b2a2):\n- These don't address the pawn promotion threat\n- They move away from the rook but don't solve the core problems\n\nKing move b2c1:\n- This captures White's rook, eliminating one immediate threat\n- After this capture, White will still promote the g7 pawn to a queen\n\nPawn moves (a6a5, b5b4):\n- These don't address any immediate threats\n\nThe critical evaluation:\nIf I capture the rook with b2c1, White promotes to a queen with g7g8q. However, after capturing the rook, I might be able to force a draw by perpetual check or stalemate scenarios since my king would be active.\n\nThe alternative is trying to stop the pawn promotion with my bishop, but none of my bishop moves can reach g7 in time.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to capture the rook:\n\n```\nb2c1\n```"

White's g7 pawn is a major threat as it's one move away from promotion\n2. Black needs to either stop the pawn or create counterplay\n3. Black's own pawns could be promotion candidates\n\nLet me evaluate the legal moves:\n\nBishop moves (c8d7, c8b7, c8e6, c8f5, c8g4, c8h3):\n- None of these can directly stop the g7 pawn\n- c8f5 could potentially control the g6 square, but White's king protects g7\n\nKing moves (c1d2, c1c2, c1b2, c1d1, c1b1):\n- These don't address the immediate threat of White's pawn promotion\n- The king is too far away to help with the g7 pawn\n\nPawn moves (a6a5, b5b4):\n- These advance Black's own pawns toward promotion\n- b5b4 advances the more advanced pawn, potentially creating a passed pawn\n\nCritical analysis:\nWhite will play g7-g8=Q next move unless Black can prevent it or create an immediate threat. None of Black's moves can directly prevent the promotion. Therefore, Black must create the fastest counterplay possible.\n\nThe b5 pawn is already more advanced than the a6 pawn, so pushing it forward creates the strongest counterplay. After b5b4, Black threatens to advance this pawn further toward promotion.\n\n```\nb5b4\n```"
