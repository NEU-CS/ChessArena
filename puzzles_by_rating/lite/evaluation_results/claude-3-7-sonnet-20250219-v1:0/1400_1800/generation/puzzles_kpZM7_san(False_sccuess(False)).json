When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's pawn on f4 is more advanced than White's pawn on h3\n2. Black's king is centralized and supporting its pawn\n3. White's king is somewhat distant from Black's pawn\n\nKey considerations:\n- Can White stop Black's f-pawn from promoting?\n- Can White's h-pawn promote?\n- Is there a race between the pawns?\n\nLet me analyze each legal move:\n\n1. c3c4: Moves the king closer to Black's pawn, but still can't directly stop it. This is a logical approach.\n\n2. c3b4: Moves away from Black's pawn, which seems counterproductive.\n\n3. c3b3: Moves away from Black's pawn, not helpful.\n\n4. c3d2: Moves backward and away from Black's pawn, not good.\n\n5. c3c2: Moves backward, not helping stop Black's pawn.\n\n6. c3b2: Moves backward and away, not good.\n\n7. h3h4: Advances White's pawn, but the race is critical to calculate.\n\nLet me calculate the pawn race:\n- Black needs 4 moves to promote (f4-f3-f2-f1-f1Q)\n- White needs 5 moves to promote (h3-h4-h5-h6-h7-h8Q)\n\nSo if it were just a pawn race, Black would win. However, kings play a crucial role.\n\nThe key is to use the king to stop Black's pawn while potentially pushing our own. Moving the king to c4 gets closer to intercepting Black's pawn.\n\n```\nc3c4\n```"
