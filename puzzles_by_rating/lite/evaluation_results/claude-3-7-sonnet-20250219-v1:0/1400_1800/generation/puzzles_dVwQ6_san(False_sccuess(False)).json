When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a rook, queen, and 5 pawns.\n- Material is roughly equal, with Black having a bishop vs White having an extra pawn.\n- Black's king is exposed on b8 with limited protection.\n- White's queen on g5 is active and potentially threatening.\n- Black's rook on h8 is undeveloped.\n\nLet me examine key tactical considerations:\n1. Immediate threats: White's queen on g5 could be threatening Black's queen on f7.\n2. Defensive needs: Black's king safety is a concern.\n3. Counterattack possibilities: Black's queen on f7 has good mobility.\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- Queen moves: The f7 queen has many options. I should check for attacking opportunities.\n- Rook moves: The h8 rook could be developed.\n- King safety: Moving to a8 might improve king safety.\n\nAnalyzing specific promising moves:\n1. `f7f2`: This attacks White's pawn and puts pressure on White's king area. However, White might have defensive resources.\n2. `b8a8`: This improves king safety by moving away from the open b-file.\n3. `f7h5`: This attacks White's queen, forcing it to move.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe `f7h5` is the strongest move. It directly attacks White's queen, forcing it to retreat. This gives Black the initiative and relieves pressure. If White's queen retreats, Black can continue developing pieces with tempo.\n\n```\nf7h5\n```"
