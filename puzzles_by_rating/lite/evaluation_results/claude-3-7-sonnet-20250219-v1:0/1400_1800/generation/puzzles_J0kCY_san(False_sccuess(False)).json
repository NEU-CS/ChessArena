If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I'm playing as White, and I need to determine the best move from the given legal moves.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material is equal (both sides have 3 pawns)\n- My king is on g5, opponent's king is on c7\n- Pawn structure: I have pawns on f2, g2, h4; opponent has pawns on e4, f5, g6, h5\n- This is an endgame position where king activity and pawn structure are crucial\n\nLet me analyze each legal move:\n\n1. **g5h6**: Moving my king to h6 would put it behind the opponent's g6 pawn, potentially allowing me to capture it later. However, this might allow the black king to advance.\n\n2. **g5g6**: Capturing the g6 pawn immediately. This would eliminate one of Black's pawns but might expose my king to the f5 pawn.\n\n3. **g5f6**: Moving my king to f6 would control the e5 square and potentially threaten the f5 pawn.\n\n4. **g5f4**: Moving my king to f4 would attack the e4 pawn directly.\n\n5. **g2g3**: A pawn move that doesn't immediately affect the position but prepares g4 potentially.\n\n6. **f2f3**: Attacking the e4 pawn with a pawn.\n\n7. **g2g4**: A pawn move attacking the h5 pawn, but might weaken my king's position.\n\n8. **f2f4**: Directly attacking the e4 pawn with a pawn.\n\nThe critical factor here is the race between kings and pawns. I need to either stop Black's pawns or promote my own faster.\n\nThe move g5f4 looks strongest as it directly attacks the e4 pawn. If I can capture that pawn, I can significantly reduce Black's chances. Additionally, my king becomes more active in the center.\n\nAfter g5f4, if Black defends e4 with the king, I can continue advancing my pawns. If Black pushes the e-pawn, I can capture it.\n\n```\ng5f4\n```"
