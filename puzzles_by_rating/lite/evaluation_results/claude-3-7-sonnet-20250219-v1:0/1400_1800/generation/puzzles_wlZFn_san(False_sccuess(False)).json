When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The knight on d5 is a strong piece and should be preserved if possible\n2. The bishop pair could be a long-term advantage\n3. I should look for ways to increase piece activity\n4. I should check for any tactical opportunities\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n\n1. **Knight moves from d5**:\n   - d5c7: Knight fork targeting White's rook on c1 and potentially the a6 pawn\n   - d5e3: Attacking White's queen\n   - d5c3: Attacking White's queen\n   - Other knight moves seem less impactful\n\n2. **Bishop moves**:\n   - c6b5: Attacking the knight on c4\n   - e7f6/e7g5: Improving bishop activity\n\n3. **Pawn advances** like e6e5 could gain space\n\nThe move d5c7 stands out as it creates a fork between White's rook on c1 and potentially the a6 pawn. Let me verify this tactic:\n- If Nd5-c7, it attacks the rook on c1\n- White would need to move the rook\n- Then the knight could capture the a6 pawn\n\nHowever, I need to check if this is truly sound. After Nd5-c7, White's rook moves, and I take the a6 pawn, White might have compensation through piece activity.\n\nThe move d5e3 attacking White's queen is also interesting, but White can simply retreat the queen and there's no immediate follow-up.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the knight fork with d5c7 appears to be the strongest move, gaining material advantage by forcing White's rook to move and then capturing the a6 pawn.\n\n```\nd5c7\n```"
