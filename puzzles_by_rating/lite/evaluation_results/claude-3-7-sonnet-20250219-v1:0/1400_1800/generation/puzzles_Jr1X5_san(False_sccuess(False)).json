When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has a queen, knight, rook, and pawns.\n- Black's king is on c6, quite exposed.\n- White's queen is on f7, and knight on e7, both threatening Black's position.\n- Black's queen is on e5.\n- White's king is on d2.\n\nLet me evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. **c6d7**: Moving the king to d7\n   - This puts the king next to White's knight on e7, which is dangerous.\n   - White could capture with the queen (Qf7d7+) leading to a check.\n   - Very unsafe move.\n\n2. **c6c7**: Moving the king to c7\n   - This also puts the king adjacent to White's knight.\n   - White could play Qf7c7# which would be checkmate.\n   - Extremely bad move.\n\n3. **c6b7**: Moving the king to b7\n   - This moves away from the knight but still allows Qf7b7# checkmate.\n   - Fatal move.\n\n4. **c6d6**: Moving the king to d6\n   - This square is controlled by White's knight on e7.\n   - The king would be in check and this is an illegal move.\n   - (This shouldn't be in the legal moves list)\n\n5. **c6b6**: Moving the king to b6\n   - This avoids immediate threats.\n   - The king is safer here than on c6.\n   - White's queen can't deliver immediate checkmate.\n\n6. **c6b5**: Moving the king to b5\n   - This moves the king away from the knight threat.\n   - However, it exposes the king more in the center of the board.\n   - Less safe than b6.\n\n7. **e5e7**: Queen captures knight on e7\n   - This removes the knight threat.\n   - After Qxe7, White's queen on f7 would likely capture Black's queen.\n   - But this exchange would eliminate a dangerous attacking piece.\n   - After Qxe7 Qxe7, Black's king would be safer.\n\nComparing the best candidates:\n- **e5e7** (capturing the knight) removes an immediate threat and forces an exchange of queens, which helps Black's exposed king.\n- **c6b6** moves the king to a safer square but doesn't address White's attacking pieces.\n\nGiven Black's precarious king position and the threatening knight, capturing the knight with **e5e7** is the best move. This eliminates an immediate threat and forces White to exchange queens or lose material, reducing the attack against Black's king.\n\n```\ne5e7\n```"
