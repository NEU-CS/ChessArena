Since I can't save the rook directly with my king move, I need to choose the king move that gives me the best chances after I lose the rook.\n\nAfter careful consideration, f3e2 seems best as it:\n- Keeps my king more centralized\n- Moves toward my a-pawn which might be important for endgame\n- Maintains better coordination with my remaining rook on h1\n\n```\nf3e2\n```"

I'm up significant material (two rooks vs a bishop)\n2. Black has some passed pawns that could be dangerous\n3. I'm in check and must respond\n4. Black's rook on f2 is threatening my king\n\nLet me evaluate each legal move:\n\n**Option 1: e2e1**\nIf I move my king to e1, the rook on f2 still attacks my king. My rook on h1 could capture it next move with h1f1, but this allows Black's bishop on d4 to capture my rook on d3 (d4d3).\n\n**Option 2: e2d1**\nIf I move my king to d1, I escape check and protect my rook on d3 from the bishop. This seems clearly better as it preserves my material advantage.\n\nAfter e2d1, I can then use my rooks to attack Black's pieces and push my passed h-pawn. With proper play, my material advantage should be decisive.\n\nThe choice is clear:\n\n```\ne2d1\n```"
