When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I need to analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: I have a queen, bishop, rook, and king with pawns. Black has a queen, rook, and king with pawns.\n- Material count: I have Q+B+R (14 points) vs Black's Q+R (14 points), so roughly equal.\n- My queen on b7 is actively placed, attacking Black's a6 pawn.\n- Black's rook on c2 is threatening my bishop on e2.\n- Black's king on g8 is somewhat exposed.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. My bishop on e2 is under attack by Black's rook on c2. I need to address this threat.\n2. I could potentially create threats against Black's king.\n3. I should look for tactical opportunities.\n\nLet me examine some candidate moves:\n\n1. Saving the bishop:\n   - Moving the bishop (e2 to various squares) would lose material as Black would capture my rook on h1.\n   - I could defend the bishop with Qb7-f3, but that abandons the attack on the a6 pawn.\n\n2. Attacking moves:\n   - Qb7-f7+ looks promising as it checks the king and attacks the g7 pawn.\n   - After Qf7+, if Kh8, I can capture the g7 pawn with check.\n\n3. Capturing the rook:\n   - I don't see a way to capture the c2 rook directly.\n\nLet me analyze Qb7-f7+ more deeply:\n- After Qf7+, Kh8, Qxg7+, Kh8, and I don't see an immediate checkmate.\n- But this line gives me a pawn advantage and maintains pressure.\n\nThe move Qb7-f7+ seems strongest as it creates immediate threats against Black's king while forcing a response. This gives me the initiative and likely material gain.\n\n```\nb7f7\n```"
