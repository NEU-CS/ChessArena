When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is slightly ahead in material.\n- King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed with White's queen on h4 and rook on f3 pointing toward the kingside.\n- Threats: White has a dangerous attack with Qh4, Rf3, and Bg7 all targeting Black's king area.\n- The pawn on f6 is also threatening space near Black's king.\n\nLet me check immediate threats:\n- White's queen on h4 and rook on f3 are creating mating threats\n- The bishop on g7 is controlling important squares\n\nCritical defensive moves to consider:\n1. **h7h6** - This would attack White's bishop on g7, forcing it to move and relieving some pressure.\n2. **e5f4** - This bishop move attacks White's rook on f3, which is a key attacking piece.\n3. **d8f6** - This would capture White's advanced pawn, removing a key attacking element.\n\nLet me analyze these candidate moves:\n\n**h7h6**:\nThis attacks White's bishop on g7, but after Bxh6, Black's king position becomes even more vulnerable. Not recommended.\n\n**e5f4**:\nThis attacks White's rook on f3. If White moves the rook, Black relieves some pressure. If White ignores it, Black can capture a rook for a bishop, which is a material gain. This looks promising.\n\n**d8f6**:\nCapturing the pawn on f6 would remove an attacking element, but it places the queen in the line of fire from White's bishop on g7. After Bxf6, Black would lose the queen for a pawn. This is a terrible move.\n\n**e5d4**:\nThis move attacks White's queen, but after Qg3, the queen is safe and White's attack continues.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the move **e5f4** stands out as the best option. It attacks White's rook, which is a key attacking piece. If White moves the rook, pressure is relieved. If White ignores it, Black gains material by capturing the rook.\n\n```\ne5f4\n```"
