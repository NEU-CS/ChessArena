When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover.\n- Threats: White's knight on f6 is attacking h7 and g8, creating immediate threats.\n- White's queen on f4 is also creating pressure.\n\nThe most urgent issue is the knight on f6, which is threatening Black's position. Let me examine the options:\n\n1. Capturing the knight with g7xf6 would remove the immediate threat, but after Qxf6+ Black would be in serious trouble.\n\n2. Moving the king with Kg8 would walk into Nxe7, losing the queen.\n\n3. Moving the queen to safety while addressing threats:\n   - Qf8 would block the knight's attack and protect the king.\n   - Qe8 would also block potential checks.\n\n4. Developing counterplay:\n   - The d4 pawn is advanced and could be pushed to d3.\n   - The bishop on b7 controls the long diagonal.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the best move is to play Qf8, protecting against the knight's threats and securing the king's position.\n\nWait, I need to double-check if Qf8 is in the list of legal moves... I see e7f8 which is indeed Qf8.\n\nThis move:\n- Protects against the knight's threats\n- Secures the king\n- Maintains material balance\n- Prepares for counterplay\n\n```\ne7f8\n```"
