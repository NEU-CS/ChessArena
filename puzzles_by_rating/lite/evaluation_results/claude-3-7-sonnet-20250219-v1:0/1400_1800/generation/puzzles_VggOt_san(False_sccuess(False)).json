When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This suggests I should look for a checkmate opportunity.\n\nLet me examine some candidate moves:\n1. f7g8# - Queen to g8 would be checkmate as the king has no legal moves\n2. f7f8# - Queen to f8 would also be checkmate as it controls all escape squares\n3. d6f8 - Bishop to f8 would be check but not mate\n\nThe first two moves both deliver checkmate, but I should verify there are no defensive resources for Black.\n\nWith Qg8#, the Black king has no legal moves:\n- h8-h7 is blocked by White's queen on g8 controlling h7\n- h8-g7 is blocked by White's queen on g8 controlling g7\n- No other pieces can block or capture\n\nWith Qf8#, the Black king also has no legal moves:\n- h8-g7 is controlled by the White queen on f8\n- h8-h7 is controlled by the White queen on f8\n- No other pieces can block or capture\n\nBoth Qg8# and Qf8# deliver immediate checkmate. Since both are equally effective, I'll choose Qg8#.\n\n```\nf7g8\n```"
