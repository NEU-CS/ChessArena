When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If White moves the rook, Black gains tempo. If White captures with the bishop, Black recaptures and eliminates White's active bishop.\n\n2. **c3d2** - This bishop move also attacks the rook but is less forcing as White can simply move the rook.\n\n3. **c4e3** - This knight move creates a fork between White's king on f3 and rook on d3, which would be devastating.\n\n4. **d5e3** - This knight move also attacks the king but doesn't create a fork.\n\n5. **c3e1** - This bishop move doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n\nLooking at **c4e3**, this creates a knight fork attacking both White's king and rook simultaneously. This is a powerful tactical shot that would win material. White would have to move the king, allowing Black to capture the rook on the next move.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the knight fork with c4e3 is clearly the strongest move, winning material and improving Black's already advantageous position.\n\n```\nc4e3\n```"
