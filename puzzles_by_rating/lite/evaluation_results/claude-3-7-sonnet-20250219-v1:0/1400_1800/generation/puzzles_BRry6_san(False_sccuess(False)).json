When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King moves (b2c3, b2c2, b2a2, b2c1, b2b1, b2a1):\n   - The king is currently protecting the b4 pawn, which is important\n   - Moving away from b2 might allow Black's king to capture the b4 pawn\n\n2. Pawn move f5f6:\n   - This advances our passed f-pawn\n   - Creates a potential passed pawn that could promote\n\nKey considerations:\n- The position is a pawn endgame where both sides are trying to create passed pawns\n- White's f-pawn is already advanced and could become a decisive factor\n- Black's king is active and threatening our b4 pawn\n\nThe critical strategic decision is whether to keep the king defending the b4 pawn or to advance the f-pawn.\n\nIf we advance f5f6, Black's king can't stop both our king from advancing and our f-pawn from promoting. This creates a winning advantage as we can sacrifice the b4 pawn if needed while our f-pawn races to promotion.\n\nAfter careful analysis, advancing the f-pawn creates the strongest winning chances by forcing Black to deal with a dangerous passed pawn while we can use our king actively.\n\n```\nf5f6\n```"
