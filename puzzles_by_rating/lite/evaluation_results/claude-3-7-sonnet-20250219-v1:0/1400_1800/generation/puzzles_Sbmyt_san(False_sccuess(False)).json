When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material is roughly equal\n- White has a knight on d5 which is quite advanced\n- Black has a knight on c5 which is well-placed\n- Black still has castling rights and should consider using them\n- White's pawn structure is slightly better\n\nLet me evaluate some key candidate moves:\n\n1. **e8g8 (castling kingside)**: This is an important consideration as king safety is crucial. Castling would immediately improve Black's king safety and connect the rooks.\n\n2. **g7f6**: Developing the bishop and putting pressure on the d5 knight.\n\n3. **c5e4**: Attacking White's pawn on e4, but this would likely lead to an exchange where White recaptures with the f3 knight.\n\n4. **c8e6**: Developing the bishop and indirectly challenging the d5 knight.\n\n5. **c8f5**: Another bishop development option that puts pressure on the e4 pawn.\n\nAnalyzing deeper:\n- Castling (e8g8) is very important for king safety, especially since White's pieces are becoming active.\n- The knight on d5 is a concern - it's centralized and could be used for an attack.\n- The bishop on g7 is well-placed on the long diagonal.\n\nThe most urgent priority is king safety. While developing pieces is important, getting the king to safety should come first. After castling, Black can focus on challenging White's central control and developing the remaining pieces.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to castle kingside:\n\n```\ne8g8\n```\n\nThis move addresses the most critical need (king safety), connects the rooks, and prepares for counterplay on the queenside or in the center."
