When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a queen, 3 pawns.\n- King safety: White's king is on g2, Black's king is on h7.\n- Piece activity: White's queen is on f4, Black's queen is on d5.\n- Pawn structure: Both sides have isolated pawns.\n\nMaterial is equal (both sides have a queen and pawns), so I need to look for tactical opportunities or positional advantages.\n\nLet's examine the legal moves:\n1. King moves (g2h3, g2h2, g2g1, g2f1): These seem passive and don't improve White's position.\n2. Queen moves (f4e4, f4f3): Need to check if these create threats or improve the queen's position.\n3. Pawn move (f2f3): This could provide king safety but might weaken the pawn structure.\n\nLet me check for tactical opportunities:\n- Can I attack the black queen? Not directly.\n- Can I create a mating threat? Let me check.\n- Is there a queen trade possibility? If Qf4-e4, Black's queen can't capture due to discovered check.\n\nLooking at Qf4-e4:\nIf I play Qf4-e4, Black's queen can't capture my queen because my queen is defended by the g-pawn, and capturing would expose Black's king to check. This forces Black to move the queen, giving me a tempo.\n\nAfter Qe4, Black's queen must retreat, and I can potentially create threats against Black's king or win material.\n\nThis looks like the strongest move as it forces Black to react defensively while improving my queen's position.\n\n```\nf4e4\n```"
