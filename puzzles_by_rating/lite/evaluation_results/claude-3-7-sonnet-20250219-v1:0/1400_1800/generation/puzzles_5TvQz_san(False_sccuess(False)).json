When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Rook moves (h4h6, h4h5, h4g4, h4f4, h4e4, h4d4, h4c4, h4b4, h4a4, h4h3, h4h2, h4h1):\n   - h4h6: Captures White's h-pawn, equalizing material\n   - h4e4: Attacks White's rook, but White can simply move the rook\n   - h4d4: Protects the d3 pawn\n   - h4b4: Checks White's king, forcing it to move\n\n2. King moves (d1d2, d1c1):\n   - d1d2: Approaches the d3 pawn but blocks its advance\n   - d1c1: Sidesteps but doesn't improve position much\n\n3. Pawn move (d3d2):\n   - Advances the passed pawn, threatening promotion\n\nThe most critical decision is between capturing the h6 pawn (h4h6), checking the king (h4b4), or advancing the passed pawn (d3d2).\n\nIf I capture h4h6, White's rook can capture my pawn with Re6-d6, threatening my king.\n\nIf I play h4b4+, White must move the king, but after Ka3 or Kc3, I don't see a clear follow-up that improves my position significantly.\n\nThe pawn move d3d2 creates an immediate threat of promotion. White would need to address this immediately, likely with Re6-d6 to prevent d2-d1Q. This would give me tactical opportunities with my rook.\n\nAfter careful consideration, advancing the passed pawn seems most promising as it creates the most immediate threat.\n\n```\nd3d2\n```"
