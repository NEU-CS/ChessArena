When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for Black.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: Black has a rook, bishop, and 3 pawns. White has 2 rooks and 3 pawns. So material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on g3, somewhat exposed. White's king is on b3.\n- Threats: White's rooks on e7 and e2 are active. The e7 rook is threatening Black's 7th rank.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Black's c3 pawn is close to promotion\n2. Black's king on g3 is near White's h3 pawn\n3. White's rooks are both active on the e-file\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. **c3c2**: Not in the legal moves list, so the pawn can't advance further yet.\n\n2. **f4f3+**: This check forces the White king to move, potentially giving Black time to advance the c-pawn. However, after Kc4, White's rooks remain active.\n\n3. **g3h4**: Capturing White's h3 pawn removes a potential threat and wins material.\n\n4. **d8d1**: Threatening mate on b1, but White can block with Re1.\n\n5. **f4e4**: Attacking White's rook on e2, but White can simply move the rook.\n\nThe move **g3h4** stands out as it wins material immediately by capturing White's h-pawn. This improves Black's material advantage and removes a potential threat. After this capture, Black can focus on advancing the c-pawn toward promotion.\n\n```\ng3h4\n```"
