When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position step by step to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material is roughly equal\n- White has a pawn on d5 that's advanced\n- Black has a bishop on g4 pinning White's knight on f3 to the queen\n- Black's bishop on g4 is currently undefended\n- Black has a somewhat cramped position with knights undeveloped\n\nKey considerations:\n1. The undefended bishop on g4 is a tactical opportunity\n2. White's bishop on h4 is attacking Black's e7 bishop\n3. White has a space advantage with the d5 pawn\n\nLet me evaluate the most promising candidate moves:\n\n1. **h4e7**: Capturing Black's bishop with the bishop. This would win a piece for free since Black's bishop on e7 appears undefended. However, Black would likely recapture with the queen (Qxe7).\n\n2. **h4f6**: Bishop takes knight on f6. This would win a piece, but Black can recapture with the g-pawn, opening the g-file against White's king.\n\n3. **h4g5**: Moving the bishop to g5 would attack Black's queen, but the queen can simply retreat.\n\n4. **d5c6**: Capturing with the pawn would open lines and potentially create pressure.\n\nThe move **h4e7** stands out as particularly strong. Let's analyze it further:\n\nAfter h4e7, Black would likely play Qxe7. Then White could play f3xg4, capturing Black's bishop and winning a piece. Black would be down material with no immediate compensation.\n\nThis is a clear tactical win for White - capturing an undefended piece first with h4e7, then following up by capturing the g4 bishop.\n\n```\nh4e7\n```"
