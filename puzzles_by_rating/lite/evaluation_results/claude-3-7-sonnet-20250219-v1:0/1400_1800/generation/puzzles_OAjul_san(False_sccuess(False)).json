When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I'll analyze this position carefully to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the material and position:\n- Material: White has a rook, bishop, knight, and 5 pawns. Black has a rook, bishop, knight, and 4 pawns. So material is roughly equal.\n- Position: White's rook on h5 is active, and the knight on e5 is centralized. Black's king on g8 looks somewhat exposed.\n\nLet me consider tactical opportunities:\n1. Knight captures: The e5 knight can capture on f7, g6, or g4, potentially winning material.\n2. Rook threats: The h5 rook could potentially deliver check or threaten Black's pieces.\n3. Discovered attacks: Moving the knight might create threats with the rook.\n\nAnalyzing specific candidate moves:\n\n1. **e5f7**: Knight captures rook. This is a direct material gain, winning a rook for a knight.\n\n2. **h5h8+**: This is a check, but after Kf7, White has no follow-up and has lost the attacking rook.\n\n3. **e5g6**: Knight captures pawn with check. After the king moves, the knight is hanging.\n\n4. **e5g4**: Knight captures knight. This is an even exchange but might open lines for attack.\n\n5. **h5h6**: Threatens the g6 pawn but doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n\nThe move **e5f7** stands out as clearly the strongest, as it wins a rook for a knight - a clear material advantage. After Black recaptures with Kxf7, White will be up the exchange (rook vs. knight).\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
