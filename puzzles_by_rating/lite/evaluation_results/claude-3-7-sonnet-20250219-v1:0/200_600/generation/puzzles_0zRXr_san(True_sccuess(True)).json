Rxg6+ - attacking the pawn with discovered attack on the king\n2. Rxc5 - capturing the undefended queen\n\nLet me analyze these and other candidate moves:\n\n1. Rxg6+:\nAfter hxg6, I don't see an immediate follow-up that wins material or leads to checkmate. Black's king gets an escape square on h7.\n\n2. Rxc5:\nThis simply wins a queen for a rook, giving me a decisive material advantage.\n\n3. Qh8+:\nForces Kf8, but doesn't lead to an immediate win.\n\n4. Qg7+:\nForces Kxg7, but I lose my queen without compensation.\n\nThe move Rxc5 stands out as clearly the strongest. I capture Black's queen for the price of a rook, which gives me a winning material advantage. After this capture, I'll be up a queen for a rook, which should be easily winning with proper technique.\n\n```\nRxc5\n```"
