After Kxh7, I could play Qh5+ followed by Qxg4, winning back material while maintaining an attack.\n\n2. **Qxf6**: Capturing the knight would win material directly, but after gxf6, Black's pawn structure would be strengthened and the g-file opened for the rook.\n\n3. **Qxg4**: This would win the bishop but loses the queen to Nxg4.\n\n4. **O-O**: Castling would secure my king and connect my rooks.\n\nLet me analyze the most promising line - the knight sacrifice:\n\nAfter 1. Nxh7:\n- If 1...Kxh7, then 2. Qh5+ Kg8 3. Qxg4 and I've won a bishop\n- If Black doesn't capture with 1...Kh8, I can retreat with 2. Nf6+ and I've gained a tempo\n\nThis is a classic Greek Gift sacrifice pattern that looks very strong here. Let's double-check:\n\n1. Nxh7 Kxh7\n2. Qh5+ Kg8\n3. Qxg4\n\nI've won a bishop for a knight, and Black's king position is weakened. If instead:\n\n1. Nxh7 Kh8\n2. Nf6+ gxf6 (forced)\n3. Qxf6+ and I'm threatening mate on h8\n\nThe knight sacrifice on h7 is clearly the strongest move in the position, leading to a material advantage and a powerful attack.\n\n```\nNxh7\n```"
