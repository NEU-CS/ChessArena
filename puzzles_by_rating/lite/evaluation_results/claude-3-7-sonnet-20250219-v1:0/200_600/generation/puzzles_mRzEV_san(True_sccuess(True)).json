When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material is roughly equal.\n- White's e5 and d5 pawns are advanced and controlling central space.\n- Black's queen on b4 is active and potentially threatening.\n- Black's bishop on f3 is attacking White's queen and g2 pawn.\n- White's bishop on a4 is somewhat exposed.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. The bishop on f3 is attacking my queen and g2 pawn - this needs to be addressed.\n2. Black's queen on b4 is active and could create threats.\n3. My central pawns give me space advantage.\n\nCandidate moves:\n1. Qxf3 - Capturing the bishop removes the immediate threat.\n2. gxf3 - Alternative capture, but weakens pawn structure.\n3. Qd4 - Moves the queen to safety while controlling the center.\n4. exf6 - Advances a pawn with capture, potentially weakening Black's king position.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the best move is to capture the bishop with the queen. This removes the immediate threat while maintaining material equality and keeping my queen active.\n\n```\nQxf3\n```"
