This is a check that forces the Black king to move, after which White can capture the undefended rook on c4 with the knight.\n\nLet's analyze this sequence:\n1. Rxb7+ - Black's king must move, likely to d8\n2. Nxc4 - White captures the undefended rook\n\nThis would give White a decisive material advantage (up a full rook).\n\nLet me check for any other strong candidates:\n- Rd7+ looks interesting but after Kxb6, White doesn't gain material\n- Rc6+ forces the king to move but doesn't lead to immediate material gain\n- Nxc4 directly would lose the knight to the king\n\nThe Rxb7+ tactic stands out as clearly the strongest move, as it forces the king to move and allows White to capture a rook for free on the next move.\n\n```\nRxb7+\n```"
