If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

My king is in check from the rook on f1, and the only way to get out of check is to capture that rook.\n\nLet me evaluate what happens after Kxf1:\n- I'll have captured one of Black's rooks\n- However, my position remains extremely difficult\n- Black's queen on e5 and bishop on f4 are well-positioned for an attack\n- Black's other rook on e8 can also join the attack\n\nSince I only have one legal move, there's no need to consider alternatives. I must play Kxf1.\n\n```\nKxf1\n```"
