If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Let me first understand the current state of the board.\n\nLooking at the FEN notation, I can see that I'm playing as White, and the position appears quite complex. Let me assess the material and positional situation:\n\nWhite has: a rook on e5 and a1, a queen on d1, knights on a3 and f3, pawns on a4, c2, f3, g2, and the king on h1.\nBlack has: a rook on h2 (directly attacking my king), a rook on c8, a queen on d8, a bishop on c5, a knight on b4, pawns on a6, b7, d5, e6, h7, and the king on g8.\n\nI notice that Black's rook is on h2, directly attacking my king. In fact, I'm in check. Looking at the legal moves provided, I only have one option: Kxh2 (capturing the rook with my king).\n\nThis is a forced move since I'm in check and have no other way to address it. I must capture the rook with my king.\n\nAfter Kxh2, I'll need to be careful about potential follow-ups from Black. My king will be somewhat exposed, but at least I'll have removed the immediate threat and gained material (a rook).\n\n```\nKxh2\n```"
