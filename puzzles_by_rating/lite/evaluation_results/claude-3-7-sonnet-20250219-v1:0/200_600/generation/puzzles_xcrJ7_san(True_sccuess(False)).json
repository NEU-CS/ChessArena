If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

I'm down material.\n2) King positions: My king is on b1, White's king is on c3.\n3) White's rook is on a7, threatening to capture my f7 pawn.\n4) My bishop is on e6, and I have pawns on f7, g6, h5, and b3.\n\nLet me evaluate the key legal moves:\n\n- **King moves**: `Kc1` would move away from the edge but stays in the same file as White's king.\n- **Bishop moves**: Several options to consider for activity and defense.\n- **Pawn moves**: `b2` advances my passed pawn, which could be crucial.\n\nThe passed b-pawn is my strongest asset. If I can advance it safely toward promotion, that's likely my best winning chance.\n\nLet's check `b2`:\n- After b2, White's king can't capture it directly.\n- If White tries to stop my pawn with Kc2, I can play Kc1 and we have a standoff.\n- Meanwhile, White's rook might capture on f7, but my b-pawn would be very dangerous.\n\nThe bishop moves don't seem to create immediate threats or significantly improve my position.\n\nPawn moves like `f5` or `g5` don't seem to create meaningful counterplay.\n\nAfter careful analysis, advancing my passed pawn with `b2` appears to be the strongest move, creating the most practical winning chances by forcing White to deal with my promotion threat.\n\n```\nb2\n```"
