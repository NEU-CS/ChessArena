If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Material advantage: I should try to preserve my bishop advantage\n2. King safety: My king on g1 needs to be careful of the rook on c2\n3. Counterplay: I need to create threats to counter Black's queenside pawns\n\nCandidate moves:\n- Bxc6: Captures a pawn but loses the bishop for a pawn, reducing my advantage\n- Rh8: Moves to the back rank but doesn't create immediate threats\n- Bd5: Controls important squares and prepares to stop the queenside pawns\n- Rxf6: Captures a pawn, maintaining material advantage\n\nLooking deeper at Rxf6:\n- After Rxf6, Black's king is nearby and could potentially capture\n- But this would give me time to activate my bishop and create threats elsewhere\n- The f6 pawn is currently defended only by the king\n\nLooking at Bd5:\n- This move controls key squares\n- Prepares to stop Black's queenside pawns\n- Maintains pressure and doesn't risk material\n\nI believe the best move is Bd5, as it maintains my material advantage while improving my piece position and preparing to counter Black's queenside pawns.\n\n```\nBd5\n```"
