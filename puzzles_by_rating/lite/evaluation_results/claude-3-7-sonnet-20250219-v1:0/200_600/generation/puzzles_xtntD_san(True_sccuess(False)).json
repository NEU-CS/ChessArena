When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black's rook on e2 is a major threat that needs to be addressed immediately\n2. I need to either capture it or defend against its threats\n3. I should look for any tactical opportunities\n\nLooking at the legal moves:\n- Bxe2 would capture the intruding rook, which seems very strong\n- Rxe2 would also capture the rook, but would allow Black to recapture with the bishop\n- Other moves would leave the dangerous rook on e2\n\nAnalyzing Bxe2:\n- I capture Black's rook with my bishop\n- Black would likely recapture with the other rook: Rxe2\n- This would leave me with a rook vs. bishop and rook, still down material but having eliminated the immediate threat\n\nAnalyzing Rxe2:\n- I capture Black's rook with my rook\n- Black would recapture with the bishop: Bxe2\n- This would leave me with a bishop vs. rook, still down material\n\nThe Bxe2 option is clearly better as it forces Black to use the second rook for recapture rather than maintaining both rooks on the board.\n\n```\nBxe2\n```"
