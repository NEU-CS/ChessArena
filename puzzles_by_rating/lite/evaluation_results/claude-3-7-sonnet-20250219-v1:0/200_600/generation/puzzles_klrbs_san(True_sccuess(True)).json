When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black has a queen, two rooks, and several pawns.\n- Black's queen is on e1, directly threatening my king on a1\n- I have only two legal moves: Qxe1 or Qc1\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Option 1: Qxe1**\nIf I capture Black's queen, I eliminate the immediate threat to my king. After Qxe1, Black would likely recapture with one of the rooks, probably Re1. This would leave me with no queen against Black's two rooks.\n\n**Option 2: Qc1**\nIf I play Qc1, I'm blocking the check but not capturing anything. Black could then capture my queen with Qxc1#, delivering checkmate since my king has no escape squares.\n\nComparing the options:\n- Qxe1 loses my queen but I capture Black's queen, leaving me in a rook vs queen disadvantage but still with play\n- Qc1 leads to immediate checkmate\n\nThe choice is clear - I must capture the queen to avoid immediate checkmate.\n\n```\nQxe1\n```"
