After Rxd4, White could play cxd4, and Black would have gained a pawn.\n\n2. **Nxd4**: Similar idea, but using the knight. After Nxd4, White would likely play cxd4, and Black gains a pawn.\n\n3. **Qxg2+**: This is a direct check that captures a pawn. Let's analyze this further. After Qxg2+, White must respond with Kxg2, and Black could follow up with something like Re6 preparing to double rooks on the g-file.\n\n4. **exd4**: Opening the e-file for the rooks and winning a pawn. After exd4, White would likely play cxd4, and Black's rooks would have the open e-file.\n\n5. **Re6**: Developing the rook to a more active position, potentially preparing for an attack on the kingside.\n\nAmong these options, **Qxg2+** stands out as it forces White to move the king, captures a pawn, and creates immediate pressure. This check disrupts White's position and gives Black the initiative.\n\n```\nQxg2+\n```"
