When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

I'm playing as Black, and I have only one legal move: Nxd8.\n\nLet's assess the current position:\n- Material: I (Black) have a knight, rook, and queen vs White's rook, queen, and knight. Material is roughly equal.\n- My king is on g8, somewhat exposed.\n- White has a rook on d8 that's attacking my position.\n- I have a knight on c6 that can capture White's rook on d8.\n- My queen is on h3, which might be applying some pressure.\n\nSince I only have one legal move (Nxd8), I need to understand why and what will happen after:\n- My knight on c6 can capture White's rook on d8.\n- After I capture, White will likely recapture with their queen on b5 (Qxd8+), putting me in check.\n- I'll need to respond to that check, likely by moving my king.\n\nGiven that I have only one legal move, I must play it regardless of the consequences:\n\n```\nNxd8\n```"
