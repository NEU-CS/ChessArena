The c5 pawn is a potential asset that could advance to c6\n2. Black's rook on d5 is threatening the e5 pawn\n3. White's rook on b1 is currently not very active\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- Advancing the c-pawn with c6 creates a dangerous passed pawn\n- Moving the bishop to protect the e5 pawn (Bd4) could be considered\n- Activating the rook with moves like Rb7 or Rxb8\n\nThe c6 push stands out as particularly strong. It creates a protected passed pawn that will require Black's attention and could become a decisive factor. This pawn advance also gives White's pieces more freedom to maneuver.\n\n```\nc6\n```"
