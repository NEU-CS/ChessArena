So I'm up a minor piece.\n- My king on h1 is under threat from Black's rook on e1.\n- Black has a rook on e8 as well.\n- I have three legal moves, all of which must address the immediate threat to my king.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n1. **Nf1**: This blocks the check by interposing the knight between my king and the enemy rook. However, the knight would be pinned against my king and could be captured by the rook, leading to material loss.\n\n2. **Bg1**: This blocks the check by interposing the bishop. Similar to the knight move, the bishop would be pinned and could be captured, leading to material loss.\n\n3. **Bxe1**: This captures the checking rook directly. After this capture, I would still be up material (a knight and bishop vs. a rook).\n\nComparing these options:\n- Both Nf1 and Bg1 lead to material loss as the interposing piece would be pinned and captured.\n- Bxe1 eliminates the immediate threat and maintains my material advantage.\n\nThe best move is clearly to capture the attacking rook:\n\n```\nBxe1\n```"
