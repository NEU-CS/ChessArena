Rb6+ immediately checks the king, forcing it to move\n2. Rc6+ similar to Rb6+, checks the king\n3. Advancing the f-pawn with f5 to prepare promotion\n4. Using my bishop to control key squares\n5. Coordinating my rooks to restrict the enemy king\n\nThe most direct approach is to use my material advantage to restrict the opponent's king and force checkmate. Since the opponent's king is already on the edge of the board, I can use my rooks to limit its movement.\n\nRb6+ seems particularly strong as it forces the king to move to either a5 or a7, after which I can continue to restrict its movement with my other pieces. This check immediately reduces the king's mobility and begins an attack sequence.\n\nAfter Rb6+, if Ka5, I can follow with Rc5+ forcing the king to a4, and then I can work toward a checkmate pattern.\n\n```\nRb6+\n```"
