When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

The position shows:\n- My king is on b8\n- I have a rook on g8\n- White has rooks on e1 and e8\n- White's king is on g2\n- Various pawns for both sides\n\nThe most striking feature is that White's rook is on e8, directly attacking my king on b8. This is check.\n\nLegal moves: Only \"Rxe8\" is listed as a legal move.\n\nThis makes sense because:\n1. My king is in check from White's rook on e8\n2. I cannot move my king as there are no safe squares\n3. I cannot block the check with any piece\n4. The only option is to capture the checking piece with my rook on g8\n\nSince there is only one legal move available to me, I must play it:\n\n```\nRxe8\n```"
