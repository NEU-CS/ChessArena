It also controls key central squares.\n\n2. **Bxh6**: Opening the kingside, but Black hasn't castled yet so this might not be as effective.\n\n3. **Qa4+**: This check forces Black to block with b5 or move the king, delaying castling.\n\n4. **d5**: Attacking the center and the e6 pawn, potentially opening lines.\n\nAnalyzing the strongest options:\n\n**Nd5** looks very strong because:\n- It directly attacks the undefended queen on d6\n- If Black moves the queen, Nxe7 forks the king and rook\n- It controls important central squares\n- It creates immediate tactical pressure\n\nThis is clearly the most forcing and tactically strong move in the position. Black will likely have to respond by moving the queen or capturing the knight with the e-pawn, both of which favor White.\n\n```\nNd5\n```"
