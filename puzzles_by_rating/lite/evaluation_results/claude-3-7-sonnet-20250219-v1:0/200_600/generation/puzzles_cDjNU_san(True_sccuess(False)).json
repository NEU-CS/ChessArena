        "content": "I'll analyze this position step by step to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material: White has two rooks and a knight vs Black's rook. White is up a minor piece.\n- King safety: Both kings are relatively safe.\n- Pawn structure: Black has more pawns on the kingside, but they're somewhat weak.\n- Piece activity: White's rooks and knight are active and can target Black's weaknesses.\n\nLet me evaluate some candidate moves:\n\n1. **Nxf7**: Captures a pawn and attacks the rook on d8. After Rxf7, White is still up a piece.\n\n2. **Nd7**: Directly attacks the rook, but Black can simply play Rxd7.\n\n3. **Nxg6**: Captures a pawn and opens up Black's king position.\n\n4. **Nxc6**: Captures a pawn and attacks the king, forcing it to move.\n\n5. **Rxc6**: Captures a pawn but allows the king to capture the rook.\n\nLooking at these options, Nxc6 stands out as particularly strong. It captures a pawn with check, forcing the king to move, after which White can continue to press the advantage.\n\nAfter Nxc6+ Kxc6, White can follow up with Re6+ forking the king and e-pawn. This would win additional material and further increase White's advantage.\n\nThe move Nxc6+ creates an immediate tactical threat and increases White's material advantage, which aligns with the goal of pressing the advantage relentlessly.\n\n```\nNxc6\n```"
