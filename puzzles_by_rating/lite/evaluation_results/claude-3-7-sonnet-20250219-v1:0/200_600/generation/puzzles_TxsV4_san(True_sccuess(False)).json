After Qxg4, Black has no immediate compensation. This is a clean material gain.\n\n**Nf5**: This attacks the queen, forcing it to move, and also threatens the e7 bishop. However, Black can play Qd7 and still defend everything.\n\n**Nxe6**: This wins a bishop for a knight, but after fxe6, Black's position becomes more open, which could give counterplay.\n\n**Bf4**: This just moves the bishop away from attack but doesn't gain anything.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the move **Qxg4** stands out as the strongest. It wins material cleanly without giving Black any immediate counterplay. Capturing the knight improves White's material advantage and removes an active piece from Black's position.\n\n```\nQxg4\n```"
