If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Black's queen is attacking my king, and I must address this immediate threat. Since Qxf1 is my only legal move, I must capture the queen.\n\nAfter Qxf1, I'll have traded queens, which should help stabilize the position somewhat, though I'll need to be careful about Black's remaining pieces.\n\n```\nQxf1\n```"
