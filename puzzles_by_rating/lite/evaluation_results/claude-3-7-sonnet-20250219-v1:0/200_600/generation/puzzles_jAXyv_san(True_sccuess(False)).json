This is not good.\n\n2. **fxg4**: Capturing the knight would open the f-file, but White can recapture with hxg5, creating a passed h-pawn and weakening Black's kingside.\n\n3. **Qg5**: This move pressures the h4 pawn and moves the queen away from the g4 knight's attack. It also maintains control of important central squares.\n\n4. **Bd7**: Developing the bishop and connecting the rooks is a solid positional move.\n\n5. **e5**: This pushes back the knight and gains space in the center, but might weaken the d5 square.\n\n6. **Qh6**: This threatens the h4 pawn while maintaining pressure on the kingside.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the most promising moves are Qg5 and Bd7. Qg5 applies immediate pressure on White's h4 pawn while moving away from the knight's attack. Bd7 improves piece coordination.\n\nBetween these two, I believe Qg5 is more active and creates immediate threats while addressing the knight's attack on f6.\n\n```\nQg5\n```"
