When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

However, the queen can simply move away, and I don't see an immediate follow-up that would lead to a decisive advantage.\n\n**Qf1**:\nThis move trades queens. After Qxf1, I would have a completely winning endgame with rook and bishop vs nothing. The material advantage would be overwhelming.\n\nLet me check if there's any tactical reason not to trade queens:\n- After Qf1, Black must play Qxf1+ (forced)\n- I recapture with Rxf1, and I'm up a rook and bishop with no counterplay for Black\n- Black's king is cut off on the h-file, making it easy to promote pawns\n\nThe position after the queen trade would be completely winning for White, as I'd have a rook and bishop advantage with no compensation for Black.\n\n```\nQf1\n```"
