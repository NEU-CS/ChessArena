After Rxe2, White must respond to the threat.\n\n2. **Rxb3**: Captures a pawn but allows White to recapture with the knight.\n\n3. **Bxg3**: Captures a pawn but allows hxg3, strengthening White's pawn structure.\n\n4. **Bf4**: Controls important squares but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\nLooking at **Rxe2** more deeply:\n- If White plays Rxe2, Black can play Rb3+ winning the knight\n- If White plays Kxe2, Black has Rb3 threatening the knight\n- This creates a very strong tactical sequence\n\nThe move **Rxe2** stands out as clearly the best as it wins material and creates tactical threats. It forces White to make difficult decisions and gives Black a clear advantage.\n\n```\nRxe2\n```"
