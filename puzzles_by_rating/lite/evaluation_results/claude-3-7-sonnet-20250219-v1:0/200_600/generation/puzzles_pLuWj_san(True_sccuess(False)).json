If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Black's queen on d4 is a powerful piece that needs to be addressed\n2. I have a potential checkmate threat with Bh7+ followed by Rc8-g8#\n3. I should look for forcing moves that improve my position\n\nLet me evaluate the most promising moves:\n\n1. Bh7+ looks very strong as it forces the king to move, after which I can follow up with a rook check on the 8th rank. After Bh7+ Kh8, I can play Rc8+ and Black must block with Bf8, after which I can capture with Rxf8#.\n\n2. Rxf8+ immediately captures the bishop, but after Kxf8, I don't have an immediate follow-up. This simplifies but doesn't lead to a forced win.\n\n3. Re8 threatens the bishop but allows Black to move it away.\n\nThe Bh7+ line seems clearly strongest as it leads to a forced checkmate sequence:\n1. Bh7+ Kh8\n2. Rc8+ Bf8\n3. Rxf8#\n\n```\nBh7+\n```"
