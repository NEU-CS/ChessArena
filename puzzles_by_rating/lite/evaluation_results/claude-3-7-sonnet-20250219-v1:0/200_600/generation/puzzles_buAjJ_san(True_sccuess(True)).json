If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a queen on d8, knights on f6 and f3, rooks on g4 and f1, and various pawns.\n\nThe legal moves list contains only one option: Bxd8 (capturing White's queen with my bishop).\n\nLet me evaluate this position:\n1. Material: White has a queen, two knights, two rooks, and several pawns. I (Black) have a rook, two bishops, a queen, and pawns. White is currently up in material.\n2. My king appears to be under attack, with White's knight on f6 and rook on g4 pointing toward my king's position.\n3. I have only one legal move: Bxd8, which means capturing White's queen with my bishop (likely the bishop on c6).\n\nSince I only have one legal move, there's no need to compare multiple options. Capturing White's queen is clearly the best (and only) choice, as it will significantly reduce White's attacking potential and improve my material situation.\n\n```\nBxd8\n```"
