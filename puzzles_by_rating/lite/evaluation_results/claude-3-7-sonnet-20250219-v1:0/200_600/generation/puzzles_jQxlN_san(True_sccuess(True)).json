If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Material: I'm down material (White has Q, R, R, B, N, N vs my Q, R, R, B, B, N)\n2. My king is under attack - White's knight on f6 is checking me\n3. White's queen on h5 is threatening my position\n4. I only have two legal responses to the check\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Option 1: Kf8**\nIf I move my king to f8, I escape the check, but White can play Qxh6+ attacking my king again. After Kg8, White has Qxg7# which is checkmate. So Kf8 leads to a forced mate.\n\n**Option 2: Bxf6**\nIf I capture the knight with my bishop, I remove the checking piece. White would likely recapture with Qxf6, maintaining the attack on my position. However, this at least gives me a fighting chance to continue the game, even though I'm still in a very difficult position.\n\nAfter Bxf6 Qxf6, White threatens mate on f7, but I could potentially defend with moves like Qe7 (blocking the attack).\n\nBetween these two options, Bxf6 is clearly better as Kf8 leads to a forced mate.\n\n```\nBxf6\n```"
