        "content": "I need to analyze this endgame position carefully. Let me assess the situation:\n\nCurrent position:\n- White has a king on b5 and a pawn on b4\n- Black has a king on g4 and a pawn on h5\n- It's White's turn to move\n\nThis is a king and pawn endgame where both sides have a pawn. The key factors to consider are:\n1. Pawn advancement and promotion potential\n2. King position and activity\n3. Opposition and zugzwang possibilities\n\nLet me analyze each legal move:\n\n1. **Pawn race assessment**: \n   - White's b-pawn needs 4 moves to promote (b5-b8)\n   - Black's h-pawn needs 3 moves to promote (h5-h1)\n   - So Black's pawn is faster in a direct race\n\n2. **King positions**:\n   - White's king is closer to Black's pawn than Black's king is to White's pawn\n   - White's king could potentially catch Black's pawn\n\nLet me evaluate each move:\n\n- **Kc6**: Moves away from both pawns, not optimal\n- **Kb6**: Moves away from both pawns, not optimal\n- **Ka6**: Moves away from both pawns, not optimal\n- **Kc5**: Moves diagonally, not making progress toward Black's pawn\n- **Ka5**: Moves diagonally, not making progress toward Black's pawn\n- **Kc4**: Moves toward the center and Black's pawn, good\n- **Ka4**: Moves away from Black's pawn, not optimal\n\nThe key insight is that White needs to race toward Black's h-pawn while Black's king is far away. The most direct path is to go via c4, d5, e6, f7, etc.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nKc4\n```"
