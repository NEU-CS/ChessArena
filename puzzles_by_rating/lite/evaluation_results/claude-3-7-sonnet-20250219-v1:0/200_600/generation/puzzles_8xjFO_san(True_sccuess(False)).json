If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Black has two rooks that can coordinate for an attack\n2. White's king is exposed on e2, which could be vulnerable to checks\n3. The rook on h3 is already putting pressure on the e3 pawn\n4. The rook on f6 could be repositioned for a more active role\n\nLooking at the legal moves, I notice some attacking opportunities:\n- Rxe3+ would win a pawn immediately\n- Rf2+ gives a check but after Kd3 or Ke1, White's king escapes\n- Rh2+ is a check but after Kd3 or Kf1, there's no immediate follow-up\n\nThe move Rxe3+ stands out as it:\n1. Captures a pawn, increasing Black's material advantage\n2. Gives check, forcing White's king to move\n3. After White's king moves (likely to d1, d2, or f1), Black can continue the attack with the second rook\n\nThis is clearly the most forcing and advantageous move in the position.\n\n```\nRxe3+\n```"
