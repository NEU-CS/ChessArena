If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

White's queen on h6 is threatening mate on f8 or h8. I need to move my king immediately.\n\nLegal moves are only Kg8 and Ke8. Let me analyze each:\n\n1. Kg8:\n   - This moves the king to the g-file, which is still in the range of the white queen.\n   - After Kg8, White could play Qh7+ followed by Qh8# next move.\n   - This is clearly losing.\n\n2. Ke8:\n   - This moves the king away from the h-file and the immediate threat.\n   - The white queen can't deliver an immediate checkmate.\n   - The king is safer on e8 and can potentially escape to d8 later if needed.\n\nKe8 is clearly the better move as it avoids the immediate checkmate threat. The king moves away from the dangerous h-file and gains some breathing room.\n\n```\nKe8\n```"
