When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Black has a rook, rook, queen, knight, and 6 pawns. Material is roughly equal, but the position has tactical elements.\n\nKey features of the position:\n- Black's knight on e3 is threatening White's queen\n- White's f5 pawn is advanced and potentially strong\n- Black has a passed d-pawn\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\nLet me consider candidate moves:\n\n1. Qxe3: Capturing the knight seems natural, but after dxe3, White loses material.\n\n2. Rxd4: This captures Black's passed pawn, but after Qxd4, White would need to retreat the queen from the attack.\n\n3. Qxd4: Directly capturing the pawn and removing the threat, but Black can play Qxd4 and we trade queens.\n\n4. Ng5: This threatens Black's queen and attacks the f7 square.\n\n5. Ne5: This attacks Black's queen and controls key central squares.\n\nI think Ne5 is the strongest move. It attacks Black's queen, threatens to fork the king and rook with Ng6+, and controls important central squares. The knight on e5 would be very powerful.\n\n```\nNe5\n```"
