If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

After Bg1, Black could capture my bishop with Rxg1+, forcing my king to move. This would leave me in a very difficult position with my king exposed.\n\n**Option 2: Rxf1**\nThis move captures the checking rook with my rook. After Rxf1, I eliminate the immediate threat. Black might respond with moves like Qxc6 (capturing my rook) or other attacking options, but at least I've removed the checking piece.\n\nComparing the two:\n- Bg1 merely blocks the check temporarily but loses material after Rxg1+\n- Rxf1 eliminates the threat permanently by capturing the attacking piece\n\nThe choice is clear - capturing the rook is much better than blocking with the bishop only to lose it immediately afterward.\n\n```\nRxf1\n```"
