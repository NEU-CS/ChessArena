Nxe6 fxe6 2. Qxg4, White wins a knight for a pawn. If Black plays 1...Qxe6 instead, then 2. Nf5 wins the queen. This is clearly winning for White.\n\n**Qxg4**:\nAfter 1. Qxg4 hxg4 (or any other capture), Black loses a piece but doesn't face the devastating fork.\n\n**Nf5**:\nThis attacks the queen, but after 1. Nf5 Qd7, Black's position remains intact.\n\nThe knight fork on e6 is clearly the strongest move, winning material with no adequate defense for Black. This is a classic tactical motif in chess.\n\n```\nNxe6\n```"
