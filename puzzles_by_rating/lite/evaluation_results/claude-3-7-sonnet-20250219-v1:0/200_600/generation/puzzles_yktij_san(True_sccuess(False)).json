Let me assess the current state of the board:\n\n1) Material count:\n   - Black has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, Queen, and pawns\n   - White has: Rook, Bishop, Knight, and pawns\n   - Material is roughly even\n\n2) Key positional factors:\n   - White's rook is on e5, attacking my queen on c5\n   - White's knight on d4 is centralized and strong\n   - My knight on c3 is active and threatening White's position\n   - White's king is on g1, somewhat exposed\n   - My king is on g8\n\n3) Tactical opportunities:\n   - My knight on c3 is attacking White's pawn on a2\n   - I have a check with Qxg2+\n   - My knight can fork with Ne2+, hitting White's king and rook\n\nLet me evaluate the most promising moves:\n\n1) Qxg2+ looks tempting but after Kxg2, I don't see a clear follow-up that gains material.\n\n2) Ne2+ is a knight fork attacking both the king and rook. After Kh1 (forced), I can capture the rook with Nxe5. This wins a full rook for a knight, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n3) Defensive moves like Kh8 or Qd6 don't address the threats or create counterplay.\n\nThe knight fork with Ne2+ is clearly the strongest move, winning material with a forced sequence.\n\n```\nNe2+\n```"
