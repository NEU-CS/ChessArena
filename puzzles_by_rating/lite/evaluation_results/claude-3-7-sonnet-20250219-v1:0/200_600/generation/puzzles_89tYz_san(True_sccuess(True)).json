Pawn promotion race: White's pawns are much more advanced than Black's b3 pawn\n2. King position: White's king is supporting the pawns, while Black's king is far away\n3. Opposition: Need to consider king moves carefully to maintain control\n\nCandidate moves analysis:\n1. Advancing pawns (h6 or g5):\n   - Advancing pawns is generally good to get closer to promotion\n   - h6 would create a protected passed pawn\n   - g5 would strengthen the pawn structure\n\n2. King moves:\n   - Need to support the pawns' advance\n   - Should stay close to the pawns\n   - Kg5 would directly protect the g-pawn\n\nThe most direct winning plan is to advance the pawns with king support. Since the black king is far away, we can safely push our pawns.\n\nBetween h6 and g5, advancing the h-pawn to h6 seems strongest as it's already more advanced and closer to promotion. The king should stay nearby to support both pawns.\n\n```\nh6\n```"

Black's b-pawn is trying to promote, and White needs to either stop it or win the race with their own pawns.\n\nLet's calculate:\n1. If Black's b-pawn queens, it will take 5 moves (b1=Q)\n2. White's h-pawn needs 2 moves to promote (h7, h8=Q)\n3. White's g-pawn needs 4 moves to promote (g5, g6, g7, g8=Q)\n\nWhite is clearly winning the race. The best strategy is to push the h-pawn immediately, as it's closest to promotion.\n\nIf I play h7, Black's king is too far away to stop it from promoting next move. After h7, Black will push b1=Q, but then I'll have h8=Q with check, and I'll be able to capture Black's new queen next move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh7\n```"
