Let me break down what we have:\n\n- White has a king on b5 and a pawn on b4\n- Black has a king on g4 and a pawn on h5\n- It's White's turn to move\n\nThis is a pawn race situation where both sides are trying to promote their pawns. Let me analyze the key factors:\n\n1) Distance to promotion: \n   - White's pawn needs 4 moves to reach b8\n   - Black's pawn needs 3 moves to reach h1\n\n2) King positions:\n   - White's king is far from Black's pawn\n   - Black's king is far from White's pawn\n\nLet me calculate the race:\n- If White pushes the pawn without king support: b4-b5-b6-b7-b8 (4 moves)\n- If Black pushes the pawn without king support: h5-h4-h3-h2-h1 (4 moves)\n\nHowever, Black's king is closer to supporting its pawn. I need to either:\n1) Race with my pawn and try to queen first\n2) Use my king to support my pawn's advance\n\nLet me check the key squares. For the b-pawn to promote safely, I need to control b8. The most direct path is to advance my king toward b8 while pushing the pawn.\n\nAmong the legal moves:\n- Kc6 advances toward the promotion square\n- Kb6 advances toward the promotion square\n- Ka6 moves sideways, not optimal\n- Kc5, Ka5, Kc4, Ka4 all move away from the promotion square\n\nThe best move is to advance my king toward the queening square while keeping close to my pawn:\n\n```\nKc6\n```"

This is a king and pawn endgame where both sides have a pawn\n2. White's pawn is on b4, closer to promotion than Black's h4 pawn\n3. White's king is centralized while Black's king is far away on g4\n4. The key question is whether White can promote the b-pawn before Black can stop it or promote their own h-pawn\n\nLet me analyze the key candidate moves:\n\n1. **b5**: Advancing the pawn immediately. This creates a passed pawn that will require Black's attention.\n\n2. **Kd5/Kc5**: Moving toward Black's pawn to potentially stop it.\n\n3. **Kb5**: Supporting the pawn's advance.\n\nLet's calculate:\n- If I play b5, the pawn needs 3 more moves to promote (b6, b7, b8=Q)\n- Black's h-pawn needs 4 moves to promote (h3, h2, h1=Q)\n- So I'm ahead in the promotion race\n\nThe critical factor is whether I can support my pawn's advance while preventing Black from stopping it. Since Black's king is far away (g4), I should be able to promote first if I play correctly.\n\nThe most direct winning plan is to advance my pawn with support from my king. Since the b-pawn is already on b4, playing b5 immediately starts the race to promotion.\n\n```\nb5\n```"

This is a pawn race situation where both sides are trying to promote their pawns\n2. White's king is closer to Black's pawn than Black's king is to White's pawn\n3. The key question is whether White can promote the b-pawn before Black promotes the h-pawn\n\nLet me calculate the pawn race:\n- White needs 3 moves to promote: b6, b7, b8=Q\n- Black needs 2 moves to promote: h2, h1=Q\n\nHowever, White's king can potentially stop Black's pawn if I move quickly enough.\n\nLet me check the critical paths:\n- If White plays b6 immediately, Black plays h2, then White plays b7, Black plays h1=Q, and Black gets a queen first\n- White's king needs to approach the h-pawn while advancing the b-pawn\n\nThe most direct route to Black's h-pawn would be: Kd6-Ke5-Kf4-Kg3\n\nLet me check if I can catch the pawn:\n- Move 1: Kd6 (Black plays h2)\n- Move 2: Ke5 (Black promotes to h1=Q)\n- Too slow, Black queens first\n\nLet me try another approach:\n- Move 1: b6 (Black plays h2)\n- Move 2: b7 (Black promotes to h1=Q)\n- Move 3: b8=Q (But Black already has a queen and can likely force a draw or win)\n\nThe key insight is that I need to create a passed pawn while also approaching Black's pawn. The most efficient move is:\n\n```\nb6\n```\n\nThis advances my pawn while maintaining control of the queening square with my king. Even though Black will promote first, I'll promote shortly after, and with careful play, I should be able to force at least a draw in the resulting queen endgame."
