Black's rook on e1 is delivering check to my king on g1. In chess, when in check, I must:\n1. Capture the checking piece\n2. Block the check, or\n3. Move the king out of check\n\nLooking at my legal moves, I only have one option: Qxe1 (capturing the rook with my queen).\n\nAfter Qxe1, I'll have eliminated the immediate check threat. However, I need to consider what happens next. Black will likely play Qxe1, recapturing my queen. At that point, I'll have a bishop and pawns against Black's queen and pawns, which is a losing position for me.\n\nHowever, I notice my pawn on b7 is one move away from promotion. If I could somehow promote that pawn to a queen, I might have chances. But after Qxe1 Qxe1, I won't have time to promote as Black's queen will be active.\n\nSince I only have one legal move available (Qxe1), I must play it despite the unfavorable position afterward.\n\n```\nQxe1\n```"
