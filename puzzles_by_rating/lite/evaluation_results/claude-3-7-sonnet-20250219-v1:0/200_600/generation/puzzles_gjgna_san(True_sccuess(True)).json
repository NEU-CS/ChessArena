I'm playing as White, and according to the FEN notation and the list of legal moves, I only have one legal move available: Kh1.\n\nLet me assess the current position:\n- Material count: I have a queen, two rooks, two knights, a bishop, and seven pawns. Black has a queen, two rooks, a bishop, a knight, and seven pawns. So material is roughly equal.\n- My king is on h2, and Black's knight on f3 is giving check.\n- I only have one legal move to get out of check, which is Kh1.\n\nSince I have only one legal move, there's no need to evaluate alternatives. I must move my king from h2 to h1 to escape the check from the black knight on f3.\n\n```\nKh1\n```"
