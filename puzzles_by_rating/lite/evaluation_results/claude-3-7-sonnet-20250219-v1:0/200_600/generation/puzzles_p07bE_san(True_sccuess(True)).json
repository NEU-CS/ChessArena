If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

I'm playing as Black, and the position looks quite challenging.\n\nFirst, let's assess the position:\n- Material: I'm down a queen (White has a queen on d8, while I have a bishop on f6 and a queen on h4)\n- My king is on g8 and appears to be in a dangerous position\n- White's queen is on d8, which is a powerful attacking position\n- I only have one legal move: Bxd8\n\nSince I only have one legal move available (Bxd8), I don't need to compare multiple options. Let's analyze what happens after this move:\n\nAfter Bxd8, I'll capture White's queen with my bishop. This will equalize the material situation somewhat, as I'll have a bishop and queen versus White's remaining pieces. This is clearly the best (and only) move available to me.\n\n```\nBxd8\n```"
