If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

I'm playing as Black, and I need to assess the current state of the board.\n\nPosition assessment:\n- Material: I have a rook, while White has a rook and queen. I'm down a queen, which is a massive material disadvantage.\n- White's rook is on e6, threatening my d6 pawn.\n- White's queen on f5 is very active and threatening.\n- My king is on h8 with limited mobility.\n- My rook on f8 is my only active piece.\n\nImmediate threats:\n1. Qxf8# is a checkmate threat if I move my rook.\n2. Re8+ followed by Qf8# is another checkmate pattern.\n\nI'm in a very difficult position. Let me consider my options:\n\n1. Rxf5: Capturing the queen would be ideal, but after Rxf8#, I lose immediately.\n2. Rf7: Defends against Re8+, but White can play Qh5 threatening mate.\n3. Kg8: Moves my king, but after Re8+ Rf8 Rxf8+ Kxf8, I've lost my rook and still in a lost position.\n4. g6: Blocks the queen's diagonal to h7, but White can simply play Qg5 maintaining the threats.\n\nThe move g6 seems to offer the best practical chance by blocking the queen's access to h7, though the position remains very difficult.\n\n```\ng6\n```"
