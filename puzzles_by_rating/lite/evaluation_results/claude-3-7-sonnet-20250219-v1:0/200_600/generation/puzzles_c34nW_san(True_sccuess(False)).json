If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight, and some pawns.\n- Material count: Black has Q+R+5P (14 points), White has Q+R+B+N+3P (19 points), so Black is down by 5 points.\n- King safety: Black's king is somewhat exposed in the corner, White's king is also on the back rank.\n- Piece activity: White's pieces are quite active, with the rook on d6 and bishop on a6 putting pressure on Black's position.\n\nLet me examine the most promising moves:\n\n1. Qxf3: Capturing White's queen would equalize material, but is it safe? After Qxf3, White would play Rxc6, winning the rook and maintaining material advantage.\n\n2. Qe4+: This check forces the White king to move, but doesn't seem to lead to any immediate advantage.\n\n3. Qxd6: Taking White's rook would improve the material situation. After Qxd6, White might play Bxc8 Kxc8, and Black would be up a piece.\n\n4. Qxb5: Capturing the knight would improve material balance, but the bishop on a6 still controls c8, so White could play Bxc8 Kxc8.\n\n5. Rc8: Defending against the threat of Bxc8, but White could still play Rd8+ forcing the king to move and then capture the rook.\n\nLet me check Qxd6 more carefully:\nAfter Qxd6, White has Bxc8, then Kxc8, and White is still up material (Q+B+N vs Q+R).\n\nI think the best move is to capture White's rook with the queen, as it improves the material situation the most:\n\n```\nQxd6\n```"
