Material count: I (Black) have two rooks and two bishops (\u2248 13 points). White has two rooks, a knight, and a bishop (\u2248 14 points). So I'm slightly behind in material.\n2. My king is on e8, and White's rook is on d8, giving a check.\n3. I have only one legal move which is to capture that rook with my rook: Rxd8.\n\nSince I have only one legal move, there's no need to evaluate alternatives. I must capture the rook on d8 with my rook.\n\n```\nRxd8\n```"
