If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

Let me assess the current state of the board:\n\n1) Material count:\n   - Black has a rook and bishop (worth about 8 points)\n   - White has a rook and queen (worth about 14 points)\n   - Black is down significant material (about 6 points)\n\n2) Key threats:\n   - White's queen on e5 is threatening my rook on e8\n   - White's queen also controls many squares and threatens potential checkmates\n\n3) King safety:\n   - My king on g8 is somewhat exposed\n   - White's rook on d1 could join an attack along the open e-file\n\nLet me consider my options:\n\n- Rxe5: Capturing the queen would be ideal, but after Rd8+ I'd lose my rook and face checkmate threats\n- Bxb3: I could capture White's pawn, but this doesn't address the immediate threat to my rook\n- Moving the rook: I need to save my rook from capture, but where is best?\n- King moves: I could move my king to safety, but I'd lose my rook\n\nThe most pressing issue is saving my rook from the queen's attack. Let me analyze the rook moves:\n\n- Re7, Re6: These moves keep the rook on the e-file but don't threaten anything\n- Rf8: This protects the f7 pawn but blocks a king escape square\n- Rd8, Rc8, Rb8, Ra8: These moves abandon the e-file\n\nI think Rd8 is my best option. It:\n1) Saves the rook from immediate capture\n2) Controls the d-file which could be useful\n3) Prepares potential counterplay along the back rank\n4) Keeps my rook active rather than passive\n\n```\nRd8\n```"
