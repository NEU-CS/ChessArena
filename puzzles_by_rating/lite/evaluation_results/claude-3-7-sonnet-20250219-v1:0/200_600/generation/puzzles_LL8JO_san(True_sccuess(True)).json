If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Material: I (Black) have a queen, two rooks, a knight, a bishop, and several pawns. White has a queen, two rooks, a knight, a bishop, and several pawns.\n2. King safety: My king is on h8, and White's queen is on h7 with a knight on e7 supporting it.\n3. Threats: White's queen on h7 is directly threatening my king, and I'm in check.\n\nSince I only have one legal move (Kxh7), I must capture White's queen. After this capture, I'll have a significant material advantage by winning a queen for free.\n\nLet me check if there are any immediate threats after I capture the queen:\n- White's knight on e7 will be attacking my king on h7\n- White's rook on f3 controls the h3 square\n- White's bishop on e2 controls the h5 square\n\nAfter Kxh7, White might play Nf5+ forcing my king to move, but I don't see an immediate checkmate threat. With the material advantage of a queen, I should be able to win this game.\n\n```\nKxh7\n```"
