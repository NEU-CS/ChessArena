Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is well protected, while Black's king is somewhat exposed with the h-pawn missing.\n- Piece activity: White's bishop on h6 is attacking the g7 square next to Black's king, and the knight on f5 is well-positioned.\n- Threats: I notice White has a potential checkmate threat with Bg7+ followed by Qh5#.\n\nLet me examine this tactical opportunity:\n1. Bg7+ forces Kh8 (only legal move)\n2. Qh5 would be checkmate!\n\nThis is a clear forced mate in 2 moves. Let's double-check:\n- After Bg7+, Black must move the king to h8\n- Then Qh5# delivers checkmate as the queen attacks the king on h8, and Black has no way to block or capture\n\nThis is a decisive tactical blow that ends the game immediately. No need to consider other options when we have a forced mate.\n\n```\nBg7+\n```"
