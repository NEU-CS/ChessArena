If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: Black's king is on h8, somewhat exposed with White's rook on h5. White's king is on h3.\n- Piece activity: Black has a rook on a2 that's active, another on f8, and a bishop on c4.\n- Pawn structure: Black has several pawns that could become targets.\n\nKey observations:\n1. White's rook on h5 is threatening the h7 pawn\n2. Black has a powerful bishop on c4 controlling key diagonals\n3. Black's rook on a2 is active and potentially threatening\n4. White's king on h3 could be vulnerable to checks\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n1. **Rh2+**: This check forces the White king to move, potentially creating tactical opportunities.\n2. **Bf1+**: This check also forces the White king to move.\n3. **Ra3+**: This doesn't work as there's no check.\n\nLet's examine Rh2+ more closely:\n- If White responds with Kg3, Black can play Rg2+ followed by Rxg1\n- If White responds with Kg4, Black can play Rg2+ followed by Rxg1\n\nLet's examine Bf1+:\n- White must move the king, after which Black can potentially follow up with threats\n\nThe move Rh2+ seems particularly strong as it initiates a forcing sequence that could win material. It checks the king and threatens to capture the rook on g1.\n\n```\nRh2+\n```"
