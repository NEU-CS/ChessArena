After Kd1, Black's queen would be attacked by the rook on d3, forcing retreat without further immediate gains.\n\n`Bg5+`: After Kd1 or Kb1, the bishop is hanging and can be captured.\n\n`Qe4`: This threatens White's queen, but White can simply trade queens with Qxe4, which doesn't favor Black particularly.\n\n`Bd7`: Solid development move that improves piece coordination.\n\nLooking deeper at `Qxc2+`:\n1. Qxc2+\n2. Kd1 (forced)\n3. Qc4 (attacking the queen and threatening Qxd3+)\n\nThis sequence gives Black a pawn advantage and maintains pressure. The check forces White's king to move, giving Black tempo to reposition the queen to a safer square while maintaining threats.\n\n```\nQxc2+\n```"
