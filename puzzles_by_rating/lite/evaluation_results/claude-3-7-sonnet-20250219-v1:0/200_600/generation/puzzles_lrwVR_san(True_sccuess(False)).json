It's an active move that prevents Black's rooks from penetrating further.\n\n3. **Re3**: Similar to Re4, but less active and doesn't control as much space.\n\n4. **Rac1/Rad1**: Activating the a-rook, but doesn't address the immediate pressure on the e-file.\n\n5. **h4**: This move strengthens White's kingside but doesn't address the immediate tactical situation.\n\nAfter analyzing these options, I believe Re4 is the strongest move. It directly counters Black's pressure on the e-file, prevents the enemy rooks from penetrating to the 4th rank, and maintains an active position for White's rook. This move addresses the immediate tactical concerns while maintaining good strategic positioning.\n\n```\nRe4\n```"
