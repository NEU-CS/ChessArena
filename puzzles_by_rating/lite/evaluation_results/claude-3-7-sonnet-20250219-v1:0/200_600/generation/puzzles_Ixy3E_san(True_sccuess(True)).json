My rook on f2 is under attack by Black's queen\n4.

After this exchange, I'd be down a rook, and Black would have a winning advantage.\n\n**Option 2: Rxe1**\nIf I play Rxe1, I capture Black's queen. Black would likely recapture with Rxe1+, and then I'd need to move my king. This would leave us in a position where I have a queen and Black has a rook - giving me a significant material advantage.\n\nThe choice is clear - I need to capture the queen to avoid losing material.\n\n```\nRxe1\n```"
