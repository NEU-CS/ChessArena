After bxc5, Black would have a passed pawn on the b-file.\n\n2. **Re1+**: This checks the White king but after Kh2 or Kf1, it doesn't lead to any immediate advantage.\n\n3. **Re2**: This attacks White's f2 pawn, but White can defend with Rd2.\n\n4. **Re4**: This controls the 4th rank but doesn't create immediate threats.\n\n5. **King moves** (Kh8, Kf8): These are passive and don't improve Black's position.\n\n6. **Pawn moves**: None create immediate threats or significantly improve the position.\n\nThe most critical aspect of this position is White's passed c-pawn. If left unchecked, it could advance and become a serious threat. Capturing it eliminates this danger and creates a passed pawn for Black after the exchange.\n\nAfter 1. Rxc5 bxc5, Black has a slight advantage due to the passed b-pawn, which can be supported by the Black king. The rook endgame would favor Black slightly.\n\n```\nRxc5\n```"
