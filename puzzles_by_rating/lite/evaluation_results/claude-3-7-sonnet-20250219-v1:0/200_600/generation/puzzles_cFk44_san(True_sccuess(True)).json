If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

I'm playing as Black, and I need to determine the best move from the legal moves provided.\n\nFirst, let me assess the current position:\n- I'm playing as Black with my king on b8\n- White has a queen on g6, a rook on e8, and knights on f3\n- I have a rook on h8, a bishop on d6, a queen on b4, and a knight on d4\n- White is threatening my king with the rook on e8\n\nLooking at the legal moves provided, I only have one option: Rxe8 (capturing White's rook with my rook).\n\nLet me evaluate this move:\n1. Rxe8 would remove White's immediate threat to my king\n2. After Rxe8, I would have a rook on e8 protecting my king\n3. This is a forced move since it's the only legal move available\n\nSince I have only one legal move, there's no need to compare alternatives. Capturing the rook is necessary to protect my king from immediate checkmate.\n\n```\nRxe8\n```"
