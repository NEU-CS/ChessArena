Let me assess the current state of the board.\n\nFEN: 3rQ1k1/6pp/pb4n1/2p3q1/8/2P5/PP4PP/4RR1K b - - 1 27\n\nKey observations:\n- White has a queen on e8, threatening my rook on d8\n- I have a knight on g6 and a queen on g5\n- White's king is on h1, somewhat exposed\n- I only have two legal moves: Rxe8 or Nf8\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n1. Rxe8:\n   - I capture White's queen with my rook\n   - Material gain: +9 points (queen) - 5 points (rook) = +4 points\n   - This would be a significant material advantage\n\n2. Nf8:\n   - This blocks the white queen's attack on my rook\n   - But White can simply capture the knight with Qxf8+, forcing Rxf8\n   - After that exchange, I'd be down a knight for no compensation\n\nThe choice is clear. Capturing the queen with Rxe8 gives me a decisive material advantage. After this capture, I'll be up a queen for a rook, which should be winning with proper technique.\n\n```\nRxe8\n```"

Let me verify why this is the only option:\n- I must get out of check\n- I can't capture the checking rook with my king (it would be illegal)\n- I can't block the check with any piece except my knight\n- Moving my knight to f8 blocks the check from the rook\n\nSince I have only one legal move, I'll play it:\n\n```\nNf8\n```"
