If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

Material is roughly equal.\n- King safety: White's king is on h1, somewhat exposed. Black's king is on g8 with some pawn protection.\n- Piece activity: White has a rook on g3 that's actively placed and a queen on b2 that controls the long diagonal.\n- Threats: I notice immediate tactical opportunities with the rook on g3 targeting Black's g6 pawn.\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n1. **Rxg6+**: This is a direct attack that forces hxg6 (if fxg6, then Qg7#). After hxg6, White can follow with Qg7#. This is a forced mate sequence.\n\n2. **Qh8+**: Forces Kf8, but doesn't lead to an immediate win.\n\n3. **Qg7+**: Forces Rxg7, and after that White doesn't have a clear advantage.\n\n4. **Rxc5**: Captures a queen, but after Rxc5, White loses material.\n\nThe move Rxg6+ stands out as it leads to a forced checkmate:\n1. Rxg6+ hxg6 (forced)\n2. Qg7# (checkmate)\n\nThis is a clear winning sequence for White.\n\n```\nRxg6+\n```"
