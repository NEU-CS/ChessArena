Let me break down what I see:\n\nPosition analysis:\n- I'm playing as Black with my king on b4\n- White's king is on g5\n- I have pawns on a6 and b5\n- White has a pawn on h4\n- It's my move\n\nThis is a king and pawn endgame where both sides are trying to promote their pawns. Let me evaluate the key factors:\n\n1) Pawn race: My a-pawn needs 3 moves to promote (a5, a4, a3, a2, a1=Q), while White's h-pawn needs 4 moves (h5, h6, h7, h8=Q).\n\n2) King positions: White's king is far from my pawns, while my king can support my pawns' advance.\n\n3) Opposition and king activity: I need to consider how to best use my king.\n\nLet me evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n- Kc5: Moves away from supporting the a-pawn's advance\n- Ka5: Moves away from the center and limits king mobility\n- Kc4: Centralizes my king but doesn't directly help pawn advancement\n- Ka4: Doesn't improve my position significantly\n- Kc3: Moves toward the center but away from my pawns\n- Kb3: Moves toward the center while staying connected to my pawns\n- Ka3: Moves away from the center\n- a5: Advances my a-pawn, starting the promotion race\n\nThe key insight is that I have a winning pawn race if I push my a-pawn immediately. Since my a-pawn can promote faster than White's h-pawn, and White's king is too far away to stop it, I should start the race now.\n\n```\na5\n```"

Let me assess what's happening:\n\n1) Material: Equal with just kings and pawns\n2) Position: I'm playing as Black with king on b4 and pawns on a5 and b5\n3) White has king on g5 and pawn on h5\n4) It's my move (Black to play)\n\nThis is a race situation - both sides are trying to promote their pawns. Let me evaluate:\n\nWhite's plan is to push the h-pawn to h8 and promote. My plan should be to push my a and b pawns to promotion.\n\nDistance calculation:\n- White king is on g5, needs 3 moves to reach h8 (g6, g7, h8)\n- White h-pawn needs 3 moves to promote (h6, h7, h8)\n- My a-pawn needs 4 moves to promote (a4, a3, a2, a1)\n- My b-pawn needs 5 moves to promote (b4, b3, b2, b1)\n\nI need to calculate which pawn to push and whether I can outrace White's pawn.\n\nIf I play a4, pushing my a-pawn:\n1. a4, White plays h6\n2. a3, White plays h7\n3. a2, White plays h8=Q\nWhite promotes first and I lose.\n\nLet me check if I can use my king to stop White's pawn:\n- From b4, my king would need 6 moves to reach h7 (c5, d5, e5, f5, g6, h7)\n- That's too slow to stop White's promotion\n\nMy best chance is to race with my pawns and try to promote with check or create counterplay.\n\nThe move a4 starts advancing my fastest pawn immediately, which gives me the best practical chances in this race.\n\n```\na4\n```"
