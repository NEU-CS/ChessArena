When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Let me understand what's happening on the board.\n\nLooking at the FEN notation:\n- I'm playing as Black\n- White has just captured something with the queen on e8, putting my king in check\n- My king is on g8, and White's queen is on e8 delivering check\n- I have only one legal move: Rxe8 (capturing White's queen with my rook)\n\nLet me assess the position:\n1. Material count:\n   - White has a queen, rook, two bishops, and pawns\n   - I have a rook, queen, bishop, knight, and pawns\n   - After Rxe8, I'll capture White's queen with my rook, which is a good material gain\n\n2. Position analysis:\n   - I'm in check and must respond\n   - Capturing the queen is my only legal move\n   - After capturing, I'll be up in material significantly\n\nSince I have only one legal move, and it happens to be a good one (capturing the opponent's queen), the decision is straightforward.\n\n```\nRxe8\n```"
