If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

Material is roughly equal.\n2. King safety: My king is on g8, somewhat exposed with the White rook on b8 threatening the back rank.\n3. Piece activity: My queen is active on a4, knight on d3 is well-placed, and rook on f7 is defending the 7th rank.\n4. Threats: White's rook on b8 is threatening a back-rank checkmate if I move my rook away from f7.\n\nI have only two legal moves: Rf8 or Qe8. Let me analyze each:\n\n**Rf8:**\n- This defends against the back-rank checkmate threat\n- But it blocks my king's escape square\n- My rook would be pinned to the king by the enemy rook on b8\n- This seems very passive and allows White to increase pressure\n\n**Qe8:**\n- This also defends against the back-rank checkmate threat\n- Keeps my queen active\n- Maintains control of the a-file\n- Doesn't block my king's potential escape squares\n- My knight on d3 remains a strong outpost threatening White's position\n\nQe8 is clearly superior as it addresses the immediate threat while maintaining piece activity and not restricting my king's mobility. The queen can continue to be active from e8, whereas the rook would be pinned and passive on f8.\n\n```\nQe8\n```"
