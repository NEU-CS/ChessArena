        "content": "I'll analyze this position step by step to find the best move for White.\n\nFirst, let me assess the position:\n- Material is equal (rook + rook + king vs rook + rook + king)\n- White has a pawn structure on e3, e5, f3, f4, c3, h2\n- Black has pawns on a7, c6, c7, f7, g7, h7\n- White's king is still on e1 with castling rights, while Black's king is on g8\n- Black's rooks are doubled on the b-file (rb8 and rb8)\n\nKey considerations:\n1. White can castle kingside (O-O is available)\n2. White's rook on a1 could potentially attack Black's a7 pawn\n3. White's pawn structure is solid but needs development\n\nLooking at candidate moves:\n- O-O would develop the king to safety\n- Rxa7 would win a pawn immediately\n- Advancing pawns like e6 could create threats\n\nAnalyzing Rxa7: This captures a pawn immediately, but after Black plays Rxa7, White loses a rook for a pawn. This is clearly bad.\n\nAnalyzing O-O: This completes development by castling the king to safety. After castling, White can consider attacking on the kingside or using the a-file rook more effectively.\n\nAnalyzing e6: This pushes the pawn forward but might be premature without securing the king first.\n\nAfter careful consideration, castling kingside (O-O) appears to be the best move. It secures the king, connects the rooks, and prepares for further action. White should complete development before launching attacks.\n\n```\nO-O\n```"
