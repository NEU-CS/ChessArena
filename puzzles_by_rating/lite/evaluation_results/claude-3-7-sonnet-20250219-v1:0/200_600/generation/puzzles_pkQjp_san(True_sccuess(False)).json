When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Let me assess the situation:\n\nCurrent material:\n- Black: Rook + 4 pawns\n- White: Rook + Queen + 4 pawns\n\nWhite has a significant material advantage with the queen. I'm clearly at a disadvantage.\n\nKey observations:\n1. My king is on h8, potentially vulnerable\n2. White's queen on e6 and rook on d7 are threatening me\n3. White's king is on h3, relatively safe\n\nLet me check for immediate threats:\n- White's queen on e6 threatens my rook on e8\n- White's rook on d7 could move to d8 or h7, creating mating threats\n- White's queen and rook are coordinating for a potential mate\n\nLooking at my options:\n- Rg8/Rf8/etc: Moving my rook along the 8th rank doesn't solve the immediate threats\n- Re7: Trades my rook for White's rook, but leaves me defenseless against the queen\n- Rxe6: Captures the queen but loses my rook to Rd8+ followed by mate\n- h5: Doesn't address immediate threats\n- a5/c4: Pawn moves that don't help my defensive needs\n\nThe position looks lost for Black. My best chance is to try to create some counterplay or at least make it harder for White to execute the mate.\n\nAmong my options, Rg8 seems best as it defends the g7 pawn and keeps the rook active on the g-file, potentially creating some counterplay if White makes a mistake.\n\n```\nRg8\n```"
