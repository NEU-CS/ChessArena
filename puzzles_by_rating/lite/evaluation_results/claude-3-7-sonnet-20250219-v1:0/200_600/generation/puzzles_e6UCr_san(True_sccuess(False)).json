If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Kc6: This move supports the pawn and prevents the black king from approaching it. After Kc6, Black's king is cut off and White can promote the pawn.\n\n2. Kc5: This move doesn't make progress toward supporting the pawn's promotion.\n\n3. Ka5: This blocks the pawn's advancement and doesn't make progress.\n\n4. Kc4: This moves away from the pawn, allowing Black's king to potentially capture it.\n\n5. Kb4: This moves away from the pawn, allowing Black's king to potentially capture it.\n\n6. Ka4: This moves away from the pawn, allowing Black's king to potentially capture it.\n\nThe best move is clearly Kc6, which supports the pawn's promotion while keeping the black king at bay. After Kc6, if Black plays Kb8, White can play a7+ followed by a8=Q.\n\n```\nKc6\n```"
