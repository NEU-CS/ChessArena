When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and rook vs Black's bishop and rook. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's knight on e5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4 that could be dangerous\n- White's rook on h5 is pinning the f6 pawn to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h8: Rook lift, but allows Black to play ...e3 attacking the rook\n- e5f7: Knight check, but Black can block with ...Rf7\n- e5g6: Knight move attacking the f8 rook\n- e1e4: Capturing the dangerous passed pawn\n- c4c5: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1e4:\n- Eliminates Black's dangerous passed pawn\n- If Black takes back ...Nxe4, White can play Nf7+ winning the rook\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Rxe4 winning material\n- Maintains all of White's active piece threats\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or allow Black to maintain counterplay. Capturing the pawn is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\ne1e4\n```"
