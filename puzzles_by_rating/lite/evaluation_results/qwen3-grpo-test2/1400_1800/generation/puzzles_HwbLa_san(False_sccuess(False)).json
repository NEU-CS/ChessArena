When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and rook vs White's queen and rook. Material is roughly equal, but White's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on h6\n- Black's rook on b1 is inactive\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h7: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n- g6h7: Blocks queen's diagonal but leaves king exposed\n- f6d4: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n- b1b3: Activates the rook and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6d4:\n- Eliminates White's dangerous passed pawn\n- After Qxd4, Black can play Rb3 attacking the queen\n- If White doesn't take, Black removes a key pawn\n- Other moves either don't address the passed pawn or leave the king exposed\n\nThe move f6d4 solves the most pressing problem in the position (the passed pawn) while maintaining piece activity. It's the most forcing and practical choice.\n\n```\nf6d4\n```"
