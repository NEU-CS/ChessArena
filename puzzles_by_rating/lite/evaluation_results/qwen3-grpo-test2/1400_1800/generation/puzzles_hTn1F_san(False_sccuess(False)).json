When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a bishop on g5 controlling important squares\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's queen on c6 is very active\n- White's king is slightly exposed\n- Black has a rook on c8 eyeing the c-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3h5: Attacks the bishop but allows ...Bxh5\n- d3c5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n- d2a5: Pins the pawn on b6 to the queen\n- c2c6: Captures the queen but allows ...bxc6 opening lines\n\n4. Best move seems to be d3c5:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the active queen on c6\n- If queen moves, we can play d2a5 pinning the b6 pawn\n- If Black plays ...Qb7, we can consider Bf4 increasing pressure\n- Maintains control of key squares\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow Black to maintain initiative. d3c5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nd3c5\n```"
