When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Black is up material but White has some compensation with the active queen.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's queen on b8 is very active\n- Black's rook on d5 is centralized but could be vulnerable\n- White has a passed pawn on f4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7f7: Moves king to safer square but blocks queen's defense of f6\n- c6e8: Queen moves to defend king but allows Qb8e5+ winning the rook\n- d5d8: Rook retreats but seems passive\n- d5h5: Rook checks the king, but Qb8h8 wins the rook\n- c4c3: Advances passed pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be g7f6:\n- Gets the king to safer square\n- Covers e5 square against Qb8e5+ ideas\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the king safety. g7f6 is the most solid move that maintains Black's material advantage while reducing White's attacking chances.\n\n```\ng7f6\n```"
