When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on d4\n- White's rook on d7 is under attack by Black's rook on b5\n- White's bishop on b3 is pinned to the queen by Black's queen\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7d8: Moves the rook but doesn't solve the pin\n- a3e7: Attacks the black king and un-pins the bishop\n- b3d5: Moves the bishop but doesn't address immediate threats\n- h1h2: Seems passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be a3e7 because:\n- It attacks the black king, forcing it to move\n- Un-pins the bishop on b3\n- After Kf8 (only legal move), White can play Bd5 winning the queen\n- Even if Black doesn't take the rook, White gains time to reorganize\n\nOther moves either don't address the pin or don't create threats. a3e7 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\na3e7\n```"
