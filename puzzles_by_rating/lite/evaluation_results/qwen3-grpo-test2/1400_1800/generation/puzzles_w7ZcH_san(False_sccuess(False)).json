When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, bishop, rook and pawns vs Black's queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on b7 is very active\n- Black's queen on g6 is exposed\n- Black's knight on f5 is well placed but could be challenged\n- White's bishop on f3 is controlling important squares\n- Black's bishop on d6 is blocked by its own pawn on c7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7c8: Queen takes rook, but Black can play Qxc8\n- b7d5: Centralizing the queen, attacking the knight\n- f3c6: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Qxc6\n- c1h6: Bishop move attacking the queen\n- a1b1: Rook move preparing to double on the b-file\n\n4. Best move seems to be b7d5:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the knight on f5\n- If Black moves the knight, White can play Qxg6 winning the queen\n- If Black plays Qxd5, then Bxd5 and White is up a piece\n- If Black plays anything else, White can continue attacking\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position as much or allow Black to consolidate. b7d5 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\nb7d5\n```"
