When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is very active on f4\n- White's king is on b4, somewhat exposed\n- Black has a passed pawn on h2 that's close to promotion\n- White has a passed pawn on d6 that's also close to promotion\n- Black's rook on h1 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6f8: Rook moves to 8th rank, but doesn't accomplish much\n- f6f7: Rook moves forward, but Black can play ...h1h2\n- b4c5: King moves towards center, but exposes to checks\n- d6d7: Pushes passed pawn, but Black can play ...h1h2\n- c4c5: Pushes pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be b4c5:\n- Gets the king to safer square\n- Prepares to support the d-pawn's advance\n- If Black plays ...h1h2, White can play d6d7 and the king can help stop the h-pawn\n- If Black checks with ...h1c1+, White can play Kd4 and the position is still holdable\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawns or leave the king exposed. b4c5 is the most flexible and safe move.\n\n```\nb4c5\n```"
