When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong bishop on h6 controlling the long diagonal\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's knight on g4 is very active\n- Black has a knight on c2 that's not doing much\n- White's queen on f3 is eyeing the f7 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8e7: Centralizing the queen and defending f7\n- f5e4: Attacking the strong h6 bishop\n- c2e3: Moving the inactive knight to a more active square\n- g8h8: Moving the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be f5e4:\n- It attacks the strong h6 bishop\n- If White takes the knight (Bxe4), Black can play Qd6 attacking the queen\n- If White moves the bishop, Black gains time to improve position\n- It's more active than moving the queen or king\n- It prevents White from playing Qf5, which would be very strong\n\nOther moves like d8e7 are defensive and don't improve Black's position. c2e3 is okay but doesn't address the immediate threats. g8h8 is too passive.\n\n```\nf5e4\n```"
