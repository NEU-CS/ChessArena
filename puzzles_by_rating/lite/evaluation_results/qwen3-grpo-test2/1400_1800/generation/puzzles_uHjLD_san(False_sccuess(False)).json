When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops and pawns. Black has a queen, rook, knight, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen on b5 is very active\n- Black has a bishop on h2 attacking White's king\n- Black's knight on g4 is threatening to fork with Nf2+\n- White has a knight on d4 controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5b7: Queen takes rook, but Black can play Qxb7\n- d4e6: Centralizing the knight, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- a3c4: Developing the bishop, but slow\n- b2c3: Blocking the bishop's diagonal\n\n4. The most critical issue is Black's threat of Nf2+ winning the rook on f1. The best way to prevent this is:\n- b2c3 blocks the bishop's diagonal and prevents Nf2+\n- After b2c3, if Black plays Nf2, we can play Bxf2 winning the knight\n\nOther moves either don't address the threat or allow Black to maintain the initiative. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb2c3\n```"
