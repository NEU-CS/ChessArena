When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, knight and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook and bishop.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on d4\n- Black's rook on g4 is very active\n- Black's queen on f3 is threatening\n- White's queen on c3 is defending but can be harassed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4g2: Rook checks the king, but White can block with Qe2\n- f3e2: Queen checks the king, but White can take the rook\n- d6e5: Bishop moves to attack the queen\n- f3f4: Queen moves to attack the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be f3f4:\n- It's a direct attack on the exposed king\n- If White takes the rook (Qxf4), then Bg3+ wins the queen\n- If White moves the king, Black can follow up with Rg2+ or Qe3+\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while increasing pressure\n\nOther moves either don't attack the king or allow White to consolidate. f3f4 is the most forcing and dangerous move.\n\n```\nf3f4\n```"
