When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on f7 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on c6\n- Black's queen on e5 is under attack by the knight on e7\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- c6d7: Moves king away from center but still leaves queen hanging\n- c6c7: Similar to d7, doesn't solve queen issue\n- c6b7: Moves king towards corner, not ideal\n- c6d6: Moves king towards center but still leaves queen hanging\n- c6b6: Moves king towards pawn, but queen still hangs\n- c6b5: Moves king forward, but queen still hangs\n- e5e7: Captures the knight, but allows Qxe7 winning the queen\n\nThe best move is e5e7, capturing the knight. While it allows Qxe7, this is forced as all king moves leave the queen hanging. After Qxe7, Black can play Qxe7 and the position is more balanced. The alternative is to lose the queen for nothing.\n\n```\ne5e7\n```"
