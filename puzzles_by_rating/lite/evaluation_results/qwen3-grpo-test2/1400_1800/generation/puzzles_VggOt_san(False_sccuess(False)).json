When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. White is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and bishop.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g5 is very active\n- White's queen on f7 is also active but potentially trapped\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black has a bishop on c6 controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: Queen checks the king, but Black can block with ...Qg7\n- d6f8: Bishop checks the king, but Black can take the queen with ...Qxf8\n- e5e6: Advances the passed pawn, but doesn't address the queen situation\n- f7e7: Moves the queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n\n4. Best move seems to be f7e7 because:\n- Gets the queen to safety\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n- Keeps options open for future attacks\n- Doesn't allow Black to capture the queen\n- The queen is still very active from e7\n\nOther moves either allow Black to capture the queen or don't improve White's position as much. The passed pawn advance e5e6 is tempting but doesn't address the immediate queen situation.\n\n```\nf7e7\n```"
