When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on e5\n- Black's queen on a3 is very active but potentially exposed\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- White's queen on c7 is very active\n- Black's bishop on g7 is blocked by its own pawn on g6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a3d6: Centralizes the queen and attacks the e5 pawn\n- a3c5: Attacks the e5 pawn from another angle\n- a3b4: Pins the pawn on a2 to the rook on b5\n- g7f6: Opens the bishop's diagonal and challenges e5 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be a3d6 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the dangerous e5 pawn\n- If White takes the queen (Qxd6), Black can recapture with Bxd6, removing White's active queen\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with Qxe5, eliminating the passed pawn\n- It maintains pressure while keeping the queen safe\n\nOther moves either don't address the e5 pawn or leave the queen exposed. a3d6 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\na3d6\n```"
