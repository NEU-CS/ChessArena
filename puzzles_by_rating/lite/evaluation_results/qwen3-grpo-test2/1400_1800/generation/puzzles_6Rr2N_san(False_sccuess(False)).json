When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on c5\n- White's rook on f6 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on g3 that could be dangerous\n- White's bishop on d3 is blocked by its own pawn on c3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6f8: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- f6f7: Rook moves towards black king\n- d3e4: Bishop moves to open diagonal\n- d3e2: Bishop blocks the g3 pawn\n- h3h4: Stops black's g3 pawn from advancing\n\n4. Critical threats:\n- Black's g3 pawn is dangerous and needs to be stopped\n- Black could play ...g2 next move if not addressed\n\nAfter considering these factors, d3e2 seems most important as it:\n- Blocks the dangerous g3 pawn\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't lose tempo\n- Keeps all other options open\n\nThe move d3e2 prevents any immediate progress from Black's passed pawn while maintaining White's active piece play.\n\n```\nd3e2\n```"
