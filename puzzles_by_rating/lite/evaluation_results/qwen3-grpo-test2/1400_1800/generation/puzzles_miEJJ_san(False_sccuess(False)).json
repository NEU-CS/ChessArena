When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on b2 that could be dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's bishop on h4 is very active\n- Black's rook on e4 is under attack by White's queen on e3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4b7: Moving the rook to safety while attacking the b2 pawn\n- e4g6: Moving the rook to a more active square\n- d4d5: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n- g7g6: Moving the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4b7 because:\n- It saves the rook from capture\n- It attacks the dangerous b2 pawn\n- It maintains control of the e-file\n- It doesn't allow any immediate counterplay from White\n- After e4b7, if White takes the rook (Qxe4), Black can play Qb8 attacking the h4 bishop\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat to the rook or don't improve Black's position as much.\n\n```\ne4b7\n```"
