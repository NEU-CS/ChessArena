When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on e5 is very active\n- Black's bishop on f3 is pinned to the king by White's rook on c2\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7e6: Centralizing the queen and attacking the d5 pawn\n- f3g4: Moving the pinned bishop to safety while attacking h3\n- c4b3: Advancing the passed pawn\n- d7f5: Centralizing the queen and attacking e4\n\n4. Best move seems to be d7e6 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the dangerous d5 pawn\n- If White takes the queen (Qxe6), Black can play Bg4 winning the h3 pawn\n- If White moves the queen, Black can play Qe5 attacking the queen again\n- It maintains control of key squares\n\nOther moves have drawbacks:\n- f3g4 allows White to play Qe6 attacking the bishop\n- c4b3 allows White to play Qe6 attacking the pawn\n- d7f5 doesn't address the d5 pawn threat\n\n```\nd7e6\n```"
