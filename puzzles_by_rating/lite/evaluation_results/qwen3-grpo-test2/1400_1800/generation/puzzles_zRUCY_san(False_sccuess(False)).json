When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is up material but White has some counterplay with passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is on e6, Black's king on g6\n- Black has a bishop on g2 controlling important squares\n- Black has a passed pawn on c2 that can promote\n- White has passed pawns on d4 and h4\n- Black's g4 pawn is threatening to advance\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c2c1q: Promotes the pawn to a queen immediately. But White can play Kd5 attacking the bishop.\n- g2e4: Centralizes the bishop and controls more squares\n- g2d5: Puts bishop on a strong diagonal but allows Kd5\n- g6h7: Moves king away from potential checks but seems passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be c2c1q:\n- Promotes the pawn to a queen immediately\n- After Kd5, Black can play Bg2e4 controlling key squares\n- White's pawns are not fast enough to promote before Black can use the new queen\n- Even if White tries h5, Black can handle it with the queen and bishop\n\nThe immediate promotion is the most forcing and decisive move, creating a winning advantage.\n\n```\nc2c1q\n```"
