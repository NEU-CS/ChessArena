When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Black is down a queen for a rook, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on c5\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- White's queen is very active on a4\n- Black's knight on g4 is under attack by White's bishop on f3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the rook out of potential pins but doesn't address the knight threat\n- e7h4: Moves the bishop to defend the knight but blocks the rook\n- g4h6: Moves the knight to safety while maintaining pressure\n- e8g8: Castles to safety but leaves the knight hanging\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4h6:\n- Saves the knight from capture\n- Moves it to a safe square where it can't be captured by bishop or pawn\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- After this, Black can think about defending against White's passed pawn\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threat to the knight. g4h6 is the most practical choice in this difficult position.\n\n```\ng4h6\n```"
