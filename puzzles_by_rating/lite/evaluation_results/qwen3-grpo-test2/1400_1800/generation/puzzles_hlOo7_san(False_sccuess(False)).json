When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on h4\n- Black's bishop on e5 is strong, controlling important squares\n- Black has a passed pawn on d3 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5c7: Bishop takes rook, but after Qxc7 Black's d3 pawn is blockaded\n- e5f4: Bishop checks the king, but White can just take the bishop\n- d3c2: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n- e8f8: Moving the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5c7:\n- It wins the exchange (bishop for rook)\n- After Qxc7, Black can play d3c2 creating a passed pawn\n- White's queen will be tied down to stopping the pawn\n- Black's bishop was already very active and can continue to harass White's position\n\nThe immediate material gain is most important here, as it equalizes the material deficit and creates concrete threats.\n\n```\ne5c7\n```"
