When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, pawn and a rook. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on a2 that's close to promotion\n- White's knight on c6 is very active\n- Black's rook on c8 is controlling the c-file\n- White's bishop on b3 is blocked by its own pawn on d3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6d8: Captures the rook but allows a2a1=Q\n- c6e7: Attacks the g6 pawn but doesn't address the a-pawn\n- d3d4: Opens the bishop's diagonal but allows a2a1=Q\n- b3c4: Moves the bishop but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c3c4: Stops the a-pawn but is passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6d8:\n- It wins the exchange (knight for rook)\n- After a2a1=Q, White can play d3d4 attacking the new queen\n- Black's king is exposed and White has active pieces\n- Even if Black promotes, White gets compensation with the active pieces\n\nThe immediate material gain is most important here, as the a-pawn is not yet promoted and can be stopped later.\n\n```\nc6d8\n```"
