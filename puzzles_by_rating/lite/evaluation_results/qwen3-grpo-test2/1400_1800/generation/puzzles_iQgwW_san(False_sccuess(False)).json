When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White's king is also uncastled\n- Black's knight on f5 is very active\n- White's queen on d3 is eyeing the d5 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8 (castling) - gets the king to safety but may be too passive\n- e7g5 - attacks the f3 knight and opens the bishop's diagonal\n- f5h4 - threatens to win the h3 pawn\n- d8a5 - attacks the c5 passed pawn\n- e8g8 (castling) - similar to h8g8 but with the other rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7g5:\n- Attacks the f3 knight which is defending h4\n- Opens the diagonal for the dark-squared bishop\n- If White takes the knight (fxg5), Black can play Qa5 attacking the c5 pawn\n- If White moves the knight, Black can play Qa5 with tempo\n- Maintains pressure while developing the bishop\n\nOther moves either don't address the position's needs or are too passive. e7g5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\ne7g5\n```"
