When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and rook vs Black's bishop and rook. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's rook on g3 is very active\n- Black's bishop on f5 is strong, controlling important squares\n- White's bishop on b3 is blocked by pawns\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3g7: Rook check, but Black can block with Rg7\n- b3e6: Bishop move attacking the a5 pawn, but Black can defend\n- d4d5: Pushing the pawn to open lines, but Black can capture\n- e2f4: Centralizing the knight and attacking f5 bishop\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2f4:\n- Attacks the strong f5 bishop\n- If Black takes (Bxf4), White can play Rg7+ winning the exchange\n- If Black moves the bishop, White gains central control\n- Prepares to double rooks on the g-file\n- Maintains all other options\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish as much or allow Black to consolidate. e2f4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\ne2f4\n```"
