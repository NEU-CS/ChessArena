When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and bishop.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on f7 is very active\n- Black's queen on h4 is threatening\n- Black's bishop on b5 is controlling important squares\n- White's king is exposed on h2\n- Black's rook on g8 is semi-trapped\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4d8: Queen checks the king, but White can just move the king\n- h4f2: Queen checks the king, but White can take the queen with the rook\n- b5e2: Bishop checks the king, but White can take the bishop\n- h4h3: Threatens to win the h3 pawn\n- g8g2: Rook move to attack the pawn on g2\n\n4. Best move seems to be h4h3:\n- Threatens to win the h3 pawn\n- If White takes the queen (Rxh3), then Black can play Bg4+ winning the rook\n- If White doesn't take, Black can keep harassing the white king\n- Maintains pressure while keeping all pieces active\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow White to consolidate. h4h3 is the most forcing move.\n\n```\nh4h3\n```"
