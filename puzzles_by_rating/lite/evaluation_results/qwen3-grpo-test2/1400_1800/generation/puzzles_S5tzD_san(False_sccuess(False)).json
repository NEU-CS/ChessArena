When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook, pawns. Black is up a bishop but White has some compensation with the active queen and rook.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- White's queen on c8 is very active\n- Black's rook on d5 is centralized but could be vulnerable\n- White has a passed pawn on g4 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g6h7: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- d5d8: Trades the active rook but leaves Black's king exposed\n- b4c3: Attacks the g4 pawn while developing the bishop\n- a4e8: Centralizes the queen but doesn't address immediate concerns\n\n4. Best move seems to be b4c3 because:\n- It attacks the dangerous g4 pawn\n- If White takes (Qxc3), Black can play Rxd8 winning the exchange\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with Qe8+ or other moves\n- It develops the bishop to a more active square\n- It maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or are too passive. b4c3 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nb4c3\n```"
