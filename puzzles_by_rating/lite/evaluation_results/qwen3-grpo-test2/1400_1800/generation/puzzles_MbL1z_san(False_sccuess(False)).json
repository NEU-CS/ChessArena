When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on b2 that's very dangerous\n- White's king is exposed and needs to find safety\n- Black's rook on e8 is very active\n- White's rook on a1 is blocked by its own pawn on a2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h1g1: Gets the king to relative safety but doesn't address the b2 pawn\n- a1e1: Centralizes the rook but leaves the king exposed\n- a2a3: Stops the b2 pawn but weakens the pawn structure\n- d4d5: Advances the pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be a2a3:\n- Stops the dangerous passed pawn on b2\n- After b2b1Q, White can play a3b2 capturing the queen\n- Maintains pawn structure integrity\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the b2 pawn or create new problems. a2a3 is the most forcing and solves the most urgent problem.\n\n```\na2a3\n```"
