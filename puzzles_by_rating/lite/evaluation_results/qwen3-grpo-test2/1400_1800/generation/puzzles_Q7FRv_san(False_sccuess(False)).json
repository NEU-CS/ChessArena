When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Black is down a queen for a rook, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen is very active on g3\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on a3 that could become dangerous\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Moves the king to safety but seems passive\n- f6d4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the bishop on d3\n- e6f5: Moves the bishop to a more active diagonal\n- c6e5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6d4 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the bishop on d3\n- If White takes the knight (Bxd4), Black can play Qxd4 winning the bishop\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play Qxd3 winning material\n- It's the most active move in a position where Black needs to be active\n\nThe move f6d4 puts maximum pressure on White's position while improving Black's piece activity.\n\n```\nf6d4\n```"
