When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n- Black's knight on d5 is very active\n- White's queen on d3 is eyeing the d5 knight\n- Black's bishop on e7 is blocked by its own pawn on f7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5c7: Centralizing the knight and attacking the bishop on b7\n- d5f4: Attacking the queen and threatening to jump to e2\n- e7f6: Developing the bishop and protecting the king\n- g7g6: Adding a luft for the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5f4:\n- It attacks the queen directly\n- If queen moves, Black can play e7f6 developing the bishop\n- If White takes the knight (Qxf4), Black can play e7f6 and White's queen is exposed\n- It maintains Black's active piece play\n- It prevents White from playing Qd3-e4, which would be dangerous\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or don't improve Black's position as much. d5f4 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nd5f4\n```"
