When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's rook and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's rook is very active on g1, threatening to check from g4\n- White's rook on b4 is controlling the b-file\n- Black's king is on g6, White's king on h4\n- Pawn structure is mostly intact but White has an passed a-pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b4b8: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- b4b7: Similar to b8, not improving position\n- b4b6: Attacks the g6 king, but Black can just move away\n- b4d4: Centralizes rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n- b4c4: Puts rook on open file, but doesn't help much\n- b4b3: Prepares to push a-pawn but slow\n- b4b2: Same as b3\n- b4b1: Retreating rook\n- e4e5: Pushes pawn but doesn't address rook threat\n- a4a5: Pushes passed pawn but slow\n- f3f4: Creates luft for king and prevents g4 check\n\n4. Best move is f3f4 because:\n- Creates immediate luft for the king\n- Prevents Black's rook from checking from g4\n- Maintains all other options\n- Doesn't weaken any squares\n- Keeps the position flexible for future play\n\nThe other moves either don't address the immediate threat or are too passive.\n\n```\nf3f4\n```"
