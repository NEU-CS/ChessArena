When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's rook on e5 is very active\n- Black's queen on d7 is somewhat exposed\n- White's bishop on g3 is pinning the f6 knight to the king\n- Black's king is on g8 with limited mobility\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5e6: Rook check, but Black can block with Qe7\n- f3f7: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Qxf7\n- f3h5: Bishop moves to attack the knight, but doesn't accomplish much\n- b3c5: Knight move attacking the d7 queen\n- e5h5: Rook moves to attack the h7 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be b3c5:\n- It attacks the black queen directly\n- If Black moves the queen, White can play Rxe6 winning a pawn\n- If Black takes the knight (Qxc5), then Bxf6 wins material as the pin remains\n- It maintains all of White's threats while developing the knight\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. b3c5 is the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\nb3c5\n```"
