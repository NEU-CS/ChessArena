When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White's queen on a8 is very active\n- Black has a bishop on b7 controlling the long diagonal\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has a knight on b5 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a8c6: Centralizes the queen and attacks the knight on b5\n- c1h6: Develops the bishop with a threat against f8\n- d4e5: Advances the passed pawn\n- b1a3: Moves the knight to a safer square\n\n4. Best move seems to be a8c6 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the knight on b5\n- If Black moves the knight, we can play c1h6 with tempo\n- If Black takes the queen (b5c6), we recapture with b1c3 developing a piece\n- It maintains pressure on Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't develop pieces or don't address the active queen placement. a8c6 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\na8c6\n```"
