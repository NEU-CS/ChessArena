When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black has a knight on b6 that's not very active\n- White's rook on d6 is very active\n- Black's queen on c7 is somewhat restricted\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n- e8e7: Centralizes the rook but blocks the queen\n- c7d6: Trades queens but gives up control of important squares\n- b6d5: Activates the knight and attacks the e5 pawn\n- c6c5: Pushes the pawn to challenge White's structure\n\n4. Best move seems to be b6d5 because:\n- Activates the inactive knight\n- Attacks the dangerous e5 pawn\n- If White takes the knight (Qxd5), Black can play Qxd5 and the position simplifies favorably\n- If White doesn't take, Black gains control of important squares\n- Maintains flexibility for other pieces\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or concede too much control.\n\n```\nb6d5\n```"
