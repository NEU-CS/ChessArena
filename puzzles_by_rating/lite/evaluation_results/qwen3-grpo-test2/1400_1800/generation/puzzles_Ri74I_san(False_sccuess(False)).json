When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has pawns on b5, g6, h5; White has pawns on b3, f4, g3, h3, a2.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is more active (d5 vs White's e3)\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5\n- White has a passed pawn on f4\n- Black's pawns are more advanced on the kingside\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3f3: Moves king towards center but doesn't address any threats\n- e3d3: Moves king towards black's passed pawn\n- f4e5: Captures black's pawn but allows ...d5e4\n- f4f5: Advances passed pawn but may be premature\n- h3h4: Prepares g3-g4 but slow\n- g3g4: Creates passed pawn but weakens light squares\n- a2a3/a4: Doesn't address immediate concerns\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3d3:\n- Targets Black's passed b-pawn\n- If Black pushes b4, White can play a2b3 stopping the pawn\n- If Black doesn't push, White can continue king activity\n- Maintains flexibility for other pawn moves\n\nThis move actively addresses Black's main asset (the passed pawn) while keeping all options open.\n\n```\ne3d3\n```"
