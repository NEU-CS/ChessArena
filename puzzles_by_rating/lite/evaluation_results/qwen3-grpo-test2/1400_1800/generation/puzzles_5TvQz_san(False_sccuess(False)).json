When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's king is on b3, Black's king on d1\n- White has pawns on a6 and h6, Black has a pawn on d3\n- Black's rook is very active on h4, White's rook on e6\n- Black's pawn on d3 is passed but blockaded by White's king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4h6: Captures the h6 pawn but allows White's rook to become active\n- h4h5: Moves rook to a more passive square\n- h4g4: Centralizes the rook but doesn't accomplish much\n- d3d2: Advances the passed pawn, but White can capture it with the king\n- d1d2: Moves king towards the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d3d2:\n- It advances the passed pawn which is Black's best chance\n- After Kxd2, Black can play Rh4-h2+ winning the a6 pawn\n- Even if White doesn't take, the pawn is dangerous\n- Other rook moves don't create immediate threats\n\nThe most forcing and best move is to advance the passed pawn:\n\n```\nd3d2\n```"
