When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- White has a strong queen on d4 controlling key squares\n- Black's e4 knight is under attack by White's bishop on g3\n- Black's f6 queen is very active but potentially loose\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4d6: Moves the knight to safety while attacking the queen\n- e4g5: Moves the knight to attack the bishop on g3\n- f6d8: Moves the queen to safety while connecting rooks\n- e8g8: Moves the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4d6 because:\n- It saves the knight from capture\n- It attacks White's queen, forcing it to move\n- After Qd4 moves, Black can play Qf6d8, connecting rooks and improving queen safety\n- It maintains Black's active piece play\n\nOther moves either don't address the knight threat or don't improve Black's position as much. The knight is Black's most active piece and should be preserved.\n\n```\ne4d6\n```"
