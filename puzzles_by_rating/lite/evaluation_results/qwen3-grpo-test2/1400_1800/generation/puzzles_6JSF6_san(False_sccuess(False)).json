When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook and bishop.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on e5 is very active\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning the f3 pawn\n- White's queen on c2 is exposed\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4e2: Capturing the pawn and threatening the queen\n- e5e2: Capturing the pawn and attacking the queen\n- g4f3: Capturing the pinned pawn\n- e5e4: Centralizing the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4e2:\n- It wins a pawn\n- It attacks the exposed queen\n- After Qc2e4, Black can play e5e4 winning another pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play e5e4 next move anyway\n\nOther moves like e5e2 are good but don't win material immediately. g4f3 is tempting but allows Qc2e4 with counterplay. The pawn capture g4e2 is most forcing and wins material.\n\n```\ng4e2\n```"
