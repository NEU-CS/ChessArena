When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. White is down material but has some compensation with the active rook on e4 and bishop on e3.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g6 is very active\n- Black's rook on d3 is threatening White's pawn on c2\n- White's rook on e4 is centralized but could be vulnerable\n- White's bishop on e3 is blocked by its own pawn on c4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4e5: Centralizes the rook but allows Black's queen to become more active\n- e3a7: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- c2a4: Pawn move that attacks Black's rook, but allows ...d3c2\n- e3d4: Bishop move that attacks the rook on d3\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3d4:\n- Attacks the threatening rook on d3\n- If Black takes the bishop (Qxd4), White can play Rxd3 winning the exchange\n- If Black moves the rook, White can play Bxd3 winning the pawn\n- Maintains pressure while solving the immediate threat\n\nOther moves either don't address the threat or are too passive. e3d4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\ne3d4\n```"
