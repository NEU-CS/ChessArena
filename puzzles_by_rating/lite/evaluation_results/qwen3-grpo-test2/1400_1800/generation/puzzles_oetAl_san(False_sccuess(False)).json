When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White's bishop on e3 is very active\n- Black's queen on d5 is centralized\n- White's king is slightly exposed on g1\n- Black's king is on g8 with some pawn cover\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3h6: Bishop check, but Black can simply take the bishop\n- e3c5: Capturing the passed pawn, but Black can play Qxc5\n- f3g5: Centralizing the knight and attacking the queen\n- f2e4: Centralizing the knight and attacking the queen\n- d3d4: Pushing the pawn to challenge Black's center\n\n4. Best move seems to be f3g5:\n- Attacks the black queen directly\n- If queen moves, we can play Bc5 winning the c5 pawn\n- If queen takes our knight (Qxg5), we can play Bc5+ winning the queen back\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Keeps all our pieces active\n\nOther moves either don't challenge Black's position or allow Black to consolidate. f3g5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nf3g5\n```"
