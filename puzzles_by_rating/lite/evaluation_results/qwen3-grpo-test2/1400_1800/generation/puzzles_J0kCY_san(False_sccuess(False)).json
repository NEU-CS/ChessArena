When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King positions:\n- White king is on g5\n- Black king is on c7\n- Black's king is more active and can potentially support pawn advances\n\n3. Key observations:\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4 that could be dangerous\n- White's h4 pawn is under attack by Black's g5 pawn\n- White's king is more active but needs to be careful about checks\n\n4. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g5h6: Captures the h6 pawn but leaves h4 pawn hanging\n- g5g6: Moves towards Black's pawns but doesn't address h4\n- g5f6: Centralizes king but doesn't help with h4\n- g5f4: Protects h4 pawn but moves away from Black's pawns\n- g2g3: Protects h4 but is passive\n- f2f3: Blocks c-pawn but weakens king position\n- g2g4: Creates a passed pawn but leaves h4 hanging\n- f2f4: Best move - blocks c-pawn, protects h4, and creates a passed f-pawn\n\n5. f2f4 is the most active move as it:\n- Blocks Black's dangerous c-pawn\n- Protects the h4 pawn\n- Creates a passed f-pawn\n- Maintains king activity\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n\n```\nf2f4\n```"
