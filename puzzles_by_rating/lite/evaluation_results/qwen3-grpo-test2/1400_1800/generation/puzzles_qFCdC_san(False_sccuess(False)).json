When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's knight on h4 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e7 is blocked by its own pawn on f6\n- White has potential threats against Black's king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- f8e8: Centralizes the rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c6e5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n- f6e5: Also captures the pawn but leaves the f6 square weak\n- c7e5: Bishop capture, but allows White to play Nf5 with tempo\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6e5:\n- Removes the dangerous passed pawn\n- Opens the c-file for Black's rook\n- After Nxe5, Black can play Bf6 attacking the knight\n- If White doesn't take, Black maintains pressure on e5\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or create weaknesses. c6e5 is the most active and solves the most pressing problem in the position.\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
