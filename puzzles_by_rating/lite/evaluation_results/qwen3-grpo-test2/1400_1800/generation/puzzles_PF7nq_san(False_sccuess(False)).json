When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and bishop vs White's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on d7\n- White has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a knight on d5 that's very active\n- White's rook on d3 is controlling the open file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7: Centralizes the knight and defends the king\n- d5f6: Attacks the f5 pawn and threatens to jump to e4\n- c4d6: Moves the knight to a more active square\n- c3d4: Captures the bishop, but after Rxd4 Black's king remains exposed\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5e7 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Defends the king from potential checks\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Doesn't allow White to capture the bishop with c3d4\n- Keeps options open for the knight to jump to f6 or g5 later\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or leave the king vulnerable. d5e7 is the most solid move that maintains Black's defensive structure while keeping pieces active.\n\n```\nd5e7\n```"
