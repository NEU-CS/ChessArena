When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's king is on g8, pawn on g7\n- Black's king is on b2, bishop on c8, pawns on a6 and b5\n- White's rook is on c1, controlling the c-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c8d7: Bishop moves towards center but doesn't accomplish much\n- c8e6: Bishop moves towards white king but could be trapped\n- b2b3: King moves towards center but exposes to checks\n- b2a3: King moves away from center but safer\n- a6a5: Pushes pawn but doesn't create threats\n- b5b4: Pushes pawn but allows white rook to become active\n\n4. Best move seems to be b2a3:\n- Gets the king to safer square away from checks\n- Prepares to bring king towards white pawns\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics from white\n- Maintains flexibility for bishop movement\n\nOther moves either don't improve position or create weaknesses. b2a3 is the most solid choice.\n\n```\nb2a3\n```"
