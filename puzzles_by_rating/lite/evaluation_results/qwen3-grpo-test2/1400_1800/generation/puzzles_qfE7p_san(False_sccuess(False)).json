When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and knight vs White's queen and knight. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop pair.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e6 is very active\n- Black's bishop on f4 is pinning the knight on f3\n- Black's bishop on h5 is eyeing the g4 square\n- White's king is exposed on b1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5g4: Captures the pawn and maintains the pin on f3\n- f4e3: Captures the knight, but allows Qxe3\n- a5c3: Attacks the queen, but Q moves away\n- h8g8: Gets the rook out of potential pins\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5g4:\n- Wins a pawn\n- Maintains the pin on f3\n- If White takes the bishop (Qxg4), then Bxf3 wins the knight\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with Bg3 or Bf2, keeping pressure\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow White to maintain their active queen. h5g4 is the most forcing and concrete way to gain an advantage.\n\n```\nh5g4\n```"
