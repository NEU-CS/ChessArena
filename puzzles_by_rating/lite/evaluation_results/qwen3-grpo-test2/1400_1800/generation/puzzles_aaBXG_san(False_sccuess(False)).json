When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen and pawns. Black is down a queen for a bishop, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on e5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- Black's rook on g6 is under attack by White's pawn on f4\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on f5\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- e8f8: Moves the king to safety but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- g6e6: Captures the bishop but allows Qxe6 winning the rook\n- b6e6: Moves the queen to defend the rook while maintaining material balance\n\n4. Best move is b6e6 because:\n- It defends the rook on g6\n- Maintains material balance (queen for bishop)\n- After Qxe6, Rxe6 and Black is still down a minor piece but the position is more manageable\n- Other moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats\n\nThe move b6e6 is the most practical choice in this difficult position.\n\n```\nb6e6\n```"
