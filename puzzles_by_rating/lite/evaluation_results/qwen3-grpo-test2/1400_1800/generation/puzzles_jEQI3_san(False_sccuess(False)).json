When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and queen. Black is up in material (queen vs knight), but White has some compensation with the active bishop on h5 and potential threats.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on f6 is very active\n- White's bishop on h5 is pinning the f7 pawn to the king\n- Black has a bishop on c5 controlling important squares\n- White's knight on d2 is blocked by pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5e8: Bishop takes rook, but Black can play Qxe8\n- h5f7: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Qxf7\n- e2e5: Centralizing the knight, attacking the bishop on c5\n- d2e4: Centralizing the knight, attacking the pawn on d5\n- g1g4: Bringing the rook into the attack\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2e5:\n- Attacks the bishop on c5\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can play h5f7 winning a pawn\n- If Black plays Bxe5, White can play h5f7 winning a pawn\n- If Black plays Qxe5, White can play h5f7 winning a pawn\n- Maintains the pin on f7\n\nOther moves either don't address the material deficit or don't create threats. e2e5 is the most active move that creates problems for Black while maintaining White's defensive resources.\n\n```\ne2e5\n```"
