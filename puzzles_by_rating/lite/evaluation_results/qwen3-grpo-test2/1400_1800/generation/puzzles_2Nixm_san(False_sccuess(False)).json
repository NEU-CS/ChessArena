When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on h8 is very active\n- White's queen on e2 is exposed\n- Black has a passed pawn on h4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on b6 that needs to be watched\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Centralizes the rook but doesn't accomplish much\n- g6g4: Attacks the e2 queen directly\n- f6d6: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the b6 pawn\n- h4h3: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g6g4:\n- Directly attacks the exposed queen\n- If queen moves, Black can play h4h3 advancing the passed pawn\n- If queen takes rook (Qxg4), Black can play h4h3 and the pawn is very dangerous\n- White has no good way to defend against both threats\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White to consolidate. g6g4 is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for White.\n\n```\ng6g4\n```"
