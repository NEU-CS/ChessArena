Key features:\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on d3 that could promote\n- White's king is exposed and needs to be careful about checks\n- Black's rook on e5 is very active\n- White's rook on a7 is passive but can become active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a7a8: Rook lift, but doesn't address the d3 pawn\n- f3g5: Knight moves to attack the e5 rook, but allows d2\n- f3e5: Captures the active rook, but after d2 White's king is in trouble\n- c3c4: Blocks the d3 pawn's advance, seems most logical\n\n4. After c3c4:\n- If Black takes: dxc4, then Kd4 wins the pawn\n- If Black pushes: d2, then Kd4 still stops it\n- If Black does nothing, White can play Kd4 next move\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or create new weaknesses. c3c4 is the most precise, stopping the passed pawn while maintaining material equality.\n\n```\nc3c4\n```"

Best move seems to be f3d2:\n- Eliminates the dangerous passed pawn\n- After ...exd2, White can play Kc3 attacking the rook\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Kc3 next move anyway\n- Maintains White's active piece play\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or are too passive.
