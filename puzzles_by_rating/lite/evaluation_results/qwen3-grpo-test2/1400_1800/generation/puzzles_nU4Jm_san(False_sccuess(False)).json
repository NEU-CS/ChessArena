When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, knight and pawns vs White's queen, knight and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on a2\n- Black's queen is very active on d1\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's knight on e4 is very strong\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f2: Checks the king and attacks the g1 pawn\n- d1d2: Checks the king and attacks the a2 pawn\n- c5d3: Captures the knight and opens lines\n- e4g3: Attacks the g3 pawn and threatens to jump to f1\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4f2:\n- It's a check that forces the king to move\n- After Kb1 (only legal move), Black can play Qd2+ winning the a2 pawn\n- Even if White tries Ka3, Black can play Qd3+ winning the b3 pawn\n- This sequence wins material while maintaining the initiative\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow White to consolidate. The check is most forcing and leads to immediate gains.\n\n```\ne4f2\n```"
