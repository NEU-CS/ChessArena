When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous\n- Black's knight on f6 is under attack by White's pawn on h3\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on d4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h8: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n- f6g5: Moves knight to safety while attacking h3 pawn\n- e6d8: Moves bishop to safety but blocks rook\n- d4c3: Captures White's pawn but opens lines for White's pieces\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6g5 because:\n- Saves the knight which is under attack\n- Attacks the h3 pawn which is unprotected\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n- Keeps options open for the bishop and rooks\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat to the knight or create new weaknesses. f6g5 is the most active and safe move.\n\n```\nf6g5\n```"
