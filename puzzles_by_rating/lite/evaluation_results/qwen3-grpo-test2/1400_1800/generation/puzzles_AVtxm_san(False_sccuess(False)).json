When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's bishop on c5 is very active\n- White's rook on d4 is centralized but could be vulnerable\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4d8: Rook lift to attack the black king, but Black can defend with ...Qd7\n- e2c4: Bishop takes the active bishop, but Black can play ...Qxc4\n- f3g5: Knight jump to attack f7, but Black can defend\n- d1d3: Centralizing the queen and protecting e5 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2c4:\n- Removes Black's active bishop\n- After ...Qxc4, White can play Rxc4 winning the bishop pair\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White gains time by removing the strong bishop\n- Maintains pressure on e5 pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address Black's active pieces or don't improve White's position as much. The bishop trade is very favorable for White.\n\n```\ne2c4\n```"
