When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's rook and knight. Material is roughly equal, but Black has a passed pawn on c5 that could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's knight on g4 is very active\n- White's knight on h7 is threatening to jump to f8 (discovered check)\n- Black's rook on c3 is pinning White's pawn on b3\n- White's queen on f2 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7f8: Discovered check, but Black can block with ...Bf8\n- h4g6: Attacks the g4 knight, but Black can play ...Nf6\n- f2f7: Attacks the f7 pawn, but Black can defend\n- a3a4: Pushes the pawn to break the pin, but slows down the a-pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be h7f8:\n- It's a discovered check that forces Black to react\n- After ...Bf8, White can play Qf7+ winning the f7 pawn\n- Even if Black finds another way to block, White maintains initiative\n- It's the most forcing move in the position\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. h7f8 is the most aggressive and winning move.\n\n```\nh7f8\n```"
