When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and bishop vs White's queen and bishop. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's bishop on f4 is very active\n- White's queen on e4 is exposed\n- Black's knight on d5 is centralized\n- White's king is still in the center\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4g3: Attacks the bishop on h2 and threatens to win material\n- d5e3: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n- f4e3: Trades the active bishop for White's bishop\n- d7e5: Centralizes the queen and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be f4g3:\n- It attacks the bishop on h2 which is protecting White's pawn on g2\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play d5e3 winning the queen\n- If White doesn't move the bishop, Black can play f4h2 winning the pawn\n- It maintains Black's active piece play while putting pressure on White\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White to consolidate. f4g3 is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for White.\n\n```\nf4g3\n```"
