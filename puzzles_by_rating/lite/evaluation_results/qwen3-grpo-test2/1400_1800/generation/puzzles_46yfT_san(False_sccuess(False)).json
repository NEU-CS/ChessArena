When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is down a queen for a rook, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on g4 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- White has a bishop on f7 controlling important squares\n- Black's queen on d6 is under attack by White's bishop on g5\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n- e8f8: Moves the king towards the corner, but still leaves it exposed to checks\n- e8d8: Moves the king towards the queenside, but might be safer as it gets away from the open e-file\n\n4. Threats to consider:\n- White could play Qg4e6+ winning the knight on f6\n- White could play Bg5e3 attacking the queen\n- White could play Bf7d5 winning the queen\n\nThe best move is e8d8 because:\n- It gets the king away from the open e-file\n- It prepares to connect the rooks\n- It avoids potential checks along the e-file\n- It's slightly safer than e8f8 which would keep the king more exposed\n\n```\ne8d8\n```"
