When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on e4\n- Black's queen on b5 is eyeing the weak f1 square\n- Black's bishop on c8 is blocked by pawns\n- White's bishop on g6 is very strong\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5f1: Queen check, but White can block with Qf1 or Rf1\n- b5e2: Queen attacks the rook on c1, but White can defend\n- b5d3: Queen centralizes and attacks the bishop on g6\n- c8g4: Develops the bishop and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be b5d3:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the strong bishop on g6\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play Qxg6 winning material\n- If White defends the bishop, Black gains time to activate the bishop\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish as much or allow White to maintain their strong position. b5d3 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nb5d3\n```"
