When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a rook on e8 and bishop on g7 controlling important squares\n- White's bishop on b5 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black has a knight on e3 threatening to fork with Nc4\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5e8: Capturing the rook, but after ...Bxe8 White's bishop is lost\n- b5d7: Moving the bishop to safety while maintaining pressure\n- c3d5: Centralizing the knight and attacking the e3 knight\n- d1d7: Moving the rook to defend the bishop\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3d5:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the dangerous e3 knight\n- If Black takes the bishop with ...Nxd5, White can play Bxe8 winning the rook\n- If Black moves the e3 knight, White can play Bxe8 winning material\n- It maintains control of key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or lose material. c3d5 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
