When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black's knight and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f5\n- White's knight on e5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n- White has a passed pawn on f4\n- Black's h-pawn is advanced but blockaded by White's h2 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f7: Attacks the h6 pawn but allows Black to play ...d3\n- e5d7: Centralizes the knight but doesn't create threats\n- e5g6: Checks the king, but Black can take the knight with ...Kxg6\n- e5c6: Attacks the d4 pawn but allows ...d3\n- e5g4: Checks the king and attacks the h6 pawn\n- e5c4: Attacks the d4 pawn directly\n- e5f3: Blocks the f4 pawn's advance\n- e5d3: Captures the d4 pawn but allows ...Kxe5\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5g4:\n- It's a check that forces the king to move\n- After Kxg4, White can play f4f5 creating a passed pawn\n- If the king moves away, White can capture h6 next move\n- It maintains pressure while keeping the knight active\n\nThe move e5g4 creates immediate threats and maintains White's initiative.\n\n```\ne5g4\n```"
