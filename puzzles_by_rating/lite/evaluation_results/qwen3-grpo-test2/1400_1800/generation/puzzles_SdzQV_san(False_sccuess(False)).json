When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's knight on f5 is very active\n- Black's queen on f6 is eyeing the f5 knight\n- White's bishop on e4 is blocked by its own pawn on d3\n- Black's bishop on a6 is very active\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5g7: Captures the bishop but allows Qxg7\n- f5e7: Centralizes the knight but doesn't achieve much\n- e4a8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- f3g4: Attacks the queen, but Qxg4 is possible\n- f5d6: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be f5d6:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the black queen\n- If queen moves, we can play Bxa6 winning a bishop\n- If queen takes knight (Qxd6), then Bxa6 wins a bishop\n- If queen moves to f5, we can play Qe2+ winning the pawn on g5\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow Black to maintain pressure. f5d6 is the most active and disruptive move.\n\n```\nf5d6\n```"
