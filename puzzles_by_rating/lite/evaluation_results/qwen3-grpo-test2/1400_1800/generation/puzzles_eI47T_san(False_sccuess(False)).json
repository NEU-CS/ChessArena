When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen on e8 is very active\n- Black has a rook on f2 attacking White's king\n- White has a knight on b6 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a knight on f4 that's threatening to jump to e2 or g2\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- h1g1: Moves the king to safety but doesn't address the threats\n- e8c6: Queen takes bishop, but after ...Rf2xg2 White's king is in trouble\n- e8e4: Queen moves to e4, attacking the knight on f4\n- b6d5: Knight moves to d5, centralizing but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d2e4: Knight takes pawn, but allows ...Rf2xg2\n- d2f3: Knight blocks the rook's path to g2\n- c1c6: Rook moves to c6, attacking the bishop\n\nThe best move is d2f3 because:\n1) It blocks the rook's path to g2, preventing immediate mate threats\n2) It maintains control of key squares\n3) It keeps all other options open\n4) It's the most solid move that addresses the most urgent threats\n\n```\nd2f3\n```"
