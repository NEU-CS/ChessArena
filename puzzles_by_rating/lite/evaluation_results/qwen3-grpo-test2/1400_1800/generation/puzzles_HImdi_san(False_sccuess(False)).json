When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, pawns vs White's rook, queen, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on b7\n- White has a knight on c4 that's very active\n- Black's queen on f7 is somewhat restricted\n- White's rook on h1 is not yet active\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h8: Rook moves to h8, but doesn't accomplish much\n- f7e6: Queen moves to e6, attacking the knight on c4\n- c4d6: Knight moves away from the active c4 square\n- e4e3: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be f7e6:\n- Attacks the active knight on c4\n- If White moves the knight, Black can play e4e3 pushing the passed pawn\n- If White takes the queen (Qxe6), Black can play d8d1+ winning the rook\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with e4e3\n\nOther moves either don't address the active knight or don't create threats. f7e6 is the most forcing move that improves Black's position.\n\n```\nf7e6\n```"
