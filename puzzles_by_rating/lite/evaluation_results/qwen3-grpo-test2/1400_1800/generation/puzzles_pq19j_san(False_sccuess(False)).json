When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- White has a rook on e5 controlling the e-file\n- Black has a bishop on d5 that's very active\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has a pawn on b4 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7: Bishop takes rook, but after Rxe7 Black's king remains exposed\n- d5f6: Bishop moves to a safe square while maintaining pressure\n- d6d7: Rook moves to defend the king\n- d4d3: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5e7:\n- It wins the exchange (bishop for rook)\n- After Rxe7, Black can play Kf7 bringing the king to safety\n- White's passed d-pawn isn't too dangerous as Black can stop it with the rook\n- Black's b-pawn can advance later\n\nOther moves either don't win material or leave the king exposed. d5e7 is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\nd5e7\n```"
