When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has a queen and pawns\n- Black has a rook, bishop and pawns\n- Material is roughly equal (queen vs rook+bishop)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's king is exposed on h6\n- Black's king is on e7\n- Black has a rook on d5 and another on d3\n- White has a queen on c7\n- Black has a passed pawn on b3\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e7f8: Moves king away from center but doesn't accomplish much\n- e7e8: Similar to f8, passive\n- e7f6: Moves king towards white's king, but exposes it to checks\n- d5d7: Most active, attacks the queen and opens lines\n\n4. Best move is d5d7 because:\n- It attacks the white queen directly\n- If queen moves, black can play d3d2 winning the f3 pawn\n- If queen takes rook (Qxd7), then b3b2 promotes the pawn\n- It maintains black's active piece play\n- It doesn't allow any counterplay for white\n\nThe move d5d7 is the most forcing and creates immediate threats while maintaining black's initiative.\n\n```\nd5d7\n```"
