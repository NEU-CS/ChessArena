When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop and pawns. Black is down a queen for a rook, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on b5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- Black has a rook on d2 that's trapped by its own pawn on d2\n- White has a passed pawn on g3 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8g8: Gets the king to safety but doesn't address other issues\n- d8d7: Blocks the queen's diagonal but leaves the rook trapped\n- c5c7: Attacks the rook on b7 but allows Qxc7\n- d2d5: tries to free the rook but allows Qxd5\n\n4. Best move seems to be d2d5:\n- It frees the trapped rook\n- If Qxd5, then Bxd5 and Black has some compensation\n- If White doesn't take, the rook becomes active\n- It's the most active move in a difficult position\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate problems or allow White to consolidate their advantage. d2d5 is the most dynamic choice that creates counterplay.\n\n```\nd2d5\n```"
