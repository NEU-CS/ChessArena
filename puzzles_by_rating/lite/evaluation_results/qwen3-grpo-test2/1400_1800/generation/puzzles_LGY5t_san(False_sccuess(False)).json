When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on f2, attacking White's king\n- White's queen on a5 is very active but potentially exposed\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n- White's king is exposed on b1\n- Black's rook on f8 is eyeing the f-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a5d8: Queen checks the king, but Black can block with ...Rf7\n- a5a8: Queen retreats but doesn't address the threats\n- h1h3: Moves the rook to defend g3 square\n- d1d2: Moves the rook to defend the second rank\n- a5b4: Attacks the d4 pawn while maintaining pressure\n\n4. Best move seems to be a5b4 because:\n- It attacks the dangerous d4 pawn\n- If Black takes the queen (Qxb4), White can play Rf2 winning the queen back\n- It maintains pressure on Black's position\n- It doesn't allow Black to consolidate with ...Rf7 or ...Qe3+\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or miss the opportunity to attack the d4 pawn. a5b4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\na5b4\n```"
