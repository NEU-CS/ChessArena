When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, pawns vs White's rook, knight, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on c7 that's very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's rook on d8 is blocked by the pawn on f5\n- White's rook on d1 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8f7: Gets the king to safety but blocks the f-file\n- d8d7: Challenges the knight but allows Nxe5\n- c6e4: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the e5 pawn\n- f5g4: Opens the f-file for the rook but weakens e4\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6e4:\n- Attacks the e5 pawn which is Black's main concern\n- If White takes the bishop (Nxe4), Black can play f5g4 winning the f3 pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play d8d7 next move to challenge the knight\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address the e5 pawn or create new weaknesses. c6e4 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nc6e4\n```"
