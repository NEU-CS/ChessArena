When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4 that's very dangerous\n- White's rook on e7 is active but could be vulnerable\n- Black's knight on d4 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e8: Rook retreat, but allows Black's e-pawn to advance\n- d5g8: Bishop moves to attack the e-pawn, but Black can defend\n- d5e6: Bishop blocks the e-pawn, but Black can play ...Nf3 attacking the bishop\n- g1h2: King moves away from potential checks, but seems passive\n- e4e5: Capturing the dangerous pawn, but Black can play ...Nf3 attacking the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4e5:\n- Eliminates the dangerous passed pawn\n- If Black plays ...Nf3, White can play Rxe4 winning the knight\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Bg8 attacking the e-pawn\n- Maintains control of key squares\n\nThe move e4e5 solves the most pressing problem in the position (the passed pawn) while maintaining material equality and keeping the initiative.\n\n```\ne4e5\n```"
