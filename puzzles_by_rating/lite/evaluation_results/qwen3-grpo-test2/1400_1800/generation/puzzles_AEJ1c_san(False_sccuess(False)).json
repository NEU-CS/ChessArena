When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White is up material (rook + bishop vs rook).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's king is active on g5\n- Black has a rook on h1 threatening White's pawns\n- White has a passed pawn on b7 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g5h6: King moves towards Black's king, but allows ...Qd8+ winning the b7 pawn\n- g5f4: King moves away from threats, but doesn't address the b7 pawn\n- b7e7: Captures the e7 pawn with the rook, maintaining material advantage\n\n4. Best move is b7e7 because:\n- It wins a pawn while maintaining material advantage\n- After Rxe7, Black can't play ...Qd8+ because the king is protected by the bishop\n- It keeps the king safe while advancing the passed pawn\n- It maintains all threats against Black's king\n\nThe other moves either lose material or don't improve White's position as much.\n\n```\nb7e7\n```"
