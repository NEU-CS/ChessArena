When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, knight, pawns and rook. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on a6 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e4 is strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's knight on d5 is centralized but could be vulnerable\n- White's knight on c6 is threatening to jump to d8 or e7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4h7: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- d5e7: Knight moves to defend against Qd8+ ideas\n- c7d6: Queen moves to defend the knight and control more squares\n- e4f3: Bishop attacks the rook on f2\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4f3:\n- Attacks the rook on f2, forcing White to respond\n- If White takes the bishop (Rxf3), Black can play Qd6+ winning the knight on c6\n- If White moves the rook, Black can play Qd6+ anyway, winning the knight\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Keeps all pieces active\n\nOther moves either don't address White's threats or are too passive. e4f3 is the most forcing and disruptive move.\n\n```\ne4f3\n```"
