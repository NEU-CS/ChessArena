When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on f2, attacking White's king\n- White's queen on h8 is trapped and will be captured next move\n- Black has a bishop on g4 controlling the long diagonal\n- White's king is exposed on d1\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- c4e2: Blocks the queen's attack on f2 but leaves the queen trapped\n- g1f3: Moves the king away from attack but allows Qxh8\n- g1e2: Moves the king towards the center but still allows Qxh8\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- All moves lose the queen on h8\n- g1f3 is the most active, moving the king towards safety while keeping some piece activity\n- c4e2 is passive and doesn't improve king safety\n- g1e2 leaves the king more exposed to checks\n\nThe best practical chance is g1f3, moving the king towards safety while maintaining some piece activity. The other moves either don't improve the position or leave the king more exposed.\n\n```\ng1f3\n```"
