When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has pawns on a3, b4, f5, g4, h5.\n\n2. King positions:\n- White king is on b2\n- Black king is on a4\nBlack's king is more active and closer to the action.\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n- White has passed pawns on f5 and h5\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5\n- The e5 pawn is blocked by White's f5 pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- b2c3: Moves king towards center but away from passed pawns\n- b2c2: Keeps king near passed pawns but less active\n- b2a2: Moves king towards a-pawn but away from action\n- b2c1/b2b1/b2a1: Retreating moves that don't help\n- f5f6: Advances passed pawn but allows ...e4\n\nThe best move is f5f6 because:\n1) It advances a passed pawn which is a major asset\n2) After f5f6, if Black plays ...e4, White can play g4g5 creating another passed pawn\n3) The king can support the f-pawn's advance via c3-d4-e5\n4) Other king moves don't create any threats or improve the position\n\n```\nf5f6\n```"
