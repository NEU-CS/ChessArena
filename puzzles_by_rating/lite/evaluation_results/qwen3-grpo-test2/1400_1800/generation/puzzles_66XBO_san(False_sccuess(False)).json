When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on f4 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on a4\n- Black's bishop on c6 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n- White's bishop on b5 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n- e8e7: Centralizes rook but blocks bishop\n- c8e6: Attacks the active white queen\n- c6e5: Centralizes bishop and attacks f4 queen\n- d5d4: Advances passed pawn but may be premature\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6e5 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- It attacks the active white queen on f4\n- If White takes the bishop (Qxe5), Black can play Qd7+ winning the rook on a1\n- If White moves the queen, Black can play Qd7+ anyway\n- It opens the c8-h3 diagonal for the queen\n\nOther moves either don't address White's active pieces or are too passive. c6e5 is the most active and disruptive move.\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
