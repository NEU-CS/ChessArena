Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Knight, Queen, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with R+Q vs Q+N)\n\n2.

Candidate moves:\n- g6h7: Moves king away from center but towards corner\n- g6h5: Moves king towards center but still exposed\n- g6g5: Moves king forward but into potential checks\n- g7f6: Captures the queen but allows Rook to take knight\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- g7f6 seems most forcing as it captures the queen\n- After g7f6, White can play Rookxa5 winning the knight\n- But Black can then play Qxh2 winning a pawn\n- The material would be roughly equal (R vs Q+N)\n- Other king moves don't address the immediate threat of Qh2+\n\n5. Conclusion:\ng7f6 is the best move as it:\n- Removes White's most dangerous piece\n- Maintains material balance\n- Keeps Black's queen active\n- Prevents any immediate threats\n\n```\ng7f6\n```"
