When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g3\n- White's king is on b3\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3\n- White has a rook on e7 controlling the 7th rank\n- Black's rook on d8 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g7: Bishop moves to defend the king, but seems passive\n- d8d4: Rook checks the king, but White can just move away\n- f4f3: Rook moves to attack the pawn on h3, but doesn't accomplish much\n- g3h4: King moves away from potential checks\n- b7b5: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be b7b5:\n- Advances the passed pawn which is a major asset\n- Creates threats against White's pawns\n- If White takes (axb5), Black can play c3c2 promoting the pawn\n- If White doesn't take, the pawn can advance further\n- Maintains all other options for Black's pieces\n\nThe move b7b5 maximizes Black's active pieces and passed pawn while maintaining flexibility. It's the most forcing and dangerous move in the position.\n\n```\nb7b5\n```"
