When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, knight, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on b7 is very active\n- Black's queen on g4 is also active but potentially exposed\n- Black's king on f7 is somewhat exposed\n- White has a knight on d4 controlling key squares\n- Black has a rook on a4 that could be more active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4c8: Queen retreat to defend the rook, but seems passive\n- g4d7: Queen moves to defend the king while attacking the queen\n- a4d4: Rook takes the strong knight, but after Nxd4 Qxd4, White's queen remains strong\n- g4e6: Queen moves to centralize while attacking the knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4d7:\n- Defends the king against potential checks\n- Attacks White's queen on b7\n- If White takes the queen (Qxd7), Black can play Rxd4 winning a piece\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Keeps the queen active in the center\n\nOther moves either don't address the king's safety or don't maximize the queen's activity. g4d7 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\ng4d7\n```"
