When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's bishop on g5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White has a passed pawn on d3 that could be dangerous\n- Black's rook on c8 is blocked by its own pawn on b7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h6: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Qxh6\n- e5f7: Knight check, but Black can block with Qe7\n- d3h7: Queen move threatening h7 pawn, but Black can defend\n- e1g1: Castling to connect rooks and bring king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1g1 (castling) because:\n- Gets the king to safety\n- Connects the rooks\n- Prepares to bring the h1 rook into play\n- Maintains all options for the bishop and knight\n- Black has no immediate threats that require castling\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to consolidate. Castling is the most principled move here.\n\n```\ne1g1\n```"
