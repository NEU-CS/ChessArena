When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a passed pawn on e4 that is close to promotion\n3. White's king is on c3, black's king on e4\n4. White has a pawn on h3, black has no pawns\n5. It's White's move (63rd move)\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. c3c4 - moves towards the black pawn but allows ...e3\n2. c3b4 - moves away from the pawn but doesn't address it\n3. c3b3 - same as b4\n4. c3d2 - moves away from the action\n5. c3c2 - same as d2\n6. c3b2 - same as d2\n7. h3h4 - advances the h-pawn\n\nThe critical factor is stopping Black's e-pawn. The best move is c3c4, which:\n- Cuts off Black's king from advancing (if ...e3, Kd3 stops the pawn)\n- Prepares to capture the pawn if it advances\n- Maintains flexibility to go after the h-pawn later\n\nOther moves either don't address the e-pawn or allow it to promote. h3h4 is tempting but doesn't solve the immediate problem of the passed e-pawn.\n\n```\nc3c4\n```"
