When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Queen, Rook, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Knight, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with queen vs knight)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on b6 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on e6\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black has a rook on a3 and knight on c6\n- White's rook on g6 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e6f7: Moves king towards corner but away from center\n- e6e7: Keeps king more central but still exposed\n- e6d7: Moves king towards queenside but away from action\n- e6f5: Moves king towards center and away from white rook\n- e6e5: Moves king forward but into potential checks\n- d4f6: Moves knight to defend king and control g4\n\n4. Best move is d4f6 because:\n- It defends the king by controlling g4\n- It prevents White's rook from checking on g4\n- It maintains the knight's activity\n- It doesn't expose the king further\n- It's the most proactive move in the position\n\nThe other king moves either expose the king more or don't improve Black's position.\n\n```\nd4f6\n```"
