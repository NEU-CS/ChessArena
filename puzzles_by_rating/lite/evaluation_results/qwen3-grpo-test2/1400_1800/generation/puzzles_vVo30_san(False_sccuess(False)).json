When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on e5\n- White's knight on g3 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on a3 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on c4 that could be advanced\n- Black's h-pawn is threatening to promote\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3h5: Attacks the h2 pawn but allows Black to push h3\n- g3e2: Centralizes the knight but doesn't address immediate threats\n- b3a4: Captures the dangerous a3 pawn\n- c4c5: Advances the passed pawn but leaves a3 pawn unchecked\n\n4. Best move seems to be b3a4:\n- Removes Black's dangerous passed pawn\n- After bxa4, White can play c5 advancing the passed pawn\n- Black's h-pawn can be stopped by Kb4\n- White's knight remains very active\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat of the a3 pawn or allow Black to create counterplay. Capturing the a3 pawn is the most forcing and beneficial move.\n\n```\nb3a4\n```"
