When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and queen vs Black's rook, bishop and knight. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on d7\n- White's queen on b7 is very active\n- Black has a bishop on c4 controlling important squares\n- White has a passed pawn on b5\n- Black's rook on h8 is not very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7c8: Queen checks the king, but Black can block with ...Qe7\n- b7d5: Centralizes queen and attacks the bishop on c4\n- a7b8: Moves bishop to safety but doesn't accomplish much\n- e1e8: Centralizes rook but doesn't create threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be b7d5 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the bishop on c4\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can play Qxc4 winning a piece\n- If Black doesn't move the bishop, White can play Qd4+ winning the rook on h8\n- It maintains all of White's threats while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow Black to consolidate. b7d5 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\nb7d5\n```"
