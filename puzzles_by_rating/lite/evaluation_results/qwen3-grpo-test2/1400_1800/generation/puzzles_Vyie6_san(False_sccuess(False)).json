When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's king is exposed on c4\n- Black's bishop is very active on b4\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4\n- White has a passed pawn on g3\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b4c3: Attacks the white king directly and threatens to win material\n- b4d2: Checks the king, but White can just move away\n- a4a3: Advances the passed pawn\n- g8h8: Moves the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be b4c3 because:\n- It directly attacks the white king\n- If White takes the bishop (Bxc3), Black can play a4a3 creating a passed pawn\n- If White moves the king, Black can play a4a3 anyway\n- It maintains Black's active bishop while putting pressure on White\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow White to consolidate. The direct attack on the king is most forcing.\n\n```\nb4c3\n```"
