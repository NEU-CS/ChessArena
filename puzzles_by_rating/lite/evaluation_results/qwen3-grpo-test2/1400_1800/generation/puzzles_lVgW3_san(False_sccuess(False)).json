When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5\n- White's queen is very active on f3\n- Black's bishop on d8 is blocked by pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- d8e7: Centralizes the queen and connects rooks\n- f6e4: Attacks the e4 pawn and opens lines\n- b5b4: Advances the passed pawn\n- a5a4: Advances the a-pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6e4:\n- Attacks the e4 pawn which is currently unprotected\n- If White takes the knight (Qxe4), Black can play Qd7+ winning the rook on a1\n- If White doesn't take, Black gains time to improve position\n- Opens the f-file for the rook\n- Maintains pressure in the center\n\nOther moves either don't address the active White pieces or are too passive. f6e4 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nf6e4\n```"
