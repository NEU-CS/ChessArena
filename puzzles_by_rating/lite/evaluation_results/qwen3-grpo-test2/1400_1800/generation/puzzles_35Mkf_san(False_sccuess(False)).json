When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on e4\n- Black's bishop on c5 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White has a rook on f1 pointing at Black's king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h4: Queen check, but White can block with g3\n- c5e3: Bishop takes pawn, but White can play Qxe3\n- c6d4: Knight takes pawn, but White can play Qxd4\n- d8d4: Queen takes pawn, but White can play Qxd4\n- c5f2: Bishop check, but White can play Kxf2\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5e3:\n- It wins a pawn\n- If White takes the bishop (Qxe3), Black can play Qh4+ winning the rook on f1\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play Qh4+ next move anyway\n- It maintains Black's active bishop pair\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow White to maintain the initiative. c5e3 is the most forcing and wins material.\n\n```\nc5e3\n```"
