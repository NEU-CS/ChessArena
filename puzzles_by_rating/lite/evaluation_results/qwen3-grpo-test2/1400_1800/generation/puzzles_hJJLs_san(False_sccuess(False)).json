When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, pawns vs White's rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on d4\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's rook on d8 is semi-trapped\n- White has a passed pawn on e4\n- Black's bishop on a6 is blocked by pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4e4: Capturing the passed pawn, but White can play Qd2 defending\n- d4d3: Attacking the bishop, but White can just move it\n- d4e3: Checking the king, but White can take the queen\n- d4f2: Attacking the rook, but White can defend\n- a6c8: Developing the bishop, but it's not very active\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4e4:\n- It eliminates White's dangerous passed pawn\n- After Qd2, Black can play Qe4d3 attacking the bishop\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play Qd3e3+ winning the rook\n- Even if White finds a defense, Black maintains strong activity\n\nThe move d4e4 is the most forcing and creates immediate problems for White while improving Black's position.\n\n```\nd4e4\n```"
