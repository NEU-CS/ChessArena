When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and knight vs White's bishop and knight, so material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on d5 that's very active\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- Black's bishop on g7 is blocked by pawns\n- White has a passed pawn on e4\n- Black's knight on c5 is under attack by White's pawn on c3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5d7: Retreating the knight to safety while maintaining control\n- c5e6: Centralizing the knight and attacking the e4 pawn\n- e8g8: Castling to get the king to safety\n- g7f6: Developing the bishop and attacking the d5 knight\n\n4. Evaluating the best move:\n- c5e6 looks strong as it centralizes the knight and puts pressure on e4\n- After c5e6, if White takes the knight (d5e6), Black can play f7f5 attacking the e4 pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black maintains pressure on e4\n- Other moves either don't address the active White knight or don't develop pieces\n\nThe most active and challenging move is c5e6, putting immediate pressure on White's position while improving Black's piece coordination.\n\n```\nc5e6\n```"
