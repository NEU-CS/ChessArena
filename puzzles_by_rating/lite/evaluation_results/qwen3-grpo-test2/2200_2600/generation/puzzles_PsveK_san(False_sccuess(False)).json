When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is more active (h6) while White's king is on f4\n- Black has a passed pawn on h4 that's advanced\n- White has pawns on g3 and f3 that could potentially advance\n- Black's f5 pawn is blocking White's king from advancing\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- h6h7: Moves king away from action, not helpful\n- h6g7: Moves king towards center but away from pawns\n- h6h5: Moves king towards pawns but may be too slow\n- h4g3: Captures a pawn but allows White's king to approach\n- g6g5: Advances the f5 pawn, creating a passed pawn\n\n4. Best move is g6g5 because:\n- Creates a passed pawn on f5 that White must deal with\n- After f5-f4, White's king can't stop both the h-pawn and f-pawn\n- If White takes the g5 pawn (Kxg5), then h4-h3 creates a passed pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can push f5-f4 creating serious threats\n\nThe move g6g5 is the most active and creates the most problems for White.\n\n```\ng6g5\n```"
