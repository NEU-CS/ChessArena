When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, knight and pawns vs White's rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on c6\n- White has a passed pawn on g5 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a knight on e3 that's very active\n- White's rook on e2 is controlling the e-file\n- Black's rook on h8 is not very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Centralizes the rook but doesn't address any immediate threats\n- e3d5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the g5 pawn\n- e3g4: Attacks the g5 pawn directly\n- e5e4: Advances the pawn but leaves the king more exposed\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3g4:\n- Directly attacks the dangerous g5 pawn\n- If White takes the knight (fxg4), Black can play h8h4 attacking the pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can bring the rook into play via h8h4\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n\nOther moves either don't address the g5 pawn or expose the king unnecessarily. e3g4 is the most active and purposeful move.\n\n```\ne3g4\n```"
