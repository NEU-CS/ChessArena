When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's bishop, queen, pawns and a bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on c4 that could be dangerous\n- Black's bishop on g4 is very active\n- White's bishop on d5 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g8h8: Moves king to corner, but doesn't address any threats\n- g8f8: Moves king towards center but still passive\n- g8g7: Keeps king more active but still vulnerable\n- d7f7: Moves queen to defend g6 pawn but blocks bishop\n- d7e6: Centralizes queen and attacks d5 bishop\n- g4e6: Bishop takes pawn, but allows White to play Bxe6\n\n4. Best move is d7e6 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the strong d5 bishop\n- If White takes the queen (Bxe6), Black can play Bxe6 and have a slightly better position\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play Qxd5 winning a pawn\n- It maintains all of Black's pieces active\n\nThe move d7e6 is the most active and puts pressure on White's position.\n\n```\nd7e6\n```"
