When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, knight, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. White is up material (queen vs rook).\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on h4 is very active\n- White's knight on f7 is threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on d7\n- White has a passed pawn on b7 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7h8: Captures the rook but allows Qxh8\n- f7d8: Checks the king, but Kc7 escapes\n- b7c8: Promotes the pawn to queen, but Black can play Qxc8\n- c3d5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the bishop\n- h1g1: Moves the rook to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be f7h6:\n- Attacks the queen on h4\n- If Qxh6, then b7b8Q+ wins material as the king can't take the new queen\n- If queen moves away, we can play b7b8Q with a strong attack\n- Maintains pressure while avoiding any counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't maximize our advantage or allow Black to counterplay. f7h6 is the most forcing and maintains our material and positional advantage.\n\n```\nf7h6\n```"
