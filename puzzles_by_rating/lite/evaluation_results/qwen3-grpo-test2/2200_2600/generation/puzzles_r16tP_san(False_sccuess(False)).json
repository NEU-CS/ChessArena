When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on b7 that's very advanced\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's bishop on g5 is very active\n- Black's queen on c8 is blocked by its own pawn on d7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7b8: Promoting the pawn immediately, but Black can play Qc8b7 to capture it\n- g5e7: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Qc8e8 defending\n- d3d6: Centralizing the queen and attacking the pawn on d7\n- c3d5: Knight jump to a strong central square\n\n4. Best move seems to be d3d6:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the d7 pawn which is Black's only real weakness\n- If Black takes the queen (Qxd6), White can play b7b8 promoting the pawn\n- If Black moves the queen, White can play b7b8 promoting anyway\n- Maintains all of White's threats while improving piece coordination\n\nOther moves either don't address Black's defenses or miss this opportunity to centralize the queen and attack Black's structure.\n\n```\nd3d6\n```"
