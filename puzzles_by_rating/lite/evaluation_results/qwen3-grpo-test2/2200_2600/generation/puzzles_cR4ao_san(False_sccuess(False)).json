When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen and rook vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e6 is very active\n- Black's queen on g2 is attacking the bishop on d3\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n- White has a passed pawn on b5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g2d5: Centralizes the queen and attacks the b5 pawn\n- g2e4: Attacks the bishop and controls more squares\n- g2g7: Defends the rook but seems passive\n- h4h3: Advances the pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be g2d5 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the b5 pawn which is a potential threat\n- If White takes the queen (Qxd5), Black can play Qxd5 and then capture the bishop\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n- It's more active than other options\n\nThe move g2d5 maximizes Black's activity and creates threats while maintaining material balance.\n\n```\ng2d5\n```"
