When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawn vs Black's bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's bishop is active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on e7 is very active\n- Black's bishop on c4 is controlling important squares\n- Black has passed pawns on d3 and f5\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- e7h7: Attacks the g6 pawn, but Black can defend\n- e7g7: Blocks the g6 pawn's advance\n- e7f7: Protects the f2 pawn\n- g3g4: Advances pawn but weakens structure\n- h2h4: Prepares h4-h5 to stop Black's pawns\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7g7:\n- Blocks the g6 pawn's advance\n- Maintains control of the 7th rank\n- Prevents Black from playing ...g5 to open lines\n- Keeps options to double on the g-file or move to h7\n- Doesn't allow any counterplay from Black\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to activate their pawns. e7g7 is the most solid move that maintains White's advantage.\n\n```\ne7g7\n```"
