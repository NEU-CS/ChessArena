When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawns vs White's queen and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on f6\n- Black's queen is on g4, attacking the g3 pawn\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3\n- White's king is exposed on g2\n- Black's king is relatively safe on h6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4g3: Captures the pawn but allows Qxg3, losing the queen\n- g4e2: Checks the king, but White can just take the queen\n- d4e3: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the queen\n- c3c2: Advances the passed pawn\n- g4f3: Attacks the g3 pawn while keeping the queen safe\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4f3:\n- Attacks the g3 pawn\n- If White takes queen (Qxf3), Black can play c3c2 with a strong passed pawn\n- If White moves queen, Black can play c3c2 anyway\n- Maintains queen safety while being active\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't improve Black's position as much. g4f3 is the most active and safe move.\n\n```\ng4f3\n```"
