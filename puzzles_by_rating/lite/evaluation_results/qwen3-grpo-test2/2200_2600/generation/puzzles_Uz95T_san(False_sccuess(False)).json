When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- White has a passed pawn on e4\n- Black has a knight on e5 that's very active\n- White's bishop on d4 is strong, controlling important squares\n- Black's queen on g7 is somewhat restricted by pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f7: Centralizing the knight and attacking the bishop on d4\n- e5d7: Protecting the king and attacking the e4 pawn\n- g7h7: Moving the queen to a safer square\n- e8g8: Castling to get the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5f7:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the strong bishop on d4\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play ...d6-d5 gaining space\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n- It's more active than castling which would be too passive\n\nOther moves like e5d7 are okay but don't attack anything. Queen moves don't improve Black's position. Castling would be too passive in this position where Black needs to be active.\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
