When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a king and rook vs White's king, bishop and pawns. Black is down material but has some counterplay.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on c6 that could be dangerous\n- Black's rook is active on h2, attacking the g3 pawn\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White's king is on b4, far from the action\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h2h3: Attacks the g3 pawn directly. If White defends with Bf5, Black can play Rh4 attacking the pawn again.\n- h2g2: Covers the g3 pawn from another angle, but less direct.\n- g7g6: Creates luft for the king but doesn't address immediate threats.\n- e6e5: Centralizes the pawn but doesn't create threats.\n\n4. Best move seems to be h2h3:\n- Immediately threatens the g3 pawn\n- If White plays Bf5 to defend, Black can play Rh4 winning the pawn\n- If White doesn't defend, Black can take the pawn next move\n- Maintains pressure while keeping options open\n\nThe move h2h3 is the most forcing and creates immediate threats that White must address.\n\n```\nh2h3\n```"
