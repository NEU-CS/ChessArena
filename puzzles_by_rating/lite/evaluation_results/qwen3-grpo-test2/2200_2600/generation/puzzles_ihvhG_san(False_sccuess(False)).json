When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's knight and bishop. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on d5 that's very active\n- Black has a pawn on g3 that's threatening to advance\n- White's king is castled but Black has the option to castle queenside\n- Black's knight on c6 is pinned to the queen by White's bishop on e2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7: Captures the bishop but allows Black to play ...g2 winning a pawn\n- e2h5: Attacks the g3 pawn but allows ...g2\n- f1f7: Centralizes the rook and attacks the pinned knight\n- d5f6: Moves the knight to a safe square while maintaining pressure\n\n4. Best move seems to be f1f7:\n- Centralizes the rook\n- Attacks the pinned knight on c6\n- If Black takes the rook with ...Nxf7, White can play Bxg3 winning a pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure\n- Prevents Black from castling queenside as the rook would be hanging\n\nOther moves either allow Black to win a pawn or don't maximize White's active pieces. f1f7 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\nf1f7\n```"
