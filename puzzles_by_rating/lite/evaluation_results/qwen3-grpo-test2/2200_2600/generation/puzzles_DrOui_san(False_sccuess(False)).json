When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a knight on g4 attacking f2\n- White's knight on d5 is very active\n- Black's bishop on c5 is pinning White's bishop on c4 to the king\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black's king is castled but White has potential to open lines\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7: Captures the bishop but allows Black to play Qd7 defending\n- d5f6: Attacks the g4 knight but doesn't address the pin\n- c4a6: Breaks the pin but loses the bishop\n- d1g4: Captures the knight but allows Bxc4\n- f1f3: Defends f2 but blocks the bishop\n\n4. Best move seems to be d1g4:\n- Captures the dangerous knight on g4\n- After Bxc4, White can play Qxc4 maintaining material equality\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Qxg4 winning a piece\n- It's the most forcing move in the position\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or lose material. d1g4 is the most precise.\n\n```\nd1g4\n```"
