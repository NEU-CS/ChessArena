When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight, queen and pawns. Black is down a queen for a bishop, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong knight on d6 controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's queen on d3 is very active\n- Black's bishop on h6 is blocked by its own pawn on g6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h8: Moving the rook to h8 to defend the h6 bishop, but this seems passive\n- e7h4: Moving the knight to attack the queen, but White can just move the queen\n- h6g5: Moving the bishop to g5 to activate it, but it's still blocked by pawns\n- e7f6: Moving the knight to attack the strong d6 knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7f6:\n- It attacks the strong d6 knight\n- If White takes the knight (Nxf6), Black can play Qe7+ winning the bishop on e2\n- If White doesn't take, Black maintains pressure\n- It opens the e7 square for the queen to potentially check the king\n\nThis move addresses the immediate threat of the d6 knight while creating counterplay. It's the most active option in a difficult position.\n\n```\ne7f6\n```"
