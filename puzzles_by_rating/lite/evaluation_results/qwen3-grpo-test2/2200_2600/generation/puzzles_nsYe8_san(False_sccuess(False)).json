When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (king + pawns). Black has pawns on a4, e5, f5, h5; White has pawns on b3, c4, g3, h3.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is more active (a6) while White's king is on d3\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n- The f5 pawn is under attack by White's g3 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a6b7: Moves king towards center but away from passed a-pawn\n- a6a7: Similar to b7, not improving much\n- a6b6: Keeps king near passed pawn but doesn't advance it\n- a6a5: Puts king in front of passed pawn, protecting it\n- h5g4: Captures pawn but opens h-file for White's king\n- f5g4: Captures pawn but leaves e5 pawn weak\n- f7f6: Doesn't accomplish much\n- h5h4: Advances pawn but doesn't address immediate issues\n- f5f4: Creates passed pawn but weakens e5\n- e5e4: Advances pawn but gives up control of d4\n\n4. Best move seems to be a6a5:\n- Protects the passed a-pawn\n- Prepares to advance it (a4-a3 next move)\n- Keeps king active\n- Prevents White from playing b3-b4 to stop the a-pawn\n- Maintains flexibility for other pawns\n\nThe move a6a5 is the most precise, improving Black's position while maintaining all options.\n\n```\na6a5\n```"
