When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\nMaterial is equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on c7\n- White's rook on a6 is very active\n- Black's rook on a1 is threatening White's king\n- White's bishop on f6 is controlling important squares\n- Black's bishop on f5 is very active\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- d1d2: Moves the king away from the rook's attack, but allows Black to play ...Bd3+ winning the rook on a6\n- f6a1: Captures the rook, but after ...Bxa1, Black's bishop remains very active and White's king is still exposed\n\n4. Better alternative:\nActually, there's a better move not listed (Kd2), but since we must choose from the given options:\n- f6a1 is the only move that doesn't lose material immediately\n- After f6a1 Bd3+ is possible, but then Kd2 and White can defend\n\nThe best move is to capture the rook, as not doing so would lose material immediately.\n\n```\nf6a1\n```"
