Candidate moves analysis:\n- a4b5: Moves king towards center but allows c3, advancing black's passed pawn\n- a4a5: Moves king forward but doesn't address the c4 pawn\n- a4b4: Best move - attacks the c4 pawn directly\n- a4a3: Moves king away from action\n- b2b3: Stops c3 but allows black to play f5-f4\n- b2b4: Allows c3 and doesn't stop f-pawn\n\n4. Best move is a4b4 because:\n- Directly attacks the dangerous c4 pawn\n- If black plays c3, White can take: b4c3\n- If black doesn't take, White can capture the pawn next move\n- Maintains flexibility to stop the f-pawn later\n\n```\na4b4\n```"

Black has a passed pawn on c4 that is very dangerous\n3. White's king is well placed to stop the c-pawn\n4. Black's king is active and can support the c-pawn\n5. White has pawns on b2 and c3, Black has pawns on c4 and e5\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b4c5 - moves king towards black's pawns but allows c4c3\n2. b4b5 - moves king forward but doesn't address the c-pawn\n3. b4a5 - moves king away from action\n4. b4c4 - captures the dangerous passed pawn\n5. b4a4 - moves king sideways\n6. b4a3 - moves king backwards\n7. b2b3 - creates a passed pawn but allows c4c3\nThe best move is b4c4, capturing the dangerous passed pawn. Here's why:\n- After b4c4, if black plays e5e4, white can play c4d3 stopping the c-pawn\n- If black plays c4c3, white can play c4b3 winning the pawn\n- Other moves either allow the c-pawn to advance or don't address the immediate threat\nThis is a critical moment where eliminating the passed pawn is essential to holding the position. The other moves either don't address the threat or create new weaknesses.\n```\nb4c4\n```"
