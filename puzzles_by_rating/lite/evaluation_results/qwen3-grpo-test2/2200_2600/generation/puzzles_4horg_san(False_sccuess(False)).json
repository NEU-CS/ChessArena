When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Black is down a knight but has some compensation with the active queen and rook.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on e7 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's queen on a3 is active but potentially exposed\n- Black's rook on d8 is blocked by the knight on e7\n- White has a passed pawn on a2 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a3d6: Centralizes the queen and attacks the strong knight on e7\n- a3a6: Moves the queen to safety while maintaining pressure on a2 pawn\n- d8d7: Moves the rook out of the knight's control\n- h8g8: Connects the rooks\n\n4. Best move seems to be a3d6 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the strong e7 knight\n- If White takes the queen (Nxd6), Black can play Rxd6 winning the knight\n- If White moves the knight, Black can play Qa5+ winning the a2 pawn\n- It's the most active move in the position\n\nOther moves either don't address the strong knight or allow White to maintain pressure.\n\n```\na3d6\n```"
