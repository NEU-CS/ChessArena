When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f5\n- White's knight on b8 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n- Black's bishop on e8 is blocked by its own pawn on h5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b8d7: Centralizes the knight and attacks the b5 pawn\n- b8c6: Attacks the f5 king and controls important squares\n- d3d4: Advances the king towards the center\n- c4b5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- c4b5 seems most urgent as it eliminates Black's passed pawn\n- After c4b5, if Black recaptures with a6b5, White can play b8d7 attacking the bishop\n- Other knight moves don't address the immediate threat of the b5 pawn\n- King moves are too slow\n\nThe best move is to capture the dangerous passed pawn immediately:\n\n```\nc4b5\n```"
