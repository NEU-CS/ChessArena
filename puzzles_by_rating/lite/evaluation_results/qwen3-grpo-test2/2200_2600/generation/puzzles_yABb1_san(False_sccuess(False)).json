When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and pawn vs Black's bishop and pawn. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's knight on e5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on d6\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's rook on d6 is tied to defending the d6 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f7: Knight check, but Black can block with Qe7\n- e5d7: Captures the bishop, but Black can play Qxd7\n- e3h6: Threatens to win the h7 pawn\n- c5b6: Advances the passed pawn\n- e5g6: Centralizes the knight while attacking f8\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5d7:\n- It wins the bishop for a knight (material gain)\n- After Qxd7, White can play Qe4+ winning the rook on d6\n- Even if Black doesn't take the knight, White maintains pressure\n- It's the most forcing move in the position\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow Black to consolidate. e5d7 is the most concrete way to gain an advantage.\n\n```\ne5d7\n```"
