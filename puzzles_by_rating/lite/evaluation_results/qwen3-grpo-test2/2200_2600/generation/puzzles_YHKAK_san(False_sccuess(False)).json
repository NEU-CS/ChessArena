When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's queen is very active on a7\n- Black has a knight on e3 controlling important squares\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has a pawn on e4 that's blocking White's d-pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a7b8: Queen checks the king, but Black can just take the queen with the king\n- a7g7: Centralizes the queen and attacks the g7 pawn\n- g2e4: Captures the e4 pawn, but allows Black to play ...Nf5 attacking the bishop\n- d4d5: Advances the passed pawn, but Black can play ...Nf5 attacking it\n- a3a4: Prepares to advance the a-pawn, but seems slow\n\n4. Best move seems to be a7g7:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the g7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If Black takes the queen (Qxg7), White can play Bxe3 winning the knight\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Qxg7 winning a pawn\n- Maintains all of White's threats while improving the queen's position\n\n```\na7g7\n```"
