When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on a5\n- White's king is exposed on e1\n- Black has a bishop on h3 controlling important squares\n- White's bishop on g3 is blocked by its own pawn on f2\n- Black's knight on d7 is somewhat restricted\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a5a4: Centralizes the queen and threatens to invade on a4\n- h3g4: Attacks the bishop on g3\n- d7e5: Centralizes the knight and attacks f3\n- a5c3: Attacks the bishop on b3\n\n4. Best move seems to be h3g4:\n- It directly attacks the bishop on g3\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play a5a4+ winning the pawn on a2\n- If White plays Bf5, Black can play Qa4+ winning the pawn\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n\nOther moves like a5a4 are good but don't immediately threaten anything. h3g4 is more forcing and creates immediate problems for White.\n\n```\nh3g4\n```"
