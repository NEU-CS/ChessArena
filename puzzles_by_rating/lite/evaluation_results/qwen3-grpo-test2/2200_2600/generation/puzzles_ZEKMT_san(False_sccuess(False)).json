When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, pawns vs White's queen, bishop, pawns. Black is down a queen for a rook, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g4\n- White's queen on c5 is very active\n- Black has a queen on b2 attacking White's pawn on g2\n- White has a bishop on d3 controlling important squares\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n- g4h5: Moves king away from center but still exposed\n- g4g5: Moves king forward, but doesn't address any threats\n- g4h4: Moves king towards corner, but h4 is controlled by White's bishop\n- g4f4: Moves king towards center but away from immediate threats\n\n4. Best move is g4f4 because:\n- Gets the king to relative safety away from the center\n- Avoids any potential checks from White's queen\n- Keeps the king away from White's bishop on d3\n- Maintains the queen's attack on g2\n- Doesn't walk into any potential pins or checks\n\nThe other moves either leave the king more exposed or don't improve the position. g4f4 is the most prudent move in this difficult position.\n\n```\ng4f4\n```"
