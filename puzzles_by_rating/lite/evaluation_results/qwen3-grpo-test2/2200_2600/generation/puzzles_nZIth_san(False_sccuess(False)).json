When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on a6 that's very dangerous\n- Black's knight is well placed on b5, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on e7\n- White's king is active on c4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7f6: Centralizes the king and gets it closer to the action\n- b5d4: Attacks the c4 king and controls the a7 square\n- b5c3: Attacks the a6 pawn directly\n- h7h5: Creates luft for the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be b5c3:\n- It directly attacks the a6 pawn\n- If White defends with Kd3, Black can play Nxa4 winning the pawn\n- If White pushes a7, Black can play Nxa4 followed by Kf6 to stop the pawn\n- It maintains control of key squares while keeping the knight active\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or don't improve Black's position as much. The knight is Black's most active piece and should be used to maximum effect.\n\n```\nb5c3\n```"
