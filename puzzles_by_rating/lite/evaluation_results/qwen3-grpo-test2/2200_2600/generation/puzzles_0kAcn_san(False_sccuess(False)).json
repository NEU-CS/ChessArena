When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on d8\n- Black's bishop on c5 is blocked by its own pawn on e6\n- White has a passed pawn on a3 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the rook out of potential pins\n- d8e7: Moves the king to a safer square\n- c5d4: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the a1 rook\n- b6b4: Attacks the a3 pawn\n\n4. Threats:\n- White could play Qh5-g5+ winning the f6 pawn\n- White could push a3-a2 creating a passed pawn\n\nAfter considering these factors, the best move seems to be c5d4 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- It attacks the a1 rook which is currently undefended\n- It prevents Qg5+ by controlling g5\n- It maintains flexibility for the king to move to e7 if needed\n\nThe move c5d4 addresses multiple concerns while improving Black's piece activity.\n\n```\nc5d4\n```"
