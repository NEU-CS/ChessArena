When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and pawns vs White's rook, rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f4\n- White has two rooks controlling the 5th rank\n- Black has a rook on e2 and another on g2\n- White's king is on f1\n- Black has a passed pawn on h7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4g5: Moves king towards center but exposes it more\n- g2g4: Attacks the f3 pawn but leaves e2 rook hanging\n- e2e4: Centralizes the rook and attacks the f3 pawn\n- h7h5: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2e4 because:\n- Centralizes the rook\n- Attacks the f3 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If White takes the rook (Rxe4), Black can play h7h5 advancing the passed pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can double rooks on the e-file\n- Maintains protection of the g2 rook\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to gain an advantage. The e2e4 move puts maximum pressure on White's position.\n\n```\ne2e4\n```"
