When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on a2 that's close to promotion\n- White's bishop is very active on d4\n- Black's king is exposed on e6\n- White's rook on f4 is controlling the 4th rank\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4h8: Bishop checks the king, but Black can just take the rook\n- d4a7: Bishop attacks the a2 pawn, but Black can defend it\n- f4f5: Advances the rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d4e5: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the f4 rook\n- a5a6: Pushes the pawn but doesn't address the a2 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4e5 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks the f4 rook, forcing Black to move it or lose it\n- If Black moves the rook, White can play a5a6 pushing the pawn\n- If Black takes the bishop (e6e5), White can play f4f5 with a strong passed pawn\n\nThis move maximizes White's activity while addressing the immediate threats.\n\n```\nd4e5\n```"
