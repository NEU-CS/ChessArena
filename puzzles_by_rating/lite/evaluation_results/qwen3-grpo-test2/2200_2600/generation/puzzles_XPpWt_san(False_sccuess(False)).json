When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawns vs White's bishop and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's king is exposed on h5\n- Black's king is on f7\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black has a passed pawn on g5\n- Black's bishop is very active on f8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8g7: Blocks the g5 pawn but doesn't accomplish much\n- f8e7: Centralizes the bishop but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- f8d6: Attacks the d5 pawn but allows White to push d6\n- f8c5: Pins the d5 pawn to the king - this looks interesting\n- f8b4: Not very active\n- f8a3: Too passive\n- f7g8: Moves king away from center\n- f7e7: Centralizes king but doesn't address pawn play\n- c6c5: Releases the d5 pawn but gives up the c6 pawn\n- g5g4: Advances the passed pawn but may be premature\n\n4. Best move seems to be f8c5:\n- It pins the d5 pawn to the king\n- If White takes the bishop (Bxc5), Black can play g5g4 with a strong passed pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can maintain the pin and possibly win the d5 pawn\n- It's the most active move that creates immediate threats\n\n```\nf8c5\n```"
