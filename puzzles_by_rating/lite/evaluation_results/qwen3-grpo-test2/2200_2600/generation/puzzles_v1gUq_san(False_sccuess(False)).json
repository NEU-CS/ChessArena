When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and rook vs White's queen and bishop. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on h4 is very active\n- White's queen is exposed on g3\n- Black has a passed pawn on b2 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is exposed on f1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4h5: Attacks the f3 pawn and threatens to swing to g4\n- b2e5: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the queen\n- f6e5: Centralizes the queen and attacks the bishop\n- h4g4: Directly attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be h4g4:\n- It directly attacks the exposed queen\n- If queen moves, Black can play b2e5 winning the bishop\n- If White plays Qxg4, then Bxe5 wins the bishop\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while increasing pressure\n\nOther moves like b2e5 are good but don't attack the queen immediately. h4h5 is solid but less forcing. The direct attack on the queen is most compelling.\n\n```\nh4g4\n```"
