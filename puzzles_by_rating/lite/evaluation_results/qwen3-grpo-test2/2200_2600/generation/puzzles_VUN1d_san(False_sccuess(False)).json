When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Black is down a minor piece (knight vs bishop).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n- Black's bishop on f7 is blocked by its own pawn on h6\n- White's knight on e4 is centralized\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n- e8e7: Centralizes the rook but blocks the bishop\n- d8h4: Attacks the active queen, but Qxh4 is possible\n- d8g5: Pins the queen to the king, but White can play Qxg5\n- f7f6: Opens the bishop's diagonal and challenges the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be f7f6:\n- Opens the diagonal for the bishop\n- Challenges White's active queen\n- If Qxh6, Black can play Bg7 winning the exchange\n- If Q moves away, Black gains time to consolidate\n- Prevents any immediate threats against the king\n\nOther moves either don't address the active queen or leave the king exposed. f7f6 is the most active and challenging response.\n\n```\nf7f6\n```"
