When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's queen is very active on f6\n- White's queen on h5 is exposed\n- Black has a bishop pair\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5h3: Attacks the exposed white queen while developing the bishop\n- f6g5: Centralizes the queen and attacks the h5 queen\n- f5g4: Pins the g3 pawn to the king\n- e5e4: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be f5h3:\n- It directly attacks the exposed white queen\n- If White moves the queen, Black can play f6g5+ winning the h5 queen\n- If White doesn't move the queen, Black can play f5h3 followed by f6g5+ winning material\n- It's a forcing move that creates immediate threats\n\nOther moves like f6g5 are good but don't create the same level of immediate pressure. The pin with f5g4 is less effective as White can defend it.\n\n```\nf5h3\n```"
