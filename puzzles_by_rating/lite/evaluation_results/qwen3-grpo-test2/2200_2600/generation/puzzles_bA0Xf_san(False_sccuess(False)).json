When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's king is exposed on h4 but has some pawn cover\n- Black has a passed pawn on e5\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's rook on b4 is active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4h3: Gets the king to safer square but doesn't address other issues\n- e3c5: Centralizes bishop and attacks black's rook\n- a3a6: Pushes passed pawn but allows ...b5\n- d1d4: Centralizes queen and attacks e5 pawn\n- d5d6: Advances passed pawn but may be premature\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3c5 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks the active black rook on b4\n- If Black moves the rook, we can play d1d4 next, centralizing the queen\n- It maintains pressure on Black's position\n- It doesn't allow any counterplay from Black\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow Black to become more active. e3c5 is the most forcing and improves our piece activity.\n\n```\ne3c5\n```"
