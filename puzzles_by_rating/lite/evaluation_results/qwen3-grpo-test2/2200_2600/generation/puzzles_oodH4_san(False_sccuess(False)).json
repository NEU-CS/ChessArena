When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on a3\n- White's bishop on e3 is blocked by its own pawn on d4\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's rook on c8 is semi-trapped\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a3e3: Capturing the bishop would be great, but White can play d4d5 protecting it\n- a5b3: This looks interesting, attacking the bishop and opening lines\n- c8c1: Trying to activate the rook, but seems slow\n- a3b2: Threatening to capture the a2 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be a5b3:\n- It attacks the bishop on e3\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play a3e3 winning material\n- If White plays d4d5, Black can play a3e3 anyway as the bishop is still blocked\n- It opens the a-file for Black's rook\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow White to consolidate. a5b3 is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for White.\n\n```\na5b3\n```"
