When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, queen, bishop and pawns. Black is up in material (queen vs bishop).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on c5 is very active\n- White's rook on h6 is attacking the g6 pawn\n- Black's bishop on a4 is pinning the c2 pawn to the king\n- White's king is exposed on d1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h7: Captures the g6 pawn but allows Black to play Qd4+ winning material\n- d2d8: Checks the king but Black can block with Rf8\n- d2a5: Captures the bishop but allows Qd4+ winning the rook\n- e4e5: Pushes the pawn to challenge Black's queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4e5:\n- It challenges Black's active queen\n- If Qxe5, then Rg6+ wins the queen back\n- If Qc4, then Rg6+ still looks strong\n- It opens the e-file for White's rook\n- It prevents Black from playing Qd4+ \n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. e4e5 is the most active and challenging move in the position.\n\n```\ne4e5\n```"
