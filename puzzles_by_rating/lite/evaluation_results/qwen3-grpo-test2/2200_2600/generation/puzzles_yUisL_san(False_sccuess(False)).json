When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen and pawns. Black is down a queen for a knight, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on f3 is very active\n- Black's king on c6 is exposed\n- White has a passed pawn on c3\n- Black's rook on e5 is under attack by White's rook on d4\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c6c7: Moves king away from center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c6b6: Similar to c6c7, doesn't solve problems\n- c6c5: Moves king towards center but still leaves rook hanging\n- c6b5: Moves king towards a pawn but leaves rook hanging\n- e7d5: Moves knight to defend rook but allows Qxd5\n- e5d5: Captures the attacking rook but allows Qxd5+\n- e5e4: Moves rook but allows Qxd5+\n\n4. Best move is e5d5:\n- It eliminates the dangerous attacking rook\n- After Qxd5+, Black can play Kc7 and the position is more manageable\n- Other moves either lose material or leave the king in danger\n\nThe move e5d5 is the most forcing and reduces White's attacking potential while maintaining material balance.\n\n```\ne5d5\n```"
