Key features of the position:\n- White's king is on b6, Black's king on g3\n- Black has a bishop on g2, White has a bishop on e2\n- Black has pawns on c5, f5, g4; White has pawns on a5, c4\n- Black's g4 pawn is passed and advanced\n- White's a5 pawn is passed but blocked by Black's c5 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3h4: Moves king towards center but away from pawns\n- g3h3: Keeps king near pawns but doesn't advance\n- g3h2: Moves king towards White's bishop\n- g3f2: Moves king towards center and away from pawns\n- g2h3: Moves bishop to attack White's king\n- g2f3: Moves bishop to control more squares\n- g2h1: Moves bishop to corner\n- g2f1: Moves bishop to corner\n- g5g4: Advances passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g5g4:\n- Advances the passed pawn which is Black's best chance\n- If White takes (fxg4), Black can play Bf3 attacking the a5 pawn\n- If White doesn't take, the pawn can promote\n- Other moves either don't advance the position or move pieces away from key action\n\nThe passed pawn is Black's winning resource, so advancing it is priority.\n\n```\ng5g4\n```"
