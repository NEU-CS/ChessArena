When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's king is more active (c5 vs Black's c7)\n- Black has a passed pawn on f5\n- White has a passed pawn on f4\n- Black's e6 pawn is blocked by White's f4 pawn\n- White's h4 pawn is advanced but not yet threatening\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c7d8: Moves king towards center but away from action\n- c7c8: Similar to d8, not helpful\n- c7b8: Moves king away from action\n- c7d7: Keeps king flexible but doesn't address anything\n- c7b7: Moves king towards queenside where there's no action\n- f6f5: Advances passed pawn but allows Kd6 winning it\n- e6e5: Advances pawn, creating a passed pawn while maintaining f5\n\n4. Best move is e6e5 because:\n- Creates a passed e-pawn\n- Maintains the f5 pawn as a threat\n- If White takes f5 pawn (Kd6), Black can play e4 creating another passed pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can advance e-pawn\n- Keeps king options open\n\n```\ne6e5\n```"
