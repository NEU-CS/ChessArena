When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King positions:\n- White king is on c4\n- Black king is on e5\n- Black king is more active and centralized\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n- White has passed pawns on a2 and c2\n- Black has pawns on a7, b6, c6\n- The b3 pawn is isolated\n\n4. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c4b4: Moves king towards queenside but away from center\n- c4d3: Moves king towards center but leaves a2 pawn vulnerable\n- c4c3: Moves king towards pawns but blocks b3 pawn\n- b3b4: Advances passed pawn but allows ...c5 to fix it\n- c2c3: Advances passed pawn and supports b3 pawn\n- a2a3: Prepares a4 but is slow\n- a2a4: Advances passed pawn immediately\n\nThe best move is c2c3 because:\n1. It advances a passed pawn\n2. Supports the b3 pawn\n3. Prepares to push a2-a4 later\n4. Keeps the king flexible to move to d3 or b3\n5. Doesn't allow Black to fix the pawn structure with ...c5\n\n```\nc2c3\n```"
