When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4 that's very dangerous\n- White's rook on c5 is active but could be trapped\n- Black's rook on e2 is very active and threatening\n- White's king is exposed and needs to find safety\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g2h3: Moves king towards center but exposes it to checks\n- g2g3: Keeps king more protected but doesn't address threats\n- g2f3: Moves king towards the passed d-pawn but exposes to rook checks\n- g2h1: Moves king to corner, safest option\n- g2g1: Similar to h1 but slightly more exposed\n- g2f1: Most exposed, allows ...Rf2+ winning the rook\n\n4. Best move is g2h1 because:\n- Gets the king to relative safety in the corner\n- Avoids any potential checks from Black's rook\n- Prepares to potentially bring the king towards the queenside to stop the d-pawn\n- All other moves either expose the king too much or allow tactical shots\n\n```\ng2h1\n```"
