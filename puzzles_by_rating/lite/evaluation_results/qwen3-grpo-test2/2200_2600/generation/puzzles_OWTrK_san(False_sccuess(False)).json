When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's bishop is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on c4\n- White's rook on f5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on g4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on e5 that could be pushed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5f8: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- f5f7: Rook moves away from action\n- f5f6: Rook stays active but doesn't accomplish much\n- f5g5: Attacks the g4 pawn, but Black can defend with ...Bf3\n- f5f4: Blocks the g4 pawn's advance, but allows ...Bf3\n- e5e6: Advances the passed pawn, but Black can play ...Bf3 attacking it\n\n4. Best move seems to be f5f4:\n- Stops Black's g4 pawn from advancing\n- Maintains rook activity\n- If Black plays ...Bf3, White can play e5e6 winning the bishop after Rxf3\n- If Black does nothing, White can push e5e6 next move\n\nThe move f5f4 is the most restrictive for Black while maintaining White's activity.\n\n```\nf5f4\n```"
