When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's queen on f2 is attacking White's bishop on g5\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by White's pawn on e4\n- White's bishop on g5 is pinning Black's pawn on f7 to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f2h4: Captures the bishop, but after Qxh4, Black's queen is exposed\n- f2f4: Attacks the e4 pawn, but allows Qxg5\n- e6f5: Breaks the pin by capturing the bishop, but allows Qxh5\n- f7f6: Breaks the pin but weakens the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be e6f5:\n- It removes the dangerous bishop\n- After Qxh5, Black can play Qxg5 winning the bishop\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play Qxg5 anyway\n- It maintains material equality while removing a key attacker\n\nOther moves either don't address the pin or allow White to maintain the initiative. e6f5 is the most forcing and best move.\n\n```\ne6f5\n```"
