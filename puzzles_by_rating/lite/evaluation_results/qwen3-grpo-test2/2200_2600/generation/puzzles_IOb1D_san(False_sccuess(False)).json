When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a bishop on f6 that's very active\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's knight on b6 is under pressure from White's pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8e8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- d8d7: Connects rooks but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- c8e6: Attacks the active bishop on f6\n- e7f5: Challenges the bishop and opens lines\n- b6d5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be b6d5:\n- Removes White's dangerous passed pawn\n- Opens the b-file for Black's rook\n- After Qxd5, Black can play ...c8e6 attacking the bishop\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play ...d5d4 gaining space\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or are too passive. Capturing the pawn is the most active and concrete way to improve Black's position.\n\n```\nb6d5\n```"
