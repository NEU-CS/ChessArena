When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's bishop on e5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White's queen is exposed on c3\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on f7\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f7f8: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n- f7e7: Centralizes king but exposes it to checks\n- f7f6: Keeps king more active\n- c6d5: Trades bishop for queen, but after Qxd5 Black's c-pawn is weak\n- c5d5: Captures queen but allows Qxe5+\n- c5c4: Advances passed pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d6d5: Opens lines for bishop but doesn't seem critical\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5d5:\n- It captures the queen for a pawn\n- After Qxe5+, Black can play Kf7 and the c-pawn is still dangerous\n- White's compensation is minimal as Black's bishop remains active\n\nThe most forcing and best move is to capture the queen immediately.\n\n```\nc5d5\n```"
