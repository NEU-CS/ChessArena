When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a rook on e4 and a queen on d7, while White has a rook on e1 and bishop on c5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on h3 that could be dangerous\n- Black's pawn on e5 is weak and could be a target\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5f8: Bishop checks the king, but Black can block with Qd7-f7\n- g3g6: Pushing the pawn to attack the weak e5 pawn\n- f3e5: Capturing the weak pawn immediately\n- e1e5: Rook takes the pawn with check\n\n4. Best move seems to be f3e5:\n- It wins a pawn immediately\n- After Bxe5, White can play Qg4+ winning the rook on e4\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure\n- It's a clean, forcing move that improves White's position\n\nOther moves like c5f8 or g3g6 are less direct and don't win material immediately. The pawn capture is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\nf3e5\n```"
