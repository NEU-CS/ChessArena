When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on c6 is very active\n- Black's queen on a2 is trapped and needs to escape\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on h3 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a2e6: Queen escape while attacking the bishop\n- a2d5: Queen escape while centralizing\n- a2f2: Queen escape while attacking the rook\n- e8e7: Rook move to defend the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be a2e6 because:\n- It escapes the pin on the a-file\n- It attacks White's bishop on b4\n- If White takes the queen (Qxe6), Black can play Bc5+ winning the rook on f3\n- It maintains material equality while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves like a2d5 or a2f2 don't address the immediate problem of the trapped queen as effectively. e8e7 is too passive.\n\n```\na2e6\n```"
