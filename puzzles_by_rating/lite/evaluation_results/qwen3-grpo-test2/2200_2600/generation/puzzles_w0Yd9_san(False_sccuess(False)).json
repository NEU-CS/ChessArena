When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White's king is on e4, Black's king on f6\n4. White has a pawn on e3\nCandidate moves:\n1. e4d5 - moves towards the black pawn but leaves e3 pawn undefended\n2. e4d4 - moves away from black king but doesn't make progress\n3. e4f3 - moves towards black pawn while protecting e3 pawn\n4. e4d3 - moves away from both pawns\nAnalysis:\n- e4d5 allows Black to play ...g4, fixing the pawn and making it harder to stop\n- e4d4 is too passive and doesn't address either pawn\n- e4f3 is best as it:\n  * Approaches the g5 pawn\n  * Protects the e3 pawn\n  * Limits Black king's movement\n  * Prepares to capture the g5 pawn if it advances\n- e4d3 moves away from both pawns and is too passive\nThe most active and precise move is e4f3, putting maximum pressure on Black's position while maintaining all defensive needs.\n```\ne4f3\n```"
