When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on h7\n- White's queen is very active on d5\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White has a passed pawn on h6\n- Black's bishop on e7 is blocked by its own pawn on f6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5g8: Queen check, but Black can block with Qe8\n- d5f7: Queen check, but Black can take with Qxf7\n- d5e6: Centralizing queen, attacking f6 pawn\n- f1f5: Rook lift, attacking f6 pawn\n- e3e4: Pushing passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5e6:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the f6 pawn which is Black's only real weakness\n- If Black takes queen with Qxe6, White can play f1f5 winning the f6 pawn\n- If Black moves king, White can play Qxf6 winning a pawn\n- If Black plays Qe8, White can play Qxf6 anyway\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish as much or allow Black to consolidate. d5e6 maintains maximum pressure while improving the queen's position.\n\n```\nd5e6\n```"
