When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's rook, pawn and king. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on e4\n- White's rook on h5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on h4 that could be dangerous\n- Black's rook on d3 is controlling the d-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- h5h6: Attacks the f6 pawn, but Black can defend\n- h5g5: Centralizes the rook and eyes the g-file\n- g2g3: Pushes the passed pawn but leaves it vulnerable\n- a2a4: Stops Black's passed pawn but weakens b3\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5g5 because:\n- Centralizes the rook\n- Prepares to double on the g-file if needed\n- Eyes the g4 pawn which is supporting Black's king\n- If Black plays ...Kf5, White can play Rg4+ winning the f5 pawn\n- Maintains flexibility to go after either side's pawns\n\nThe move h5g5 improves White's piece activity while maintaining all options.\n\n```\nh5g5\n```"
