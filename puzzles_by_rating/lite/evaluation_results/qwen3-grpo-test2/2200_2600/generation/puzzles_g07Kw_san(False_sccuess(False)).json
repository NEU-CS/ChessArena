When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's rook on b2 is very active and threatening\n- White's king is exposed on f3\n- Black's king is relatively safe on e6\n- White has passed pawns on g4 and h4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2b8: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- b2b7: Attacks the a7 rook, but White can just move it\n- b2h2: Checks the king, but White can take the rook\n- e6d5: King moves towards center, but doesn't accomplish much\n- h6h5: Pushes pawn, but doesn't create threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be b2b3:\n- Attacks the f3 king directly\n- If king moves, Black can play b3f3 winning the g4 pawn\n- If White takes the rook (Kf3b3), Black can play h6h5 creating a passed pawn\n- Maintains all options for the rook\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow White to consolidate. b2b3 is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for White.\n\n```\nb2b3\n```"
