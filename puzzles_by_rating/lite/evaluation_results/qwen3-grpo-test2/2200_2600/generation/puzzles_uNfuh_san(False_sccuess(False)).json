When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen and pawns vs Black's queen and pawns. Material is equal, but White's queen is more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White's queen is very active on h8\n- Black has a passed pawn on f4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on c4 that's not yet advanced\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g7: Checks the king and attacks the f6 pawn\n- h8e5: Centralizes the queen and attacks the f4 pawn\n- f3g4: Captures the dangerous f4 pawn\n- e4e5: Advances the central pawn\n\n4. Evaluating the best move:\n- h8g7+ forces the king to move (only legal response is Kf7-e7)\n- After Ke7, White can play Qg7-f6+ winning the h6 pawn\n- Black's f4 pawn is still dangerous, but White can handle it\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate threats or miss opportunities\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is h8g7+, which leads to winning material while maintaining the initiative. \n\n```\nh8g7\n```"
