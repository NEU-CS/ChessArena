When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's bishop on d6 is very active\n- White's rook on h3 is awkwardly placed\n- Black's king is slightly exposed on g8\n- White's king is on g2 with potential threats from Black's bishop\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e5: Centralizing the bishop and attacking the d4 pawn\n- d6f4: Attacking the h3 rook and controlling important squares\n- b5e2: Winning the exchange by capturing the bishop\n- c8c4: Activating the rook and putting pressure on the 4th rank\n\n4. Best move seems to be b5e2:\n- It wins the bishop for a rook (exchange win)\n- After Bxe2, Black can play Rxe2 with a clear material advantage\n- White can't prevent this as the bishop has no safe squares\n- Even if White tries to defend with moves like Rh2, Black still wins the bishop\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow White to maintain the balance. The exchange win is the most forcing and decisive move in this position.\n\n```\nb5e2\n```"
