When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and queen vs Black's rook and queen. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on d5 which could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White's knight on c7 is very active\n- Black's queen on c3 is threatening White's pawn on a4\n- White's rook on f6 is controlling the 6th rank\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7e8: Knight check, but Black can block with rook\n- c7a6: Attacks the queen while maintaining pressure\n- f6f7: Rook moves to 7th rank, but doesn't accomplish much\n- b6b7: Pushes the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n- a4a5: Pushes the pawn to protect it from the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be c7a6:\n- It attacks Black's queen\n- If queen moves, White can play b6b7 pushing the passed pawn\n- If queen takes a6, then b6b7 is very strong as the pawn is protected by the knight\n- It maintains all of White's threats while forcing Black to react\n\nOther moves either don't address the queen threat or don't maximize White's active pieces. c7a6 is the most forcing and maintains the initiative.\n\n```\nc7a6\n```"
