When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a queen on g7 attacking Black's rook on f8\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White has a rook on f6 controlling the f-file\n- Black has a knight on e5 that's very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8h8: Moves the rook away from attack but seems passive\n- e5d7: Centralizes the knight and defends the rook\n- e5g6: Attacks the queen but allows Qxg6\n- c7d7: Blocks the queen's attack on the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5d7 because:\n- It defends the rook on f8\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- After Qxf8, Black can play Nc6 attacking the rook\n- It's more active than moving the rook itself\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or are too passive. e5d7 is the most active and defensive move.\n\n```\ne5d7\n```"
