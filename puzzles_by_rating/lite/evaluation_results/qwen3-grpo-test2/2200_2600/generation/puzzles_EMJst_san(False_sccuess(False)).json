When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop, pawns and a rook vs White's queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on c6 is very active\n- Black's rook on e2 is attacking the g2 bishop\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2e6: Rook takes bishop, but Qxe6 wins the exchange\n- e2e4: Rook checks, but White can block with Bf3\n- c4a6: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n- c4d3: Centralizing the pawn, but doesn't create threats\n- g7h6: Moving the bishop to safety while maintaining pressure\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2e4+:\n- It's a check that forces White to respond\n- After Bf3, Black can play c4d3, centralizing the pawn\n- If White doesn't block, Black can play e4e3+ winning the bishop\n- It maintains the initiative and keeps pieces active\n\nThe move e2e4+ creates immediate problems for White while maintaining Black's active piece play.\n\n```\ne2e4\n```"
