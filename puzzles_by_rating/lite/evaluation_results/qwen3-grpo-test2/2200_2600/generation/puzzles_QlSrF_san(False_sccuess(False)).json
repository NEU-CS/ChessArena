When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is more active on d5\n- White's king is on e3, which is slightly exposed\n- Black has a passed pawn on f4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could be advanced\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- d3c3: Moves king towards center but away from pawns\n- d3e2: Moves king towards pawns but exposes to checks\n- d3d2: Moves king backwards, not helpful\n- d3c2: Moves king towards corner, not ideal\n- e3e4: Centralizes king and blocks Black's f4 pawn\n\n4. Best move is e3e4 because:\n- It centralizes the king\n- Blocks Black's dangerous passed pawn on f4\n- Prepares to support White's own passed pawn on d4\n- Maintains flexibility to go to d5 or f4 next move\n- Doesn't expose the king to any checks\n\nThe other moves either don't improve the position or move the king to less active squares.\n\n```\ne3e4\n```"
