When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King positions:\n- White king is on f2\n- Black king is on f4\n- Black king is more active and closer to White's pawns\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n- White's a3 pawn is blocked by Black's a6 pawn\n- White's b4 pawn is blocked by Black's b5 pawn\n- White's h2 pawn is free to move\n- Black's g5 pawn is advanced but can be captured by h2h4\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f2g2: Moves king towards center but doesn't accomplish much\n- f2e2: Moves king towards queenside pawns\n- f2g1/f2f1/f2e1: Retreating king seems passive\n- a3a4: Pushes pawn but Black can capture with b5a4\n- h2h3: Prepares h4 but slow\n- h2h4: Immediately challenges Black's advanced pawn\n\nThe best move is h2h4 because:\n1) It challenges Black's advanced g5 pawn\n2) After g5g4, White can play h4g3 opening lines for the king\n3) It prevents Black from playing g5g4 without consequence\n4) It's the most active move that creates counterplay\n\n```\nh2h4\n```"
