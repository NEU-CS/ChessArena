When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's bishop and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on e4\n- White's bishop is very active on f6\n- Black has a passed pawn on c6\n- White has a passed pawn on a3\n- Black's bishop on d1 is controlling the long diagonal\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6h8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- f6d8: Similar to h8, not improving position\n- f6g7: Attacks the h5 pawn, but allows Black to push c5\n- f6e7: Centralizes bishop but doesn't create threats\n- f6g5: Most active, attacking h5 pawn and keeping pressure\n- h4g5: King moves towards center but exposes to checks\n- a3a4: Pushes passed pawn but slow\n- g2g3/g4: Doesn't address immediate concerns\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6g5 because:\n- Attacks the h5 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n- If Black takes the bishop (h5xg5), White can play a3a4 creating a passed pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with h4g5 centralizing the king\n\nThe move f6g5 creates the most problems for Black while maintaining White's active piece play.\n\n```\nf6g5\n```"
