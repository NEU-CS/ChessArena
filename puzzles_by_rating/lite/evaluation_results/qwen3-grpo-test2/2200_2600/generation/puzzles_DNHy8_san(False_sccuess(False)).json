When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and knight vs White's knight and bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on d8\n- White has a passed pawn on b4\n- Black has a knight on g4 attacking f2\n- White's queen on c3 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e7 is blocked by its own pawn on f6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- g4d7: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n- f4g6: Moves the knight to a safer square while maintaining pressure\n- e7d6: Develops the bishop and opens lines\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4d7 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks White's active queen on c3\n- If White moves the queen, Black can play f4g6 next, improving the knight\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n- It's more active than other options\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or leave pieces vulnerable. g4d7 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\ng4d7\n```"
