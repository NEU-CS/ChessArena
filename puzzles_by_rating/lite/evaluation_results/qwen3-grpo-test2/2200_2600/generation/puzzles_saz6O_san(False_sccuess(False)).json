When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, queen, pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on b4 is very active\n- White's rook on e5 is under attack by Black's bishop on e6\n- White's queen on f4 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on d7\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5e6: Captures the bishop but allows Qxe6 winning the rook\n- f4f7: Checks the king, but Black can block with Rf8\n- f4h6: Attacks the g7 pawn but doesn't accomplish much\n- c1c8: Checks the king, but Black can take the rook with Qxc8\n- e5h5: Moves the rook to safety while maintaining pressure\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5h5:\n- Gets the rook out of attack\n- Maintains pressure on the h-file\n- Keeps options open for Qf7+ next move\n- Doesn't allow any immediate counterplay\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't improve White's position. e5h5 is the most solid choice.\n\n```\ne5h5\n```"
