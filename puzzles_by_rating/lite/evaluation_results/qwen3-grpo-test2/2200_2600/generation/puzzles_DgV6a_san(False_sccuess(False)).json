When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawns vs White's knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's bishop is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on f4\n- Black's bishop on g4 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n- White has a knight on c5 that's controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4f5: Bishop takes pawn, but allows White's king to capture the bishop\n- g4h3: Bishop checks the king, but White can just move away\n- g4f3: Bishop checks the king, forcing it to move\n- c7d6: King moves towards the center\n- d5d4: Pushes the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4f3:\n- It's a check that forces White's king to move\n- After Kf4-e3 (best response), Black can play d5d4 pushing the passed pawn\n- If White plays Kf4-e5, Black can play Bf3-e2+ winning the b3 pawn\n- It maintains Black's active bishop while putting pressure on White's king\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow White to consolidate. The check is most forcing and creates immediate problems for White.\n\n```\ng4f3\n```"
