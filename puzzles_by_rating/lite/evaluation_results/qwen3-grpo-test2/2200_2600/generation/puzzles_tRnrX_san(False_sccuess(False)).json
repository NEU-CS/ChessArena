When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on f5\n- White's queen on h5 is exposed but attacking\n- Black's knight on d5 is strong\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h8: Queen check, but Black can block with rook\n- h5f7: Queen takes pawn with check, but Black can play Qxf7\n- e4e6: Rook moves to attack the knight, but Black can play Qxe6\n- d1d5: Rook takes knight, but Black can play Qxd5\n- h5g6: Queen moves to safe square while maintaining pressure\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5g6:\n- Gets the queen to safety\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n- Keeps options open for future attacks\n- Doesn't allow Black any counterplay\n- After Qg6, Black has no good moves - if ...Qxg6 then Rxe6 wins material\n\nOther moves either allow Black counterplay or don't improve White's position as much. h5g6 is the most precise move.\n\n```\nh5g6\n```"
