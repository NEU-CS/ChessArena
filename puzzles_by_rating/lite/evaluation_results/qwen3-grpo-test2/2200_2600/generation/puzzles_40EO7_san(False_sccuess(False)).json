When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, bishop and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on b2, attacking the h2 pawn\n- White's king is exposed on g2\n- Black's bishop on c6 is controlling important squares\n- White's bishop on h3 is blocked by its own pawn on g3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h3c8: Bishop takes rook, but Black can just take our bishop with b7c8\n- h3e6: Centralizes bishop and attacks Black's bishop\n- f1f7: Queen moves to attack Black's pawn on f7\n- a4a5: Advances passed pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g3g4: Creates luft but weakens pawn structure\n\n4. Best move seems to be h3e6 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks Black's bishop on c6\n- If Black takes our bishop (b7e6), we can play Qf7+ winning the f7 pawn\n- If Black moves their bishop, we gain time to defend h2 pawn\n- It's the most active move that improves our position\n\n```\nh3e6\n```"
