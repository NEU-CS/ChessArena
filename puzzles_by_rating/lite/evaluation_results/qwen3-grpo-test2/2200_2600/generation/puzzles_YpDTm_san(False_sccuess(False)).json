When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's king is on d6, Black's king on h6\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n- White has a passed pawn on a6\n- Black's rook is on c2, White's rook on a3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6g7: King moves towards center but away from action\n- h6h5: King moves towards pawn but exposes to checks\n- c2c8: Rook moves to back rank but doesn't accomplish much\n- d4d3: Pushes passed pawn but allows White to capture it\n- c2a2: Rook checks the king, forcing it to move\n\n4. Best move seems to be c2a2+:\n- It's a check that forces White's king to move\n- After Kd6-e7 (only legal move), Black can play d4d3 pushing the passed pawn\n- This creates a race where Black's d-pawn may promote before White's a-pawn\n- Even if White captures the d-pawn, Black can capture the a-pawn with the rook\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish anything or allow White to consolidate. The check is the most forcing move.\n\n```\nc2a2\n```"
