Candidate moves analysis:\n- b1c2: Moves king towards center but doesn't address the a3 pawn threat\n- b1a2: Moves king to attack the a3 pawn directly\n- e5e6: Advances the passed pawn but leaves a3 pawn unchecked\n- g3g4: Advances pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move is b1a2 because:\n- It directly attacks the dangerous a3 pawn\n- If Black pushes a3a2, White can capture it with Kxa2\n- It brings the king closer to the action\n- Other moves either don't address the a3 pawn or are too passive\n\nThe immediate threat is the a3 pawn, so we must deal with that first. b1a2 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nb1a2\n```"
