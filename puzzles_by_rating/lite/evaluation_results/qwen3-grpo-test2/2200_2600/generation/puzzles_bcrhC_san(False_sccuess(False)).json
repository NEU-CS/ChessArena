When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, pawns vs White's rook, knight, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a knight on f8 that's very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a queen on a4 attacking the e8 square\n- Black has a knight on e2 that's very active\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on e4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2f4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n- e2d4: Attacks the queen and controls more squares\n- e6f5: Moves the bishop to a more active diagonal\n- d8d7: Connects rooks and prepares to defend the king\n\n4. Threats:\n- White could play Qe8+ winning the rook\n- White could play Nxe4 winning a pawn\n- White could play Qb3+ winning the knight\n\nAfter considering these factors, e2f4 seems strongest because:\n- It attacks the queen\n- It defends the e4 pawn\n- It prepares to jump to g2 or d3\n- It maintains control of key squares\n- It doesn't allow any immediate tactics for White\n\nThe move e2f4 addresses multiple concerns while improving Black's position.\n\n```\ne2f4\n```"
