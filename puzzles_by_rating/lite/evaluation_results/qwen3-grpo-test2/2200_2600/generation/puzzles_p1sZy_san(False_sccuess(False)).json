When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, bishop and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on e7 is very active\n- Black's bishop on f6 is controlling important squares\n- White's queen on a3 is not very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on h5 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is exposed on f4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e4: Centralizing the rook and attacking the queen\n- f6e5: Centralizing the bishop and attacking the king\n- c2c4: Moving the rook to attack the queen\n- h5h4: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7e4:\n- It centralizes the rook\n- Attacks the queen on a3\n- If queen moves, Black can play f6e5+ winning the bishop\n- If queen takes rook (Qxe4), then f6e5+ wins the bishop\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving piece activity\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position as much or allow White to consolidate. e7e4 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\ne7e4\n```"
