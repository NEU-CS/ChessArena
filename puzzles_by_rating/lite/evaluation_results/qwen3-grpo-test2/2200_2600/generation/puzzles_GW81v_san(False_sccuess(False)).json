When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on h6 is very active\n- White's knight on d6 is well placed but potentially trapped\n- Black's king is exposed in the center\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has a knight on e5 controlling important squares\n\n3. Looking at the legal king moves:\n- e8f8: Moves towards the corner, but might be safer\n- e8d8: Moves away from the center but towards the queenside\n- e8e7: Moves down the e-file, but still exposed\n- e8d7: Moves towards the center but might be dangerous\n\n4. Best move considerations:\n- e8d7 seems most active, centralizing the king and preparing to potentially support the e5 knight\n- It also avoids potential checks along the e-file\n- The king can still escape to c7 if needed\n- It's more active than moving to the corner (f8)\n\nAfter considering all options, e8d7 seems like the most active and safest king move, improving the king's position while maintaining flexibility.\n\n```\ne8d7\n```"
