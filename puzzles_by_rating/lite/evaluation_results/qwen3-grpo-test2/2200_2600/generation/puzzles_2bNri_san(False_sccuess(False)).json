When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on f6\n- White's bishop on g3 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White has a potential passed pawn on b3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3b8: Bishop takes rook - but after ...Kxb8, Black's king becomes more active\n- g3e5: Centralizes bishop and attacks the knight\n- e1e4: Centralizes rook and prepares to double on the e-file\n- b3b4: Advances passed pawn but may be premature\n\n4. Best move seems to be g3e5 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks the knight on f5\n- If Black moves the knight, we can play e1e4 increasing pressure\n- If Black takes the bishop (f5e5), we can play e1e4 with a strong centralized rook\n- Maintains all our options while improving our piece\n\nOther moves either don't improve our pieces or allow Black to consolidate. g3e5 is the most active and flexible move.\n\n```\ng3e5\n```"
