When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black's bishop is more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on e5\n- White's knight on b3 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on d3 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on b5\n- Black's bishop on b6 is controlling the long diagonal\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b3c5: Attacks the e5 king and controls important squares\n- b3d4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the d3 pawn\n- d1d2: Moves the king towards the center\n- g4g5: Advances the pawn but doesn't seem critical\n\n4. Best move seems to be b3c5 because:\n- It directly attacks the black king\n- If Black moves the king, we can capture the d3 pawn\n- If Black plays ...Kd6, we can play Nc5xd3 winning a pawn\n- It maintains control of key squares\n- It prevents Black from playing ...d2 which would promote the pawn\n\nThe move b3c5 puts maximum pressure on Black's position while maintaining our own pawn structure.\n\n```\nb3c5\n```"
