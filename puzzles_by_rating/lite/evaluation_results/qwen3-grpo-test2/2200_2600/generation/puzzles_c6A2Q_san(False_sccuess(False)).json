When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawns vs White's pawns. Black is up a bishop, which is a significant advantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on c7 that's very dangerous\n- Black's king is active and can help stop the pawn\n- Black's bishop is controlling important squares\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7e8: Bishop moves to e8, but doesn't accomplish much\n- d7c8: Bishop moves to c8, but again not active\n- d7e6: Bishop moves to e6, attacking the c7 pawn\n- d7c6: Bishop moves to c6, blocking the c7 pawn\n- d7b5: Bishop moves to b5, but doesn't help\n- d7a4: Bishop moves to a4, too far\n- f5f6: King moves forward, but not necessary\n- f5e6: King moves towards the pawn\n- f5f4: King moves away from action\n- f5e4: King moves towards center\n\n4. Best move is d7c6:\n- It directly blocks the dangerous c7 pawn\n- If White takes the bishop (Pxc6), Black can play Kf6 and stop the pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can maintain the blockade\n- It's the most active and purposeful move\n\n```\nd7c6\n```"
