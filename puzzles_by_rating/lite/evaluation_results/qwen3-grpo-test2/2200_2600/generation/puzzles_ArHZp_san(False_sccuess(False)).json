When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on c4\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- Black has a knight on g5 attacking f3\n- Black has a bishop on d4 controlling important squares\n- White has a passed pawn on b7 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- g5f3: Captures the bishop, but after Qxf3 Black's position remains difficult\n- d4e3: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the queen\n- g3c7: Attacks the passed pawn on b7\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4e3:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks the queen which has to move\n- After Q moves, Black can play g5f3 winning the bishop\n- It maintains pressure while improving piece placement\n- It prevents any counterplay from White's queen\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to consolidate. d4e3 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nd4e3\n```"
