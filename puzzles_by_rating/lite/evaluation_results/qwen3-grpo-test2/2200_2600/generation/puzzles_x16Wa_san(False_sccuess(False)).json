When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on d6\n- White's rook on c5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on e5\n- White has potential passed pawns on b4 and c3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5c6: Attacks the b7 pawn and threatens to win material\n- c5e5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n- c5d5: Checks the king, but Black can just take the rook\n- b4b5: Advances the passed pawn\n- c3c4: Advances the other passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5e5:\n- It captures the dangerous passed pawn\n- After ...dxe5, White can play b4b5 creating a passed pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can just take the pawn next move\n- It's more forcing than other options\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat of the e5 pawn or don't maximize White's active rook.\n\n```\nc5e5\n```"
