When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and queen vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a queen on c3 attacking White's pawn on d3\n- White's king is exposed on d5\n- Black's bishop on g5 is very active\n- White's queen on c5 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d5e6: Moves king away from center but exposes it to checks\n- d5c6: Moves king towards queenside but still leaves it exposed\n- d5e5: Keeps king more central but still vulnerable\n- d5e4: Moves king towards black's pieces, dangerous\n- c5d6: Blocks the queen's attack on d3 but allows ...Bf4+\n- b5d7: Moves bishop to defend d3 pawn and control important squares\n\n4. Best move is b5d7 because:\n- Defends the d3 pawn from the queen\n- Controls the e6 square, preventing ...Bf4+ \n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n- Keeps all other pieces active\n- Doesn't expose the king further\n\nThe move b5d7 solves the immediate problem of the queen attack while maintaining piece activity and king safety.\n\n```\nb5d7\n```"
