When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's king is more active (b5 vs b7)\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's king is blocked by its own pawn on g5\n- White's pawns on g3 and h3 are potential passed pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5a6: Moves king towards black's pawns but away from our own\n- b5c5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn - this seems very strong\n- b7b8q: Promotes the pawn but it's not immediately useful\n- d5d6: Advances the passed pawn but allows black to capture it\n- h3h4: Advances the pawn but doesn't address the immediate threat\n\n4. The most critical move is b5c5, capturing the dangerous passed pawn on c5. This:\n- Eliminates black's most advanced pawn\n- Opens the c-file for our king to potentially support our own passed pawn\n- Prevents black from creating a passed pawn on the c-file\n- Maintains our king's active position\n\nAll other moves either don't address the immediate threat or are less precise. The capture is forced and beneficial.\n\n```\nb5c5\n```"
