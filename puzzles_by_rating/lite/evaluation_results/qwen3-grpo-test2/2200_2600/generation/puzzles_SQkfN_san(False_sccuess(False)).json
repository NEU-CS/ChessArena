When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop, pawns. Black is up a knight but White has some compensation with the active bishop pair.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on e1\n- White's queen on a5 is unprotected\n- Black's knight on h6 is threatening to jump to f5\n- White's king is exposed on g2\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e1e4: Centralizing the queen and attacking the bishop on c4\n- e1e3: Attacking the f2 pawn and keeping pressure\n- h6f5: Bringing the knight into the attack\n- c3c2: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1e4:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the bishop on c4\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play h6f5+ winning material\n- If White doesn't move the bishop, Black can play e4d3 winning the pawn on c3\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the key features or miss the opportunity to win material.\n\n```\ne1e4\n```"
