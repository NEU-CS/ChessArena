When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on g4 that's close to promotion\n- White's rook is active but not controlling the g-file\n- Black's knight is controlling important squares near White's king\n- Black's king is very active and close to White's king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a3a8: Rook moves to back rank but doesn't address immediate threats\n- a3f3: Attacks the g4 pawn but allows ...Nf2+ winning the rook\n- a3e3: Centralizes rook but doesn't stop pawn\n- f1f2: Moves king towards center but allows ...g3\n- f1e1: Moves king away from checks but doesn't address pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be a3f3:\n- It attacks the dangerous g4 pawn\n- After ...g3, White can play Rf4 stopping the pawn\n- If Black doesn't take the rook with ...Nf2+, White can play Rf4 anyway\n- It's the most active move that addresses the main threat\n\nThe move a3f3 puts maximum pressure on Black's position while maintaining material equality.\n\n```\na3f3\n```"
