When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, queen and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, pawns and king. Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a rook on e3 threatening to capture the f2 pawn\n- White's queen on c7 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's rook on d8 is controlling the 8th rank\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h8: Rook moves to h8, but doesn't accomplish much\n- c7c8: Queen moves to c8, but allows Black's rook to capture f2\n- c7e5: Queen checks the king, but Black can block with f7\n- c7f4: Queen attacks the rook on e3, but Black can just move it\n\n4. Best move seems to be c7e5+:\n- It's a check that forces Black to respond\n- After Kf7 (only legal move), White can play Qxe3 winning the rook\n- Even if Black tries Kh6, White can still win the rook next move\n- It maintains White's active piece play while addressing the immediate threat to f2\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous move in the position.\n\n```\nc7e5\n```"
