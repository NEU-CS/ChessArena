When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is on d5, White's on e3\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black has pawns on a5 and b5\n- White has a pawn on b3 that could be advanced\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e3f4: Moves king towards center but away from both pawns\n- e3f3: Similar to f4, not improving position\n- e3d3: Moves king towards black pawns but may be too slow\n- e3f2: Retreats king, not helpful\n- e3e2: Same as f2\n- e3d2: Moves king away from action\n- e5e6: Advances passed pawn, but black can respond with Kd5-e6\n- b3b4: Advances pawn, creating a passed pawn and fixing black's a-pawn\n4. Best move is b3b4 because:\n- Creates a passed pawn on b4\n- Fixes black's a-pawn (can't advance without losing)\n- Opens the a-file for potential rook lift (though no rooks are present)\n- Black's king is too far to stop both passed pawns\n- After b4, white can push e5-e6 creating two passed pawns\nThe move b3b4 is the most active and creates long-term winning chances by creating passed pawns.\n```\nb3b4\n```"
