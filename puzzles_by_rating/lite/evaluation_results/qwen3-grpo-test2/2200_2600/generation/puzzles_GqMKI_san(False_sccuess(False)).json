When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on g4 is very active\n- Black's queen on b6 is somewhat exposed\n- White's knight on f5 is threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on d3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- b6e3: Captures the dangerous knight, but after Qxe3 Black's queen is exposed\n- b6d4: Centralizes the queen and attacks the d3 pawn\n- c7h2: Checks the king, but White can just take the rook\n- b6f2: Attacks the queen while defending the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be b6e3:\n- It removes the dangerous knight\n- After Qxe3, Black can play Qxe3 winning the exchange (rook for queen)\n- White's queen would be very exposed after this sequence\n- It's the most forcing move in the position\n\nThe move b6e3 solves the most pressing problem (the knight) while creating counterplay.\n\n```\nb6e3\n```"
