When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on g6\n- White's queen is on h5, attacking the f7 pawn\n- Black's king is on f7, exposed\n- White's king is on f2, relatively safe\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h8: Queen retreat, but seems passive\n- h5h7: Attacks the king, but allows Qxh7\n- h5g6: Captures the active black queen! This seems very strong\n- h5f5: Centralizes queen but doesn't address threats\n- b4b5: Pushes pawn but doesn't seem critical\n\n4. After h5g6:\n- If Qxg6, then Qxg6 and White wins the queen\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure\n- Black has no good way to defend the queen\n\n5. Other moves either don't address the active black queen or are too passive. Capturing the queen is the most forcing and decisive move.\n\nThe best move is clearly to capture the black queen:\n\n```\nh5g6\n```"
