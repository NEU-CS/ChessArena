When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's h-pawn is advanced but not yet threatening to promote\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n- Black's king is active and close to White's king\n- White's bishop is currently blocked by its own king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2f3: Moves king towards center but exposes it to checks\n- e2e3: Keeps king more protected but doesn't improve position\n- g1d4: Bishop moves to active diagonal, controlling h8 square\n- g1e3: Bishop moves to defend king while maintaining control\n\n4. Best move seems to be g1d4 because:\n- It activates the bishop towards the h8 square where Black's pawn is\n- Controls the diagonal that would allow Black's king to approach\n- Maintains flexibility for the king\n- Prevents any potential checks from Black's king\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position or expose the king unnecessarily. The bishop move is most active and useful in this endgame.\n\n```\ng1d4\n```"
