When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. White is down significant material.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a rook on f4 attacking White's knight on f3\n- Black's queen on b6 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's bishop on g7 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g5: Moves knight away from attack but exposes it to queen\n- f3e5: Centralizes knight but still in rook's line\n- e2e4: Blocks rook but allows Qe3+ winning the knight\n- c1c4: Develops rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g1h2: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2e4:\n- Blocks the rook's attack on the knight\n- If Black takes e.p. (f4e4), White can play Nxe4 winning the pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains control of key squares\n- It's the most active move that addresses the immediate threat\n\nOther moves either don't solve the problem or create new weaknesses. e2e4 is the most forcing and active response.\n\n```\ne2e4\n```"
