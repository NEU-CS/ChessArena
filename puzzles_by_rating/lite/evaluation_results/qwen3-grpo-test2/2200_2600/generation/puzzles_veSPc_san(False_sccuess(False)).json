When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and bishop.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on b4\n- White's knight on c4 is pinned to the queen on d3\n- Black's bishop on d7 is blocked by its own pawn on d6\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b4d2: Queen takes pawn, but White can play Qxd2\n- b4e1: Queen checks, but White can block with Qe1\n- b4c3: Queen takes knight, but White can play Qxc3\n- b4a4: Queen moves to a safe square while maintaining pressure\n- d7e6: Bishop moves to open diagonal\n\n4. Best move seems to be b4c3:\n- It wins a knight for a queen (material gain)\n- After Qxc3, Black can play Bxe6 winning another pawn\n- White's queen becomes overloaded defending both the rook and pawns\n- Black maintains active piece play\n\nThe move b4c3 is the most forcing and wins material while maintaining Black's active piece play.\n\n```\nb4c3\n```"
