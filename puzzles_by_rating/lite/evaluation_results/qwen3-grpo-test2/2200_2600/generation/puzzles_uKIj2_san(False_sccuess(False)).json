When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

However, Black's queen is very active on a4.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's queen on a4 is very active\n- Black's knight on d5 is centralized\n- White's bishop on g5 is pinning the f6 pawn to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a4d7: Centralizing the queen and attacking the bishop on d7\n- a4c4: Attacking the bishop on d3\n- d5f4: Centralizing the knight and attacking the bishop on g5\n- e8g8: Castling to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5f4:\n- It attacks the pinned bishop on g5\n- If White takes the knight (Bxf4), Black can play Qxd3 winning a pawn\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play Qxd3 winning a pawn\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n\nOther moves like a4d7 or a4c4 don't address the pin as effectively, and castling (e8g8) is too passive.\n\n```\nd5f4\n```"
