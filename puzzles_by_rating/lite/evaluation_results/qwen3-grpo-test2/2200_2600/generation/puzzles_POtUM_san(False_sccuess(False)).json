When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and rook vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a bishop on g4 pinning White's knight on f4 to the queen\n- White has a rook on g3 attacking the pinned bishop\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black has a pawn on h4 that could be weak\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4g6: Captures the bishop but allows Black to play Qxg6\n- f1h3: Attacks the pinned bishop while maintaining the pin\n- d1g4: Captures the bishop directly\n- e5e6: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d1g4:\n- It wins the bishop immediately as Black can't take back (Qxg4 allows Rg3xg4 winning material)\n- After Qxg4, White can play Rg3xg4 winning the bishop\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White maintains the pin and can increase pressure\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow Black to maintain the pin. d1g4 is the most forcing and wins material.\n\n```\nd1g4\n```"
