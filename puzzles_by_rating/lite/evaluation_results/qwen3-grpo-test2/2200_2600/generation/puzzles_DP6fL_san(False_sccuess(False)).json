When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a king and 3 pawns vs Black's king and 4 pawns. Material is equal, but Black has more pawns which could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's king is more active (d5 vs Black's f5)\n- Black has connected passed pawns on the g and h files\n- White has a passed pawn on b4\n- Black's a-pawn is isolated but advanced\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5d6: Centralizes king but allows Black to push g4-g3\n- d5c6: Moves king towards queenside but away from Black's advancing pawns\n- d5c5: Keeps king central and prepares to stop Black's pawns\n- d5d4: Moves king forward but doesn't address pawn threats\n- h3h4: Stops g4-g3 but weakens g3\n- g3g4: Pushes pawn but allows Black's king to penetrate\n- a2a3/a2a4: Advances pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5c5:\n- Prepares to stop Black's g and h pawns by moving towards f5\n- Maintains flexibility to go after Black's a-pawn if needed\n- Doesn't allow Black to make progress with pawn pushes\n- Keeps options open for both central and queenside play\n\nThe move d5c5 is the most flexible and positional, maintaining control over the critical squares while preventing Black's pawn advances.\n\n```\nd5c5\n```"
