When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has pawns on b4, c5, f5, g3, h3.\n\n2. King positions:\n- Black king is on f7\n- White king is on d4\nWhite's king is more active and centralized.\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n- Black has isolated pawns on a6 and b7\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's h6 pawn is weak and could be targeted\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: Moves king towards corner, not helpful\n- f7f8: Same as above\n- f7e8: Moves king away from action\n- f7e7: Centralizes king, good\n- g7g6: Creates luft but weakens pawn structure\n- b7b6: Could help connect pawns\n- h6h5: Pushes weak pawn\n- a6a5: Pushes isolated pawn\n- g7g5: Creates passed pawn but weakens king\n- b7b5: Aggressive but may open lines\n\nBest move seems to be f7e7, centralizing the king and preparing to:\n1) Support the f6 pawn\n2) Potentially move to d6 to stop white's c-pawn\n3) Be ready to help advance black's own pawns\n\nThe other moves either don't improve the position or create weaknesses.\n\n```\nf7e7\n```"
