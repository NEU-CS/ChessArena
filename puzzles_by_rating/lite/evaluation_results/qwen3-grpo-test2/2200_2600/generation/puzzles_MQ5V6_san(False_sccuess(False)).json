When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on b7 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's king is on c3, somewhat exposed\n- Black's bishop on a6 is blocked by its own pawn on d6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c8e7: Blocks the rook's file but leaves the bishop passive\n- a6b5: Attacks the rook but allows Rb7b5+\n- d7d6: Opens the bishop's diagonal but weakens e6\n- g7h7: Moves the king to safety but passively\n\n4. Best move seems to be a6b5:\n- Attacks the active rook on b7\n- If Rb7b5+, Black can play Kf7 and the rook has to move\n- After Rb7b5, Black can play Bb5c4 attacking the e2 pawn\n- This maintains piece activity while dealing with White's threats\n\nOther moves either don't address the active rook or create new weaknesses. a6b5 is the most active and challenging response.\n\n```\na6b5\n```"
