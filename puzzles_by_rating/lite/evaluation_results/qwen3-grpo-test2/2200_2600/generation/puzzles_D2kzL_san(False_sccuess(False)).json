When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White has connected passed pawns on d4 and h5\n- Black's rook is active on g4, attacking the h5 pawn\n- Black's king is on f7, White's king on c5\n- White's rook on f5 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4g6: Attacks the h5 pawn but allows White to push d5\n- g4g5: Pins the h5 pawn to the king, but White can play Rf5g5\n- g4h4: Attacks the h5 pawn directly\n- f7e6: Centralizes the king but may be too slow\n- g7g6: Creates luft but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4h4:\n- Directly attacks the h5 pawn\n- If White defends with Rf5h5, Black can play Rh4h5 winning a pawn\n- If White pushes h6, Black can play Rh4h6 winning the pawn\n- Maintains pressure while keeping options open\n\nOther moves either don't address the h5 pawn or allow White to advance their pawns. g4h4 is the most forcing move.\n\n```\ng4h4\n```"
