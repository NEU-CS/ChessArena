When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on b3 that's very dangerous\n- White's king is exposed\n- Black's rook on c3 is very active\n- White's bishop on f6 is strong but potentially trapped\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6h8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- c7e6: Knight moves to attack the b3 pawn\n- d2d3: Rook moves to block the b3 pawn's advance\n- f1g2: King moves to safer square\n\n4. Critical threats:\n- Black can play b3b2 next move, promoting the pawn\n- Black can play Rc3c2+ winning the h3 pawn\n\nAfter considering these factors, d2d3 seems most important as it:\n- Blocks the dangerous passed pawn\n- Maintains control of the position\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics from Black\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or allow Black to create threats. The bishop can always retreat later if needed.\n\n```\nd2d3\n```"
