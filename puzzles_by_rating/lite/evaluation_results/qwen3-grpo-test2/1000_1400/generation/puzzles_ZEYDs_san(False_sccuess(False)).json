When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's bishop is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is on c7, White's king on b5\n- Black has a knight on e4 controlling important squares\n- White has a passed pawn on a5 that could be dangerous\n- Black has pawns on e5 and g5 that could advance\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: Bishop moves to corner, not very active\n- f7e6: Bishop checks the king, but king can take the bishop\n- b5a6: King moves away from center, not helpful\n- a5a6: Advances the passed pawn, but allows ...e4d2 winning the pawn\n- g3g4: Stops ...g5g4, but doesn't address other issues\n\n4. Best move seems to be b5c4:\n- Centralizes the king\n- Attacks the knight on e4\n- If Black moves knight, White can push a5a6\n- If Black plays ...e4d2, White can play Bf7d5 winning the pawn\n\nThe move b5c4 improves White's king position while putting pressure on Black's knight. It's the most active and purposeful move in the position.\n\n```\nb5c4\n```"
