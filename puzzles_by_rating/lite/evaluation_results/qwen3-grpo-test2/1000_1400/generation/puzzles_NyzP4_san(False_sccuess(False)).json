When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on a3 that could be dangerous\n- Black's rook on a5 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White's bishop on c4 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a5a4: Attacks the a3 pawn but allows Bb3 pinning the rook\n- a5a6: Keeps the rook active but doesn't address the a3 pawn\n- c7e5: Centralizes the queen and attacks the bishop\n- g8f8: Moves the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be c7e5 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the active bishop on c4\n- If Bb3, we can play Qe4+ winning the pawn on g4\n- If B moves away, we maintain pressure\n- It's more active than moving the king or rook\n\nOther moves either don't address the active pieces or allow White to maintain initiative. The queen move is most forcing and improves Black's position.\n\n```\nc7e5\n```"
