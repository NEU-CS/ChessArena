When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen is very active on c5\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's bishop on d5 is very strong\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5f8: Queen check, but Black can block with Rf8\n- c5d6: Attacks the bishop while maintaining pressure\n- e3h6: Bishop move attacking f8 square\n- e5e6: Pushing the passed pawn\n- b1c3: Developing the knight and attacking d5 bishop\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5d6:\n- It attacks the strong bishop on d5\n- If Black moves the bishop, Qd6 maintains pressure\n- If Black plays Bxd6, exd6 opens the e-file for White's rook\n- It maintains all of White's threats while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the strong bishop or miss opportunities to improve White's position. c5d6 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\nc5d6\n```"
