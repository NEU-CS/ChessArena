When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and queen vs Black's rook, bishop and queen. Material is roughly equal, but Black has a passed pawn on d4 that could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- White has a bishop pair\n- Black's d4 pawn is isolated and potentially weak\n- White's queen is active on b3\n- Black's bishop on g6 is blocked by its own pawn on e5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4h6: Bishop sacrifice to open Black's king, but Black can just take the bishop\n- b3b7: Queen checks the king, but Black can block with ...Qd7\n- g2c6: Bishop takes the strong d5 square, but Black can play ...Qd7\n- e1g1: Castling to safety, but misses tactical opportunities\n- b1c3: Developing the knight and attacking d5\n\n4. Best move seems to be g2c6:\n- Attacks the d5 square where Black's bishop is currently\n- If Black plays ...Qd7, White can play Qb7+ winning the exchange\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Qb7+ next move\n- Maintains pressure while developing a piece\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous move in the position.\n\n```\ng2c6\n```"
