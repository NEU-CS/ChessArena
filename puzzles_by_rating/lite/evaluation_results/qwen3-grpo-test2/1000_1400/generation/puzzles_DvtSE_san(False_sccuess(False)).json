When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has 3 pawns (a6, c6, c5) vs Black's 3 pawns (b6, e5, g4). Black has a king on b6, White's king is on e4.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on a6 that's very advanced\n- Black's king is tied to defending the b6 pawn\n- White's king is more active and can potentially support the a-pawn\n- Black has a passed pawn on g4 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- e4f5: Moves king towards black's pawns but away from the a-pawn\n- e4e5: Blocks black's e-pawn but doesn't make progress\n- e4d5: Moves king towards center but away from a-pawn\n- e4d3: Moves king towards a-pawn but may be too slow\n- c6c7: Advances the c-pawn but doesn't help the a-pawn\n- a6a7: Advances the passed a-pawn, which seems most promising\n\n4. Best move is a6a7 because:\n- It pushes the passed pawn which is White's most dangerous asset\n- Black's king cannot stop it (would have to leave b6 pawn)\n- Even if Black pushes g4-g3, White can still promote the a-pawn\n- Other moves either don't make progress or move the king away from the action\n\nThe immediate a6a7 is the most forcing move that creates winning chances.\n\n```\na6a7\n```"
