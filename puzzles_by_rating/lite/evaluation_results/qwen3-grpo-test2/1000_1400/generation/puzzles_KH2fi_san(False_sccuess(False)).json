When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on d3 that's very dangerous\n- White's rook on d6 is active but could be vulnerable\n- Black's knight on d3 is threatening to capture White's bishop on b3\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6d8: Rook retreat, but allows Black's d3 pawn to advance\n- b3d5: Bishop moves to attack the d3 pawn, but Black can play Nxd5\n- g3e4: Knight moves to block the d3 pawn's path\n- b3c4: Bishop moves to attack the d3 pawn while staying safe\n\n4. Best move seems to be b3c4:\n- Attacks the dangerous d3 pawn\n- If Black takes the bishop (Nxc4), White can play Rxd3 winning the pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can capture the pawn next move\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Keeps the bishop safe from the knight\n\nOther moves either don't address the d3 pawn or allow Black to maintain pressure. b3c4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nb3c4\n```"
