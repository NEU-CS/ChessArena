When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's bishop on d6 is very active\n- Black's queen on c6 is under attack by the bishop\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6e8: Queen moves to safety but allows Bxe8\n- c6d7: Queen moves away but blocks the bishop\n- c8d7: Bishop blocks the queen's attack on the bishop\n- g7h8: King moves to safety but seems passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be c8d7:\n- It blocks the queen's attack on the bishop\n- After Bxd7, Qxd7 maintains material equality\n- It keeps the bishop active and defends the queen\n- It prevents any immediate tactics from White\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threat to the bishop. c8d7 is the most solid move that maintains material balance while keeping pieces active.\n\n```\nc8d7\n```"
