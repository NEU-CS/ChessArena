When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and rook vs Black's bishop, queen and pawn. White is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on g3\n- White's bishop on c7 is blocked by its own pawn on b6\n- Black's bishop on f3 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White has a passed pawn on a5 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7d8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- c7d6: Bishop moves to a more active diagonal\n- a5a6: Pushing the passed pawn\n- d2d4: Centralizing the rook and attacking the e4 pawn\n- c1c6: Bishop moves to attack the b6 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be a5a6:\n- Pushes the passed pawn which could become dangerous\n- If Black takes (b6a6), White can play b4b5 creating another passed pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, the pawn can advance further\n- It's more active than bishop moves and better than rook moves that don't accomplish much\n\nThe pawn push creates the most problems for Black and is the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\na5a6\n```"
