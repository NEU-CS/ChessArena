When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Black is up in material (rook vs bishop).\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a strong passed pawn on a5\n- Black's queen on b4 is very active\n- White's bishop on d3 is blocked by its own pawn on e3\n- Black's rook on e8 is controlling the open file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d3g6: Bishop check, but Black can simply take the bishop\n- d3e4: Centralizing the bishop, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- b3d5: Capturing the knight, but Black can play Qb4xd5\n- a1a5: Capturing the passed pawn, but Black can play Qb4xa5\n- e3e4: Opening the bishop's diagonal and gaining space\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3e4:\n- Opens the bishop's diagonal\n- Gains central space\n- Prepares to double rooks on the d-file\n- If Black takes the pawn (dxe4), White can play Bg6+ winning the knight\n- If Black doesn't take, White has a strong centralized bishop\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to maintain the material advantage. e3e4 is the most active and improving move.\n\n```\ne3e4\n```"
