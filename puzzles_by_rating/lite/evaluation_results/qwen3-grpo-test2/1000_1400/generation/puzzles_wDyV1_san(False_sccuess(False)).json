When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a knight on c4 attacking d6\n- Black's queen on d6 is under attack by the knight\n- Black's rook on e5 is very active\n- White's pawn structure is slightly weak with isolated pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6c5: Moving the queen to safety while attacking the knight\n- d6e7: Moving the queen to defend the king\n- e5e4: Centralizing the rook and attacking the knight\n- d6f8: Moving the queen to a safe square\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6c5 because:\n- It gets the queen out of attack\n- It maintains pressure on the knight\n- It keeps the queen active in the center\n- It doesn't block any other pieces\n- It prepares potential discovered checks if the bishop moves\n\nOther moves like e5e4 allow White to play Nxd6 winning the queen, while d6e7 is too passive. d6f8 doesn't address the immediate threat to the queen.\n\n```\nd6c5\n```"
