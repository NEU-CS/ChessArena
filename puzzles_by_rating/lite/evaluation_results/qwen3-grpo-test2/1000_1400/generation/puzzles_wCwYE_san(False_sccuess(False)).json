When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (no pieces captured yet). Black has a bishop pair, but White has better pawn structure.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- White has a bishop on g5 pinning the f6 knight to the queen\n- Black has a bishop on g4 attacking White's f3 knight\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has a pawn on d5 controlling the c4 square\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h6: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Bxh6\n- g5f6: Bishop takes knight, but Black can play Qe7 defending\n- c3d5: Knight takes pawn, but Black can play Bxd5\n- d1a4: Queen takes bishop, but Black can play Bb5\n- e3e4: Pushing pawn to challenge Black's bishop\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3e4:\n- It challenges Black's active bishop on g4\n- If Black takes (Bxe4), White can play Nxe4 and the pin on f6 remains\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can play Nxe4 winning a pawn\n- It opens the e-file for White's rook\n- It maintains the pin on f6\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish as much or allow Black to maintain pressure. e3e4 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\ne3e4\n```"
