When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawns vs White's queen, knight and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed e-pawn.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's bishop on b6 is blocked by its own pawn on e5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a knight on d2 that could become active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h4: Attacks the queen, but Qxh4 would win the bishop\n- d8g5: Pins the queen to the king, but Qxg5 is possible\n- b6d4: Captures the pawn and opens the bishop's diagonal\n- e5d4: Captures the pawn but allows Nxd4\n\n4. Best move seems to be b6d4:\n- Wins a pawn\n- Opens the bishop's diagonal towards White's king\n- After Nxd4, Black can play Qd7 attacking the knight\n- If White doesn't take, Black has a strong bishop on d4\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow White to maintain the initiative. b6d4 is the most forcing and concrete way to improve Black's position.\n\n```\nb6d4\n```"
