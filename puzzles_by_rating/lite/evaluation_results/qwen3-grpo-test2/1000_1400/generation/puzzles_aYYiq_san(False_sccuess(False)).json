When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on a7\n- White has a passed pawn on a5\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on c5\n- White's bishop on b3 is very active\n- Black's knight on g3 is threatening\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b3g8: Bishop takes rook, but Black can play Qxg8\n- b3f7: Bishop checks the king, but Black can block with Qe7\n- c3f6: Queen moves to attack the king, but Black can play Kb7\n- e3f4: Pawn moves to block the knight's threat\n\n4. Best move seems to be b3g8:\n- It wins the exchange (bishop for rook)\n- After Qxg8, White can play Qxg8 and still have a material advantage\n- It removes Black's active rook from the board\n- It maintains pressure on Black's king\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow Black to maintain counterplay. The immediate b3g8 is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\nb3g8\n```"
