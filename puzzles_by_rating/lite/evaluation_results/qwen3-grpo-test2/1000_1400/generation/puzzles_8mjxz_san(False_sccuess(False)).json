When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a knight on g7 threatening to capture the rook on e8\n- Black has a bishop on h4 attacking White's pawn on f2\n- Black's queen on g5 is very active\n- White's king is on h2, somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5f4: Centralizing the queen and attacking the bishop on b3\n- h4g3: Capturing the pawn and opening lines against White's king\n- e6c4: Moving the bishop to a more active diagonal\n- g8h7: Moving the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be h4g3:\n- Wins a pawn immediately\n- Opens the h-file against White's king\n- After Kxg3, Black can play Qf4+ winning the bishop on b3\n- Even if White doesn't take the pawn, Black gains time and initiative\n\nOther moves either don't win material or leave the king exposed. h4g3 is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\nh4g3\n```"
