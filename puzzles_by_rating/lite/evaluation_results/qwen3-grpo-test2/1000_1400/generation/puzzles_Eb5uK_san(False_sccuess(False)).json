When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, pawn and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a queen on a2 attacking White's rook on e1\n- White's queen on e5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on g4 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5h8: Queen check, but Black can block with g7\n- e5e8: Queen check, but Black can take with rook\n- e5g7: Captures the pawn with check, but Black can play Kxg7\n- e5f6: Centralizes queen and threatens f7\n- e1a1: Moves rook out of attack but seems passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5g7:\n- It's a check that wins a pawn\n- After Kxg7, White can play Qxg7+ winning the rook on c3\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White maintains strong pressure\n- It's the most forcing move in the position\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow Black to consolidate. e5g7 is the most aggressive and winning move.\n\n```\ne5g7\n```"
