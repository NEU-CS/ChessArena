When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on f2, attacking h4 pawn and eyeing the king\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black has a rook on g3 controlling the g-file\n- White has a knight on h2 that's not very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h2f3: Blocks the queen's diagonal but leaves the knight exposed\n- e1e4: Captures the dangerous passed pawn but allows Qxh4\n- d1d3: Defends h4 pawn but doesn't address the e4 pawn\n- g4f5: Pushes the pawn but allows Qxh4\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1e4:\n- Eliminates Black's dangerous passed pawn\n- After Qxh4, White can play Qd3 attacking the queen\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Qd3 next move\n- Maintains control of h4 pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the e4 pawn or allow Black to maintain too much pressure. e1e4 is the most forcing move that improves White's position.\n\n```\ne1e4\n```"
