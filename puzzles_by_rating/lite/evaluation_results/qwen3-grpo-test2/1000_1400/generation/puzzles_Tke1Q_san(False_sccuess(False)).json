When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen on g4 is very active\n- Black's bishop on g7 is blocking the queen's diagonal\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black has a pawn on e5 that's restricting White's pieces\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4c8: Queen checks the king, but Black can block with ...Qd7\n- g4d7: Captures the bishop, but Black can play ...Qxd7\n- e3h6: Bishop move attacking the king, but Black can play ...Kf7\n- c3b5: Knight move attacking the pawn on a6\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4d7:\n- It wins the bishop on g7\n- After ...Qxd7, White can play Bxh6 winning another pawn\n- Even if Black doesn't take the queen, White gains material\n- It's the most forcing move in the position\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow Black to consolidate. g4d7 is the most concrete way to gain an advantage.\n\n```\ng4d7\n```"
