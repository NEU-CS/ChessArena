When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on e6 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- Black's rook on h5 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h8: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n- c6e5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n- h5e5: Rook takes the queen - but after Qxe5, Black's king is still exposed\n- b6d4: Captures the passed pawn but allows Qxc6\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6e5:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the dangerous white queen\n- If Q moves, Black can play h5e5 winning the queen\n- If Q takes, Black has b6d4 winning the passed pawn\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving piece activity\n\nOther moves either don't address the active white queen or allow White to maintain initiative. c6e5 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
