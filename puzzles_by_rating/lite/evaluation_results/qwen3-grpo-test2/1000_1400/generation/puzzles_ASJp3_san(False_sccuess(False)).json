When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, queen and pawns vs Black's rook, queen and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on d3\n- White's queen is active on g4\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a rook on b7 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7b8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- g4c8: Queen takes rook, but after ...Qxc8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- g4d7: Queen takes pawn, but allows ...Qxd7\n- g4e6: Centralizes queen and attacks f7\n- g4h5: Checks the king, but Black can just take the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4e6:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the f7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If Black takes the queen (Qxe6), then Rb7xb6 wins a pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Qe6xf7 winning material\n- Maintains all of White's threats while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to consolidate. g4e6 is the most active and threatening move.\n\n```\ng4e6\n```"
