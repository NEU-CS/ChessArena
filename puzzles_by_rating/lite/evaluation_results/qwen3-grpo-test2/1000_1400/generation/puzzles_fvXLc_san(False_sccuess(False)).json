When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Black is down a queen for a bishop, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on e7 that's very active\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's queen on e2 is eyeing the black king\n- Black's queen on d6 is under attack by the e7 knight\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e7: Capturing the active knight, but after Nxe7 Black's king remains exposed\n- d6h2: Checking the king, but White can simply take the queen\n- d6d1: Moving the queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n- f8g8: Moving the rook to defend the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6e7:\n- It eliminates White's dangerous knight\n- After Nxe7, Black can play Qxe7 maintaining material balance\n- It's the most forcing move in the position\n- Other queen moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threat\n\nThe move d6e7 solves the most pressing problem (the attacking knight) while maintaining material equality after the exchange. It's the most logical choice in this difficult position.\n\n```\nd6e7\n```"
