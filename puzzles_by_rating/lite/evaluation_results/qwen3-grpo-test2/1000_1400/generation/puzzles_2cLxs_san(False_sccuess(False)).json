When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, knight and pawns. Black is up in material but White has some compensation with the bishop pair and active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on g5\n- White's bishop on d3 is blocked by pawns\n- Black has a knight on g3 attacking f1\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d3g6: Bishop checks the king, but Black can just take the bishop\n- d3e4: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the queen\n- f2g3: Captures the knight but allows Qxg3\n- a1a4: Moves the rook to a more active file\n- f3f4: Pushes the pawn to challenge Black's queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be d3e4:\n- Centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks the active queen\n- If queen moves, we can play f3f4 next, challenging the queen's position\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics from Black\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow Black to maintain their material advantage without compensation.\n\n```\nd3e4\n```"
