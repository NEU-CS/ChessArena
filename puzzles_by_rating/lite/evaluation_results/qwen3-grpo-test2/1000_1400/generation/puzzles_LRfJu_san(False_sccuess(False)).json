When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's bishop on f3 is very active, controlling important squares\n- White's rook on c8 is passive\n- Black's rook on g7 is controlling the g-file\n- White's king is exposed on b1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3h5: Bishop checks the king, but White can just move the king\n- f3g4: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the e2 pawn\n- f3e4: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the d3 pawn\n- g7h7: Rook move that doesn't accomplish much\n- b7b6: Pawn move that doesn't address immediate concerns\n\n4. Best move seems to be f3g4:\n- Centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks the e2 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If White takes the bishop (hxg4), Black can play Rg1+ winning the rook\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with Bxe2 winning a pawn\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to consolidate.\n\n```\nf3g4\n```"
