When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight, queen and pawns. Black is down a queen for a bishop, which is a significant material deficit.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on d6 that's very dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- White's queen on g3 is very active\n- Black's knight on d5 is under attack by White's pawn on f3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7: Retreating the knight to safety while attacking the d6 pawn\n- d5c7: Moving the knight to a safer square\n- h8g8: Connecting rooks and getting the king to safety\n- d8e7: Moving the queen to defend the knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5e7 because:\n- It saves the knight from capture\n- It attacks the dangerous d6 pawn\n- It maintains material balance by keeping the knight active\n- It doesn't allow White to push the d-pawn further\n- Other moves either don't address the immediate threats or leave pieces hanging\n\nThe move d5e7 solves the most pressing problems in the position while maintaining some counterplay against White's passed pawn.\n\n```\nd5e7\n```"
