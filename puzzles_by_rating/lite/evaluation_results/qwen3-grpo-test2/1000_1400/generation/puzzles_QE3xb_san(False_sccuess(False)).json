When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's knight and bishop. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on b5 attacking the a7 pawn\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's bishop on c4 is very active\n- Black's knight on f6 is blocking the f-pawn\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on d2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5c7: Captures the bishop, but Black can recapture with the knight\n- c4f7: Bishop check, but Black can block with the knight\n- c3e4: Centralizes the knight and attacks f6\n- d2e2: Moves the king to a safer square\n\n4. Best move seems to be b5c7:\n- Wins the bishop for a knight (material gain)\n- After Nxc7, White can play Bf7+ winning the exchange (rook for bishop)\n- Black's position would collapse as they lose material and their king remains exposed\n\nOther moves either don't win material or don't capitalize on White's active pieces. The immediate b5c7 is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\nb5c7\n```"
