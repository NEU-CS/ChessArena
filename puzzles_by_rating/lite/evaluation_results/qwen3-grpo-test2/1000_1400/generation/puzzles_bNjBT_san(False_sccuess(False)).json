When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's king is on h5, Black's king on e5\n- Black's rook is on d4, White's rook on d7\n- Black pawn on f6, White pawn on h4\n- Black has a passed pawn on e5 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f5: Advances the passed pawn but allows White's king to approach\n- e5e4: Centralizes the pawn but doesn't make progress\n- d4d5: Attacks the e5 pawn but allows White's rook to check\n- f6f5: Advances the pawn but blocks the black king\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5f5 because:\n- It advances the passed pawn which is Black's main asset\n- After Kxf5, Black can play Rf4+ winning the h4 pawn\n- If White doesn't take, the pawn can queen\n- Other moves either don't make progress or allow White to consolidate\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is e5f5, creating immediate threats that White must address.\n\n```\ne5f5\n```"
