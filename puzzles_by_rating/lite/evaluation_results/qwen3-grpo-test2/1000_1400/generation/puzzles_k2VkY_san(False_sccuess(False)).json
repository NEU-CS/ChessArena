When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and queen vs White's rook, queen and pawns. Black is up a bishop but White has some compensation with the passed d-pawn.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's d5 pawn is passed and dangerous\n- Black's queen is very active on h5\n- Black's bishop on f5 is controlling important squares\n- White's queen on g3 is eyeing the h4 square\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h4: Attacks the g3 queen and threatens to win material\n- f5g4: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the d5 pawn\n- e8e4: Centralizes the rook and attacks the d5 pawn\n- h5g4: Attacks the d5 pawn while keeping pressure on White's position\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5h4:\n- Immediately wins the queen after Qxh4 Bxh4\n- If White doesn't take, Black maintains strong pressure\n- Even if White finds a way to defend, Black's pieces are very active\n- The move also prevents White from playing Qh4 in some lines\n\nOther moves like f5g4 or e8e4 are good but don't win material immediately. h5h4 is the most forcing and decisive move.\n\n```\nh5h4\n```"
