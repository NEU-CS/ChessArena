When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's rook on h8 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black has a passed pawn on d3 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on b3 that's blocked by Black's pawn on d5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Rook check, but Black can just take the rook with Kxg8\n- c7c8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- c7h7: Rook move to h7, attacking the h5 pawn\n- c7d7: Rook moves to d7, attacking the d3 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be c7d7 because:\n- It attacks the dangerous passed pawn on d3\n- If Black takes the rook (Rxd3), White can play Rxd3 and then capture the h5 pawn\n- If Black moves the king, White can play Rxd3 immediately\n- It maintains pressure while keeping the rook active\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or don't maintain the initiative. The move c7d7 is the most forcing and maintains White's advantage.\n\n```\nc7d7\n```"
