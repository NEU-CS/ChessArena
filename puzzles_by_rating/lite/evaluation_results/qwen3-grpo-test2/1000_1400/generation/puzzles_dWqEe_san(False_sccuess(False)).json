When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on c2 is threatening to take the bishop on e2\n- White's rook on h5 is active but could be vulnerable\n- Black's knight on g4 is threatening to fork with Nf2\n- White's king is exposed on f2\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f2f3: Blocks the queen's diagonal but leaves king exposed to Nf2\n- f2g1: Moves king towards safety but allows Qxe2\n- f2f1: Moves king towards safety but allows Qxe2\n- f2e1: Moves king towards safety and protects e2 bishop\n\n4. Best move is f2e1 because:\n- It gets the king to relative safety\n- Protects the e2 bishop\n- If Black takes the bishop (Qxe2), White can play Rh5e5 attacking the queen\n- Other moves either allow Qxe2 or leave the king exposed to Nf2\n\n```\nf2e1\n```"
