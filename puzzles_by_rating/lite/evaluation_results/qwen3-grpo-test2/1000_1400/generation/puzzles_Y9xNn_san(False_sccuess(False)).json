When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on f2, attacking White's rook on h1\n- White's queen on c4 is very active but potentially exposed\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White has a passed pawn on h6 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c4g8: Queen checks the king, but Black can block with ...Rg8\n- c4f7: Queen checks the king, but Black can take with ...Rxf7\n- h1h5: Moves the rook away from attack but doesn't address the queen threat\n- d1d2: Moves the king to safety but seems passive\n- c4h4: Moves the queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n\n4. Best move seems to be c4h4:\n- Gets the queen to safety away from potential checks\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n- Keeps options open for future attacks\n- After Qh4, Black's queen must move, and White can then consider h6-h7 pushing the passed pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or miss opportunities. c4h4 is the most precise move in this position.\n\n```\nc4h4\n```"
