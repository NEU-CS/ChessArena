When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook and pawns vs White's queen, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen is very active on d8\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- White has a knight on f4 controlling important squares\n- Black's rook on c1 is active but could be vulnerable\n- Both sides have passed pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h8: Moves queen to safety but doesn't address any threats\n- g7f6: Blocks the f-file and attacks the knight, but allows Qd8h4+\n- c1c8: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- g6g5: Advances the pawn but exposes the king more\n\n4. Best move seems to be g7e5:\n- Attacks the knight on f4\n- If Nf4 moves, Black can play Qe5d4 winning a pawn\n- If Nf4e2, Black can play Qe5d4+ winning the e2 pawn\n- If Nf4d3, Black can play Qe5d4+ winning the d3 pawn\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't allow any immediate checks or threats\n\nThis seems like the most active and forcing move, winning material while maintaining the initiative.\n\n```\ng7e5\n```"
