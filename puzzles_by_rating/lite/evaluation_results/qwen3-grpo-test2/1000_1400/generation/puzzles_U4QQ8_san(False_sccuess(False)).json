When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and knight vs White's bishop and knight, so material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on c6 that could be dangerous\n- Black's bishop on d6 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n- White's bishop on b4 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a knight on e5 that's very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e7: Blocks the passed pawn but leaves the bishop passive\n- f6e4: Attacks the active knight on e5\n- d8e7: Centralizes the queen and prepares to defend the d6 bishop\n- g7g6: Creates luft for the king but weakens the dark squares\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6e4:\n- It attacks the strong knight on e5\n- If White takes the knight (e5e4), Black can play d6e7 blocking the passed pawn\n- If White moves the knight, Black gains time to improve position\n- It maintains control over key squares\n- It's a active move that puts pressure on White's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the active pieces or allow White to maintain initiative. f6e4 is the most challenging move for White to face.\n\n```\nf6e4\n```"
