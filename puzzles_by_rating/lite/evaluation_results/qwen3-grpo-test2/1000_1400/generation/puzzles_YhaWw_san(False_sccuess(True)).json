When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Queen, Rook, Pawn\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, 2 Pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has Q+R+P vs Black's Q+R+2P)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on a6\n- White's queen on c6 is very active\n- Black's queen on e2 is controlling the promotion square of White's h-pawn\n- Black's rook on b7 is defending the a6 king\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- a6a7: Moves king towards center but into potential checks from White's queen\n- a6a5: Moves king away from center but still leaves it exposed\n- b7b6: Moves rook to defend the king while maintaining control of the a-file\n\n4. Best move is b7b6 because:\n- It defends the king by covering a6\n- Maintains control of the a-file\n- Prevents any potential checks from White's queen\n- Keeps options open for the rook to move along the 7th rank\n- Doesn't expose the king further like the other options\n\nThe other moves either expose the king or don't improve Black's position. b7b6 is the most solid choice.\n\n```\nb7b6\n```"
