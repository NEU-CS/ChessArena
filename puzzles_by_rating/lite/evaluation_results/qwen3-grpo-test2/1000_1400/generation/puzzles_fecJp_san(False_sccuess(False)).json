When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen, pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight, queen, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong knight on g6 attacking Black's king\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's bishop on c8 is blocked by pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e7e8: Moves king to safety but blocks the rook's file\n- e7f7: Moves king towards center but still exposed to checks\n- e7d7: Moves king towards queenside but away from danger\n- e7e6: Moves king forward but into potential checks\n- e7d6: Moves king towards center but still exposed\n- h7g6: Captures the dangerous knight on g6\n\n4. Best move is h7g6 because:\n- It removes the dangerous knight that's threatening Black's king\n- After Nxg6, Black can play Qd7 to connect rooks and defend\n- It prevents any immediate checks or threats from the knight\n- It's the most forcing move in the position\n\nThe other king moves don't address the immediate threat of the knight on g6.\n\n```\nh7g6\n```"
