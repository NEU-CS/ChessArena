When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and rook. Material is roughly equal, but Black's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a bishop on b4 pinning White's knight on c3 to the king\n- White's bishop on c4 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's rook on h8 is not very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c4e6: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play ...Kxe6\n- c3d5: Centralizing the knight, but doesn't address the pin\n- d1d7: Moving the king to break the pin, but seems passive\n- c4d5: Bishop moves to d5, attacking the pinned knight\n- h1h2: Preparing to double rooks, but slow\n\n4. Best move seems to be c4d5:\n- It attacks the pinned knight on c3\n- If Black takes the bishop (Bxd5), White can play Nxd5 winning the bishop pair\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure\n- It opens the c-file for White's rook\n- It keeps all of White's pieces active\n\nOther moves either don't address the pin or don't improve White's position as much. c4d5 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nc4d5\n```"
