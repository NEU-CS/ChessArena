When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and queen vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's queen on d5 is very active\n- Black's rook on f3 is threatening White's pawn on h3\n- White's knight on e6 is very strong, attacking f8 and g7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6f8: Knight check, but Black can take the knight with the queen\n- d5d8: Queen check, but Black can block with the queen\n- d5h5: Queen attacks the h7 pawn and threatens to check on h8\n- e6g7: Knight move attacking the h5 pawn and covering h8\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5h5:\n- Attacks the h7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- Prepares Qh8+ next move if Black doesn't defend\n- If Black plays ...Qxh5, then Nf8+ wins the rook\n- If Black does nothing, Qh8+ is mate\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to defend. d5h5 is the most forcing move that creates immediate threats against Black's king.\n\n```\nd5h5\n```"
