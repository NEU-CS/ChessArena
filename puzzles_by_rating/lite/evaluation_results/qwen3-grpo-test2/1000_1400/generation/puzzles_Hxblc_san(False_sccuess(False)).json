When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on g5\n- White's knight on f4 is threatening to jump to g6 or h5\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h4: Attacks the rook on g1, but White can just move it\n- g4h6: Attacks the knight, but White can play Nf5\n- g5e7: Centralizes the queen and defends the d6 pawn\n- g5f6: Attacks the knight and covers the h4 square\n- d4d3: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g5f6 because:\n- It attacks the knight on f4\n- If White moves the knight, Black can play Qxf4 winning material\n- It covers the h4 square against potential rook checks\n- It maintains control of key squares\n- It doesn't allow any counterplay from White\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or miss opportunities to win material.\n\n```\ng5f6\n```"
