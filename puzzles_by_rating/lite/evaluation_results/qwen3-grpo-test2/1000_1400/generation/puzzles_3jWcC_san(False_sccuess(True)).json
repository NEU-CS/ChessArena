When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, Bishop, Knight, Pawn, Knight, Pawn, King\n- Black has: Rook, Rook, Knight, Bishop, King, Pawn, Pawn, Pawn\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two bishops vs knight+bishop)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's king is exposed on e6\n- White's bishop on c6 is very active\n- Black's knight on b6 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on c6\n\n3. The only legal move is b6d5 (capturing the passed pawn). Let's see the consequences:\n- After b6d5, White can play Bxd5, winning the pawn\n- But then Black can play Rf8, attacking the bishop\n- White would have to move the bishop, and Black can consolidate\n\n4. Alternatives:\n- There are no other legal moves - b6d5 is the only option\n\nThe move b6d5 is forced, despite losing the pawn, because:\n- It removes White's dangerous passed pawn\n- It opens the b-file for Black's rook\n- It maintains the pin on White's bishop\n- After Bxd5 Rf8, Black can defend the position\n\nTherefore, the best and only move is:\n\n```\nb6d5\n```"
