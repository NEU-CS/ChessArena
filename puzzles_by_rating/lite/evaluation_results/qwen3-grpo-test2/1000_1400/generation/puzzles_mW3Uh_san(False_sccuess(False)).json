When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on h6\n- White's rook on c5 is very active\n- Black's bishop on b1 is blocked by its own pawn on a7\n- White has a passed pawn on b5 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5c8: Rook lift to attack the a8 rook, but Black can defend\n- b2e5: Bishop centralizes and attacks the weak h6 king\n- b5b6: Advances the passed pawn\n- a4a5: Prepares to push the b-pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be b2e5 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- It directly attacks the exposed black king on h6\n- It cuts off escape squares for the black king\n- After Bb1-e5, Black has no good way to defend against the threat of Rb5-b7 or Rb5-b8\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position as much or allow Black to consolidate. The bishop move is the most forcing and creates immediate threats.\n\n```\nb2e5\n```"
