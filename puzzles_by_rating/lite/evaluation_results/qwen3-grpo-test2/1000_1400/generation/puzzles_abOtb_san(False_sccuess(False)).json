When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's bishop on b5 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e7 is blocked by pawns\n- White has a strong pawn center with e4 and d4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h6: Gets the king to safety but looks passive\n- d7e6: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the d4 pawn\n- c6d4: Captures the passed pawn but allows Bxd4\n- d8a5: Attacks the b5 bishop but seems too slow\n\n4. Best move seems to be d7e6 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- It attacks the dangerous d4 pawn\n- It prepares to bring the queen to d7 to support the bishop\n- It maintains flexibility for the king\n- It doesn't allow any immediate tactics from White\n\nOther moves either don't address the d4 pawn or leave the king exposed. d7e6 is the most active and principled move.\n\n```\nd7e6\n```"
