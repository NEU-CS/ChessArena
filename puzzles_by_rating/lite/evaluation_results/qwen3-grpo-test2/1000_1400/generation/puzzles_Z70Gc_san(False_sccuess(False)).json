When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and queen vs White's queen and bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on e6 that could be dangerous\n- Black's queen on g3 is very active but potentially exposed\n- Black's bishop on g6 is blocked by its own pawn on h5\n- White's king is still in the center while Black's is castled\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3h4: Centralizes the queen and attacks the h4 pawn\n- g3f4: Attacks the e3 pawn and keeps pressure\n- g6f5: Opens the bishop's diagonal and attacks e4\n- h5g4: Opens the h-file for the rook and attacks the g4 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g6f5 because:\n- It opens the bishop's diagonal towards White's king\n- Attacks the e4 pawn which is only defended by the d3 pawn\n- If White takes the bishop (exf5), Black can play Qxh4 winning a pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with Qf4 or Qh4 with strong pressure\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position as much or allow White to consolidate. g6f5 creates immediate threats and improves Black's piece activity.\n\n```\ng6f5\n```"
