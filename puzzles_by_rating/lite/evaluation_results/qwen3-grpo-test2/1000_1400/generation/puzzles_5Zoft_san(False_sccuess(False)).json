When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on f5\n- Black's bishop on c5 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on d1\n- Black's knight on e7 is somewhat restricted\n- White's queen on f3 is eyeing the f7 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5d4: Centralizing the bishop and attacking the knight on d3\n- e7g6: Moving the knight to a more active square\n- c5e3: Forking the queen and rook\n- d7d6: Challenging the f5 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5e3:\n- It's a fork attacking both the queen on f3 and rook on h1\n- White can't save both pieces (if Qe2, then Rxh1)\n- Even if White finds a way to save material, Black gains time\n- It's a forcing move that disrupts White's coordination\n\nOther moves like c5d4 are good but don't create immediate threats. e7g6 is too slow, and d7d6 allows White to consolidate.\n\n```\nc5e3\n```"
