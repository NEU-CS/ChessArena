When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawns vs White's knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is more active (e5) while White's king is on g3\n- Black has a passed pawn on c6\n- White has a knight on c5 that's very active\n- Black's bishop on a5 is somewhat restricted by its own pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f6: King moves towards center but away from pawns\n- e5d6: King moves towards c6 pawn but exposes to checks\n- a5d8: Bishop retreats but seems passive\n- a5b4: Bishop attacks d2 pawn but allows Nc5-b7\n- g6g5: Pushes pawn but doesn't achieve much\n- f5f4: Pushes pawn but weakens king position\n\n4. Best move seems to be a5b4:\n- Attacks the d2 pawn which is unprotected\n- If White takes bishop (Nc5b4), Black can play f5f4 creating a passed pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can maintain pressure\n- Keeps bishop active and flexible\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish much or allow White to consolidate. a5b4 creates immediate threats and maintains Black's initiative.\n\n```\na5b4\n```"
