When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is up in material (queen vs no major piece for white).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on h3, threatening to capture the g2 pawn\n- White's king is exposed on f1\n- Black's knight on f4 is well placed\n- White's rook on a6 is passive\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n- f1g1: Moves king towards the corner, but doesn't address the queen threat\n- f1e1: Moves king towards the center but still leaves g2 pawn hanging\n- e4g2: Captures the dangerous queen with the bishop\n\n4. e4g2 seems forced because:\n- It eliminates Black's most dangerous piece (the queen)\n- After Qxg2, White can play Rxa7 winning the rook\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White removes the immediate threat\n- Other king moves leave the g2 pawn hanging, which would be disastrous\n\nThe best move is clearly to capture the queen:\n\n```\ne4g2\n```"
