When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, pawn and queen vs White's rook, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's king is exposed on g5\n- Black's queen is very active on h1\n- White's rook on e4 is controlling important squares\n- Black's rook on f8 is passive\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h1e4: Capturing the rook would be great, but White can play Qxe4 winning the queen\n- h1f3: Checking the king, but White can take the queen with Qxf3\n- f8e8: Centralizing the rook and preparing to double on the e-file\n- g6h5: Pushing the pawn to open lines against White's king\n\n4. Best move seems to be h1e4:\n- It wins the exchange (rook for queen)\n- After Qxe4, Black can play Qxe4+ winning the queen\n- White's king is too exposed to take the queen immediately\n- This leads to a winning endgame for Black\n\nThe immediate capture is safest and most forcing, leading to a clear material advantage.\n\n```\nh1e4\n```"
