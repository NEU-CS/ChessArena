When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong bishop on d4 controlling important squares\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on e4 that could be dangerous\n- Black's knight on c6 is under pressure from White's bishop\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- f6e8: Centralizes the knight but blocks the rook\n- d6e5: Attacks the strong bishop on d4\n- c6d4: Captures the bishop but allows e4e3 opening the e-file\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6e5:\n- It attacks the strong bishop on d4\n- If White takes the knight (Bxe5), Black can play Qd7 attacking the bishop again\n- If White moves the bishop, Black gains time to consolidate\n- It maintains control over key squares\n- It doesn't allow any immediate counterplay from White\n\nOther moves either don't address the strong bishop or allow White to maintain pressure. d6e5 is the most active and challenging response.\n\n```\nd6e5\n```"
