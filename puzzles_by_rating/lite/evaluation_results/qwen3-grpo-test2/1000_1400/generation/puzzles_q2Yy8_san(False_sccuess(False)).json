When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's queen and bishop. Black is up in material (queen vs knight+bishop).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's knight on c6 is very active\n- Black's queen on c7 is controlling important squares\n- White's bishop on e2 is blocked by pawns\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6d8: Knight check, but Black can just take the knight with the queen\n- c6e7: Knight fork attacking queen and bishop, but Black can play Qxe7\n- e2h5: Bishop move attacking f7 pawn, but doesn't create threats\n- c2g6: Bishop move attacking f7 pawn, but Black can defend\n- c6a5: Knight move attacking b7 pawn, but not very forcing\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6e7:\n- It's a knight fork attacking both queen and bishop\n- Even if Black takes the knight (Qxe7), White can play Bg6+ winning the f7 pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White wins the queen after Nxc7\n\nThis is the most forcing and winning move in the position. All other moves either don't create threats or allow Black to maintain material advantage.\n\n```\nc6e7\n```"
