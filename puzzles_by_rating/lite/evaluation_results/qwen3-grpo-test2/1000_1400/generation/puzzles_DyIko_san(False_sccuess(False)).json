When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a pawn on d7 and king on h4. Black has a rook on d1, pawns on g6 and f3, and king on g4. Material is roughly equal (pawn vs rook, but White has a passed pawn).\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's d7 pawn is very advanced and can promote\n- Black's rook is active but can be harassed by White's king\n- Black's f3 pawn is dangerous and close to promotion\n- White's king is somewhat exposed but can help stop Black's pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7d8q: Promotes the pawn immediately, but Black can play Rxd8\n- h4g5: Moves king towards Black's pawns, but allows f2\n- c3c4: Moves king towards center, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- h4e7: Centralizes king and prepares to support d-pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be h4e7 because:\n- Centralizes the king\n- Prepares to support the d-pawn's promotion (Ke7-d6-c7)\n- Gets the king closer to stop Black's f-pawn (Ke7-f6)\n- After 1...f2 2.Ke7-f6 f1=Q 3.Kxf7 and White wins\n- If Black doesn't push f2, White can promote the d-pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or miss the chance to centralize the king. The pawn promotion is tempting but premature as Black can just take it.\n\n```\nh4e7\n```"
