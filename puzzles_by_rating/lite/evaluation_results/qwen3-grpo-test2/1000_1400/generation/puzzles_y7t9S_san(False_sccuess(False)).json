When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a knight on e3 that's very active\n- White's knight on f5 is well placed but could be captured by Black's bishop on b7\n- White's bishop on d3 is blocked by its own pawn on e3\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- White has a passed pawn on a3 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5g7: Captures the bishop but allows Black to play ...Qxg7\n- d3b5: Attacks the a6 pawn and opens the bishop's diagonal\n- c3d5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the e3 knight\n- a3a4: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3d5 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the dangerous e3 knight\n- If Black takes (Nxd5), White can play Bxg6 winning a pawn\n- If Black moves the e3 knight, White can play Nxe3 winning material\n- It maintains all of White's options while improving piece activity\n\nThe move c3d5 puts maximum pressure on Black's position while improving White's piece coordination.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
