When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a bishop on c3 controlling important squares\n- White's queen is active on d3\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on b4\n- Black has a pawn on b5 that could be weak\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d3d6: Centralizes queen but allows ...Qxd6\n- d3d5: Attacks the b5 pawn but allows ...Qxd5\n- d3b5: Captures the pawn but allows ...Qxb5\n- d3c4: Attacks the bishop but allows ...Qxc4\n- e4f5: Opens the e-file but gives up central control\n- a3a4: Pushes the passed pawn but it's not immediately threatening\n\n4. Best move seems to be d3b5:\n- Wins a pawn immediately\n- After ...Qxb5, White can play Qxc3 winning the bishop\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure\n- The pawn on b5 is weak and should be eliminated\n\nThe most forcing and advantageous move is to capture the pawn immediately.\n\n```\nd3b5\n```"
