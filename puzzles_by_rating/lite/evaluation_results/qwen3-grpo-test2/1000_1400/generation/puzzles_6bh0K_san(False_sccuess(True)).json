When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's queen and knight. Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on a6 is eyeing the a2 pawn\n- White's knight on h8 is trapped but attacking f7\n- Black's knight on g3 is very active\n- White's bishop on g2 is blocked by its own pawn on h3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8f7: Captures the pawn but allows Qxa2\n- d2h6: Attacks the queen but doesn't solve a2 pawn issue\n- c2a4: Defends a2 but allows Qxa4\n- b1b7: Moves the rook to a more active file\n\n4. Best move seems to be h8f7:\n- Wins a pawn immediately\n- After Qxa2, White can play Bf3 attacking the queen\n- If Black doesn't take a2, White has a strong knight on f7\n- Other moves either don't address the a2 pawn or don't win material\n\nThe move h8f7 is the most forcing and wins material while maintaining activity. Black's best response would likely be Qxa2, but then White can play Bf3 with a strong attack.\n\n```\nh8f7\n```"
