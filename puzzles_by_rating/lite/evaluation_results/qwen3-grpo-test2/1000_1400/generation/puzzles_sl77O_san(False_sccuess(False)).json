When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on f8 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black has a knight on e5 that's very active\n- Black has a queen on a5 that's not well placed\n- White has a passed pawn on e4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f7: Attacks the queen but allows Qxf7 winning the knight\n- e5d7: Blocks the queen's diagonal but seems passive\n- a5d8: Centralizes the queen but doesn't address immediate threats\n- b2b3: Captures the pawn but allows Qxf7\n- e5g4: Attacks the e4 pawn but seems slow\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5f3:\n- Attacks the e4 pawn which is White's most advanced pawn\n- If White takes the knight (Qxf3), Black can play Qd8+ winning the bishop\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play Nxd4 winning a pawn\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n\nThis seems like the most active and forcing move in the position, creating immediate threats while maintaining piece activity.\n\n```\ne5f3\n```"
