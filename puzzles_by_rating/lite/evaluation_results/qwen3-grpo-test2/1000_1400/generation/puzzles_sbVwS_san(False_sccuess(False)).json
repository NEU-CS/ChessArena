When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawn for a knight, which is roughly equal. White has a passed pawn on e5 that could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on f3 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n- Black's queen on b6 is somewhat exposed\n- White's rook on f1 is eyeing the f-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6f5: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the e5 pawn, but allows Nxd5\n- c5d4: Opens the diagonal for the bishop and attacks the e5 pawn\n- b6d8: Gets the queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n- c4b3: Captures a pawn but leaves the c5 bishop hanging\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5d4:\n- Opens the diagonal for the bishop\n- Attacks the e5 pawn which is Black's main concern\n- If White takes the bishop (Bxd4), Black can play Qxd4 with a strong queen\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play Bf5 next move, increasing pressure\n\nOther moves either don't address the e5 pawn or leave pieces vulnerable. c5d4 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nc5d4\n```"
