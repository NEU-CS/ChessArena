When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and rook vs White's rook and king. Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e6\n- Black's knight on a3 is very active\n- Black's rook on b3 is controlling the b-file\n- White's rook on a7 is blocked by Black's pawn on g7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b3b8: Rook lift to potentially check the king\n- a3b5: Knight move attacking the king\n- d4d3: Pushing the passed pawn\n- g7g5: Creating luft for the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be a3b5:\n- It directly attacks the exposed white king\n- If White moves the king, Black can play b3b8+ winning the rook\n- If White doesn't move the king, Black can play b3b8+ followed by a3c3 winning the rook\n- Other moves either don't attack anything or don't maximize Black's active pieces\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is a3b5, putting immediate pressure on White's king.\n\n```\na3b5\n```"
