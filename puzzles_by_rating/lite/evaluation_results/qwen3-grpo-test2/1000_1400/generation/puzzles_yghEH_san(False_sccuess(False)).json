When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's rook and pawns. Material is equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's rook is very active on e3, attacking White's pawn on f4\n- White's rook on d6 is controlling the d-file\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is more active than Black's\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6d8: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- d6g6: Attacks the g5 pawn, but allows Black's rook to capture f4\n- d6e6: Blocks the e3 rook's attack on f4 while maintaining control\n- h4h5: Advances pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f4f5: Pushes pawn but leaves it vulnerable to capture\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6e6 because:\n- It blocks the dangerous e3 rook's attack on f4\n- Maintains control of the d-file\n- Prevents Black from playing ...Rxf4\n- Keeps options open for White's rook\n- Doesn't allow any counterplay for Black\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. d6e6 is the most solid move that maintains White's advantage.\n\n```\nd6e6\n```"
