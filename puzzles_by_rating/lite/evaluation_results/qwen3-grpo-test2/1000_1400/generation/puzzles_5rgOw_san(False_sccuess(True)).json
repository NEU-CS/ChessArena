When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is down a knight.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on g7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White has a knight on d6 that's very strong\n- Black's queen on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on c6\n\n3. The only legal move is d7d6 (king moves from d7 to d6). Let's see what happens after this:\n- It gets the king away from the e7 square where it could be checked by White's queen\n- It maintains the pawn structure in front of the king\n- It prevents any potential discovered checks from White's bishop on c4\n- It keeps the king closer to the center where it might be more active\n\n4. Alternatives:\n- There are no other legal moves - all other pieces are pinned or blocked\n- The pawn on c6 can't move as it's blocked by the queen\n- The bishop on c8 is blocked by pawns\n\nThis is a forced move as there are no other legal options. The king must move to d6 to avoid potential threats.\n\n```\nd7d6\n```"
