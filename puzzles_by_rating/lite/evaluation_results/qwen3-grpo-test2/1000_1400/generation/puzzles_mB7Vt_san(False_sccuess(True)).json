When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count:\n- White has: Bishop, Rook, Rook, Pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Pawns\n- Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two rooks vs black's rook and bishop)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f5\n- White has a passed pawn on h4 that could be dangerous\n- Black's bishop on g4 is very active\n- White's rook on d5 is controlling the fifth rank\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- f5g6: Moves king towards center but away from potential checks. Allows White to play h5 pushing the passed pawn.\n- f5f4: Moves king towards the passed h-pawn but also blocks the bishop's diagonal. White could play h5 anyway.\n- f5e4: Moves king towards the center and away from the h-pawn. Keeps the bishop's diagonal open.\n\n4. Best move is f5e4 because:\n- Gets the king to a safer square\n- Maintains the bishop's diagonal control\n- Prevents White from playing h5 immediately (as f4 would be needed)\n- Keeps options to move the king towards the center or back rank\n\nThe move f5e4 is the most flexible and safest choice, maintaining Black's defensive resources while not creating any weaknesses.\n\n```\nf5e4\n```"
