When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong bishop on f4 controlling important squares\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's queen on f8 is somewhat restricted by pawns\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's knight on d6 is under pressure from White's bishop\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n- f8e8: Centralizes queen but blocks the rook\n- e7f6: Attacks the strong bishop on f4\n- d6e4: Centralizes knight and attacks f2 pawn\n- b7c6: Develops bishop and attacks d5 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7f6:\n- Directly challenges White's strong bishop\n- If Bf4 moves, Black can play Qf8-e7 targeting e4 square\n- If Bf4 takes e6, Black can recapture with d6xe4\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Keeps options open for the queen and rook\n\nOther moves either don't address the bishop or are too passive. e7f6 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\ne7f6\n```"
