When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and knight vs White's bishop and knight, so material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on d4 is very active\n- White's king is exposed after castling\n- Black has a bishop on b4 pinning the knight on c3\n- White's bishop on d3 is blocked by its own pawn on c3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4e4: Centralizing the queen and attacking the bishop on d3\n- b4c3: Capturing the pinned knight\n- d4d3: Capturing the bishop\n- e8g8: Castling to safety\n\n4. Evaluating the best move:\n- b4c3 seems tempting but after Nxc3, Black's queen is exposed\n- d4d3 wins a bishop but allows White to play Qxd3\n- d4e4 is strong as it maintains the pin and threatens to win material\n- e8g8 is safe but doesn't address the active pieces\n\nThe best move is d4e4, centralizing the queen while maintaining the pin on the c3 knight. This puts maximum pressure on White's position and threatens to win material next move.\n\n```\nd4e4\n```"
