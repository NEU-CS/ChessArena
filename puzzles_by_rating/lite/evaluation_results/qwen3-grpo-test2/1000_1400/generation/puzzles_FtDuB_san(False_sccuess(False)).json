When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight, bishop and pawns. Black is down a minor piece.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on c6 that's very dangerous\n- Black's bishop on d4 is active but could be trapped\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White's king is on e2, also exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4e5: Bishop takes pawn, but after Bxe5 White's passed pawn becomes even stronger\n- d4c5: Attacks the dangerous c6 pawn, but White can defend it\n- d4e3: Checks the king, but White can take the bishop\n- h8g8: Rook move that doesn't accomplish much\n- e7f8: King moves away from potential checks\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4c5:\n- It directly attacks the dangerous c6 pawn\n- If White takes the bishop (Bxc5), Black can play b6b5 attacking the pawn\n- If White defends the pawn, Black maintains pressure\n- It's the most active move in the position\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or allow White to consolidate. d4c5 is the most forcing move.\n\n```\nd4c5\n```"
