When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on c5\n- White's king is exposed on h3\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3 that could be dangerous\n- White's queen on g8 is far from the action\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- e6e7: Moves king towards center but doesn't accomplish much\n- e6d7: Moves king away from potential checks but blocks queen's defense of c3 pawn\n- e6d6: Centralizes king and defends c5 queen\n- e6f5: Most active, brings king towards white's king and pawns\n\n4. Best move is e6f5 because:\n- It centralizes the king\n- Prepares to attack white's pawns on f4 and g3\n- Gets the king closer to white's exposed king\n- Maintains defense of c5 queen\n- Creates potential for future checks against white's king\n\nThe other moves either don't improve the position or have drawbacks. e6f5 is the most active and purposeful move.\n\n```\ne6f5\n```"
