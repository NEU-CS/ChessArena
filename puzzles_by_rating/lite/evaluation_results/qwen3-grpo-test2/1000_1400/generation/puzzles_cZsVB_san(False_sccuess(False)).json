When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and rook vs White's pawn and knight. Black is up material but White has some counterplay with the passed d-pawn.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's d-pawn is passed and dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed\n- White's knight on c4 is very active\n- Black's rook on d3 is tied to defending against the d-pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6f4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the g2 pawn\n- d3d7: Moves the rook to defend the 7th rank\n- g5g4: Advances the king to attack the g3 pawn\n- d3d4: Blocks the passed pawn but allows Nc4xd4\n\n4. Best move seems to be e6f4:\n- Attacks the g2 pawn which is unprotected\n- If White takes the knight (Nxf4), Black can play d3d4 blocking the pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with g5g4 increasing pressure\n- Maintains flexibility for the rook\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or don't create immediate threats. e6f4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\ne6f4\n```"
