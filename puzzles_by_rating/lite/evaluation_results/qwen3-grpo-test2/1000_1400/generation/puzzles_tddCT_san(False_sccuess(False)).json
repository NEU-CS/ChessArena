White is down material (approx -5 points).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a strong passed pawn on h3\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's queen and rook are active\n- White's knight on c5 is well placed but isolated\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n- g1g2: Moves king towards center but still leaves it exposed\n- g1h1: Moves king to corner, which is generally unsafe\n- g1f1: Moves king towards relative safety behind pawns\n\n4. Best choice is g1f1 because:\n- Gets the king away from potential checks\n- Moves towards the relative safety of the pawns\n- Doesn't walk into any immediate threats\n- Maintains flexibility to move to e2 if needed\n\nThe other moves either leave the king exposed or put it in a worse position. g1f1 is the most prudent choice in this difficult position.\n\n```\ng1f1\n```"

Key features of the position:\n- Black has a rook on f3 attacking White's queen on d2\n- Black has a knight on h3 threatening to capture White's pawn on g2\n- White's knight on c5 is well placed but can't defend everything\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f1g2: Moves the king towards the center but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- f1e2: Moves the king away from potential checks but still leaves threats\n- d2f2: Moves the queen to safety while attacking the rook on f3\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- d2f2 is the most active move as it:\n  * Gets the queen to safety\n  * Attacks the rook on f3\n  * Maintains control of key squares\n  * After Qxf3, White can try to activate the knight\n- The other king moves don't address the immediate threats and allow Black to maintain pressure\n\n5. Conclusion: d2f2 is the best move as it actively defends while maintaining some counterplay.\n\n```\nd2f2\n```"
