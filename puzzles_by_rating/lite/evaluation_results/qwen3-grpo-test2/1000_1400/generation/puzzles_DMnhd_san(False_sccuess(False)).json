When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is more active (d4 vs f5)\n- White has a passed pawn on b6\n- Black has a passed pawn on e5\n- Both sides have pawns that can promote\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f5g6: Moves king towards black's pawns but away from white's passed pawn\n- f5f6: Keeps king near white's passed pawn but doesn't address black's e-pawn\n- f5e6: Centralizes king, attacking black's e5 pawn while maintaining control of white's b-pawn\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- f5e6 is the most active move, centralizing the king and putting pressure on black's e5 pawn\n- After f5e6, if black defends e5 with ...d3, white can push b6-b7\n- If black doesn't defend, white can capture e5 pawn\n- Other moves either don't address both passed pawns or move away from key action\n\nThe best move is:\n```\nf5e6\n```"
