When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and rook vs White's bishop and knight. Material is roughly equal, but Black has a more active queen and better pawn structure.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed after castling\n- Black's queen is very active on e4\n- White's bishop on b5 is strong but can be challenged\n- Black's f5 knight is well placed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4c2: Queen takes pawn, but White can play Bxc2\n- e4d3: Queen checks, but White can block with Nxd3\n- e4f3: Queen checks, but White can play Kd1\n- f5h4: Knight move attacking g2 pawn\n- e4h4: Queen move attacking h2 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4h4:\n- Attacks the h2 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If White takes the queen (g2xh4), Black can play Qxh4+ winning the bishop on b5\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with Qh5+ or Qg4+\n- Maintains all of Black's threats while increasing pressure\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White to consolidate. e4h4 is the most forcing and dangerous move.\n\n```\ne4h4\n```"
