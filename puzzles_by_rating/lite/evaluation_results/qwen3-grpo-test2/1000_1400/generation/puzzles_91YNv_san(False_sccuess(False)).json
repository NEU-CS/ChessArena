When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is more active in the center\n- White's king is on f2, somewhat restricted\n- Black has a passed h-pawn that's advanced to h3\n- White has a passed a-pawn on a4\n- Black's a-pawn on a5 is blocked by White's a4 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e6: Moves king towards center but away from both pawns\n- d5d6: Moves king forward but doesn't accomplish much\n- d5c6: Moves king towards a-pawn but leaves h-pawn\n- d5e5: Centralizes king and prepares to support h-pawn\n- d5c5: Moves king towards a-pawn\n- d5d4: Moves king forward but doesn't help\n- d5c4: Captures White's a4 pawn! This is very tempting\n- h3h2: Advances passed pawn but allows White to capture it\n\n4. Best move is d5c4:\n- Captures White's a4 pawn, eliminating White's passed pawn\n- After Kxc4, Black can push h3-h2 and promote the h-pawn\n- White's king is too far to stop both the h-pawn and potential a-pawn advances\n- Even if White tries to stop the h-pawn, Black can create a new passed a-pawn\n\nThis is a clear winning move as it eliminates White's counterplay while maintaining Black's own passed pawn.\n\n```\nd5c4\n```"
