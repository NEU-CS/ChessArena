When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, knight, pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on e2 is very active\n- White's queen on d3 is exposed\n- Black has a passed pawn on f4\n- White's knight on f6 is pinned to the king by Black's rook\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2e3: Capturing the queen would be great, but White can play Qxe3 and Black doesn't have enough compensation\n- e2e4: Attacks the queen while maintaining the pin\n- d5e3: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n- g6e5: Moves the knight to a more active square\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2e4:\n- Maintains the pin on the f6 knight\n- Attacks the queen\n- If queen moves, Black can play d5e3 winning material\n- If White plays Qxe4, Black can play d5e3+ winning the knight on f6\n\nOther moves either don't attack the queen or don't maintain the pin. e2e4 is the most forcing move that maintains Black's active pieces while creating threats.\n\n```\ne2e4\n```"
