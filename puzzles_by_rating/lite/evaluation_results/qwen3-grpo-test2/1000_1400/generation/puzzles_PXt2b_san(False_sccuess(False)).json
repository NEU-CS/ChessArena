When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal (rook ~5, pawn ~1, knight ~3).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f5\n- White's rook is very active on d6\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on d2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6d8: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- d6h6: Attacks the king, but allows ...d3\n- d6f6: Checks the king, but allows ...Kxf6\n- d6d5: Blocks the passed pawn, but allows ...Nxd5\n- d2e2: Moves king towards center, but doesn't address threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6d5:\n- Blocks the dangerous passed pawn\n- If Black takes the rook with ...Nxd5, White can play Kc3 attacking the knight\n- If Black doesn't take, White can maintain pressure\n- Keeps the rook active and controls key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or allow Black to push the pawn. d6d5 is the most principled move.\n\n```\nd6d5\n```"
