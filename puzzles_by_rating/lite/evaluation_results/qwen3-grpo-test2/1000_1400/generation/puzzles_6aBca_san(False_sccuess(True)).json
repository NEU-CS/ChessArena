When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on e4\n- White's king is exposed on f2\n- Black has a knight on g4 attacking f2\n- White has a knight on d5 that could be dangerous\n- Black's rook on f8 is pointing at White's king\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n- f2g3: Moves the king towards the center but still leaves it exposed to checks\n- f2g1: Moves the king to a safer square behind pawns\n\n4. Threats to consider:\n- Black could play Qe4f3+ winning the rook on d3\n- Black could play Qe4e1+ winning the bishop on c1\n- The knight on g4 is very dangerous\n\n5. Best move is f2g1 because:\n- Gets the king to safety behind pawns\n- Avoids potential checks\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics from Black\n\nThe move f2g3 would leave the king more exposed to checks and attacks.\n\n```\nf2g1\n```"
