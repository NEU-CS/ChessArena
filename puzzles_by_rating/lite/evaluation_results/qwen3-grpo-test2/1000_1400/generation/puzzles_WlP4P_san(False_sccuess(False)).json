When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop, pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on e2\n- White's queen is exposed on f5\n- Black has a passed pawn on h4\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black's rook on f8 is semi-trapped\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2h5: Attacks the queen and threatens to win material\n- e2g4: Checks the king, but White can block with Bg3\n- h4g3: Captures a pawn but allows White to defend\n- c2c4: Centralizes the rook but doesn't create threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2h5:\n- It attacks the queen directly\n- If White moves the queen, Black can play h4g3 winning a pawn\n- If White takes the queen (Qxh5), Black can play h4h3 creating a passed pawn\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow White to consolidate. e2h5 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\ne2h5\n```"
