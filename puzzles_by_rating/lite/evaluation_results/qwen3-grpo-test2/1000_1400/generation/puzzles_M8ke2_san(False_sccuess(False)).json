When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen is very active on c6\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on f5 that could be advanced\n- Black's bishop on c8 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6e8: Queen checks the king, but Black can block with ...Qe7\n- c6d7: Attacks the rook on f7, but Black can move it\n- f5e6: Advances the passed pawn, but allows ...Bxe6\n- e1e6: Centralizes the rook and attacks the d5 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1e6 because:\n- It centralizes the rook\n- Attacks the weak d5 pawn\n- Prepares to double rooks on the e-file\n- If Black takes the rook with ...Bxe6, White can play Qc6e8+ winning the queen\n- If Black doesn't take, White can push f5-f6 creating more threats\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. e1e6 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\ne1e6\n```"
