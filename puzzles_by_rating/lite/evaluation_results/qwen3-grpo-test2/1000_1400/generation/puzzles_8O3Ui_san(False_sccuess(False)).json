When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and queen vs Black's knight and queen. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White has a bishop on b5 pinning the knight on c6\n- Black has a knight on g4 attacking f2\n- White's queen on f3 is very active\n- Black's queen on d7 is somewhat restricted\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5c6: Capturing the pinned knight, but Black can recapture with the queen\n- f4c7: Bishop takes pawn, but doesn't accomplish much\n- f3d5: Centralizing the queen and attacking the knight on g4\n- e1g1: Castling to safety\n- h3g4: Capturing the knight on g4\n\n4. Best move seems to be h3g4:\n- Removes the annoying knight that's attacking f2\n- Opens the h-file for White's rook\n- After Nxf2, White can play Qxf2 maintaining material equality but with better piece activity\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Qxg4 next move\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or miss opportunities to improve White's position. h3g4 is the most forcing and improves White's position the most.\n\n```\nh3g4\n```"
