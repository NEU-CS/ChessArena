When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and rook vs White's queen and bishop. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active king position.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h8 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White has a passed pawn on a3 that could be dangerous\n- Black's bishop on c7 is blocked by its own pawn on b7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7c8: Moves the bishop to a safer square but doesn't address the queen\n- b7c6: Opens the bishop's diagonal and attacks the queen\n- f6f7: Moves the queen to defend the king\n- e6e5: Advances the pawn to gain space\n\n4. Best move seems to be b7c6 because:\n- It opens the bishop's diagonal to attack the queen\n- After Qh8d4 (forced), Black can play Bc6e4 winning the bishop\n- Even if White doesn't take, Black gains time by attacking the queen\n- It's the most active move that creates immediate threats\n\nOther moves either don't address the queen's activity or don't create threats. b7c6 is the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\nb7c6\n```"
