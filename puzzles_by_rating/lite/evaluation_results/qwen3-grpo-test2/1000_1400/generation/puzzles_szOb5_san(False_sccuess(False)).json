When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on d5\n- White's queen on c8 is very active\n- Black's queen on b6 is defending the king\n- White has a passed pawn on h3 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c5d6: Moves king towards center but exposes it to checks\n- c5b5: Moves king towards safety but away from action\n- c5b4: Moves king towards passed pawn but very exposed\n- b6c7: Moves queen to defend king but allows Qc8xc7\n- b6c6: Keeps queen active and defends king\n- d5c7: Moves king towards safety but allows Qc8xb7\n\n4. Best move is b6c6 because:\n- It keeps the queen active and defending the king\n- It prevents Qc8xb7 which would win a pawn\n- It maintains control over key squares\n- It doesn't expose the king to checks\n- It keeps options open for both king and queen\n\nThe move b6c6 maintains the balance while keeping all pieces active and safe.\n\n```\nb6c6\n```"
