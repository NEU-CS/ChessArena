When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has pawns on a4, b3, c4, d5.\n\n2. King positions:\n- Black king is on f4\n- White king is on h3\nBlack's king is more active and centralized.\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- The c4 pawn is blocked by Black's c5 pawn\n- The b3 pawn is blocked by Black's b6 pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- f4g5: Moves king towards center but away from key pawns\n- f4f5: Advances king but doesn't accomplish much\n- f4e5: Centralizes king and attacks d5 pawn\n- f4e4: Moves king towards queenside but away from action\n- f4f3: Moves king towards white king but not useful\n- f4e3: Moves king away from action\n- b6b5: Advances pawn but allows white to play c4c5\n\nThe best move is f4e5 because:\n1. It centralizes the king\n2. It attacks the important d5 pawn\n3. It prepares to support the a5 passed pawn\n4. It limits white's options as the king can't stay on h3\n\n```\nf4e5\n```"
