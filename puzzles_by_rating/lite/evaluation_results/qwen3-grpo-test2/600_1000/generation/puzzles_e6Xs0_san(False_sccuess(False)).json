When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's queen, rook and pawns. Black is up in material.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on e1\n- Black's rook on c2 is threatening White's pawns\n- White's rook on e4 is active but could be vulnerable\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- White has a passed pawn on a5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4e8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- e4e7: Attacks the f7 pawn, but Black can defend\n- e4e6: Blocks the g6 king's escape, but allows Qe1e2+\n- e4h4: Attacks the h5 pawn, but Black can play Qe1e2+\n- a5a6: Advances the passed pawn, but it's not clear if it's dangerous\n- g3g4: Creates a passed pawn and opens lines\n\n4. Best move seems to be g3g4:\n- Creates a passed pawn that could be dangerous\n- Opens the g-file for the rook\n- If Black takes (hxg4), White can play Rxe1 winning the queen\n- If Black doesn't take, the pawn can advance\n- It's the most active move that creates counterplay\n\nThe move g3g4 is the most forcing and creates immediate threats that Black must address.\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
