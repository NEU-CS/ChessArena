When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and queen vs White's queen, rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on g5\n- White's queen on d3 is defending the rook on d2\n- Black's bishop on c5 is controlling important squares\n- White's king is exposed on g2\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5e3: Queen takes pawn, but White can play Qxe3\n- g5d2: Queen takes rook, but White can play Qxd2\n- g5f4: Centralizing queen, attacking g3 pawn\n- c5e3: Bishop takes pawn, but White can play Qxe3\n- d8d5: Rook moves to open file, but doesn't accomplish much\n\n4. Best move seems to be g5f4:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the g3 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If White takes the queen (Qxf4), Black can play Bf2+ winning the rook on d2\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with Qf2+ or other threats\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and active move, creating immediate threats while maintaining all of Black's pieces in good positions.\n\n```\ng5f4\n```"
