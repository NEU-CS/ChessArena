When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d8\n- Black's queen on e5 is centralized but could be vulnerable\n- Black's rook on e7 is controlling the e-file\n- White's rook on g3 is active but can be challenged\n- Black has passed pawns on c5 and b5\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g7f7: Moves king towards center but exposes it to checks\n- g7h6: Moves king towards corner, not ideal\n- e5g5: Attacks the rook on g3, forcing it to move\n- e5g3: Captures the rook, but allows Qd8e7+ winning the exchange\n\n4. Best move is e5g5:\n- Attacks the rook on g3\n- If Rg3 moves, Black can play Qg5e3+ winning the f2 pawn\n- If White doesn't move the rook, Black can capture it next move\n- Maintains material balance while keeping initiative\n\nThe move e5g5 is most forcing and maintains Black's active play.\n\n```\ne5g5\n```"
