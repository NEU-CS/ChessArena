When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, queen, knight and pawns. White is down material but has some compensation with active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on h5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's queen on e7 is blocking the rook on c8\n- White's bishop on c4 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h7: Rook check, but Black can block with Qe7-h7\n- c4f7: Bishop takes pawn with check, but Black can play Qe7-f7\n- g3e5: Queen takes pawn, but Black can play Qe7-e5\n- c4d5: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Qe7-d6\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5h7:\n- It's a check that forces Black to react\n- After Qe7-h7, White can play Bc4-f7 winning a pawn\n- Even if Black finds a better defense, White maintains initiative\n- It's the most forcing move in the position\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow Black to consolidate. The check with h5h7 is the most disruptive.\n\n```\nh5h7\n```"
