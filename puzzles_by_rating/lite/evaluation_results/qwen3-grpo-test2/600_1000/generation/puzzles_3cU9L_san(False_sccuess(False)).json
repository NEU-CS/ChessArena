When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White has passed pawns on d6 and e6 that could be dangerous\n- Black's rook is active on g4\n- Black's knight on e4 is very centralized\n- White's king is exposed on f1\n- Black's king is on e8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f6: Attacks the e6 pawn but allows White to push d6-d7\n- e4d6: Captures the dangerous d6 pawn\n- g4g5: Pushes the pawn but doesn't address the passed pawns\n- e4g3: Checks the king but White can just move away\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4d6:\n- It eliminates White's dangerous passed pawn\n- After Nxd6, Black can play Rg4-g5+ winning the e6 pawn\n- White can't defend both pawns\n- Even if White tries Kf1-e2, Black can continue with Rg5-e5+ winning the last pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawns or allow White to advance them. e4d6 is the most forcing and decisive move.\n\n```\ne4d6\n```"
