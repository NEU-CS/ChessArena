When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on g5\n- White's queen on c2 is under attack by Black's bishop on d3\n- Black has a passed pawn on d6\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c2c6: Captures the pawn but allows Qxc6\n- c2d3: Captures the bishop, but Qxd3\n- c2e2: Moves queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n- e1e4: Centralizes the king and attacks the queen\n- b1c3: Develops the knight and defends d5\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1e4:\n- Centralizes the king which is important in endgames\n- Attacks Black's active queen\n- If Black moves queen, we can play Qxd3 winning the bishop\n- If Black takes our queen (Qxe4), we can play Qxd3 with a material advantage\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't improve our position as much. e1e4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\ne1e4\n```"
