When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's bishop on e6 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on c6\n- White has a passed pawn on e4\n- Black's knight on d5 is under attack by White's bishop\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- c6d6: Moves king away from center but still leaves knight hanging\n- c6b6: Moves king towards corner, but doesn't solve knight issue\n- c6b5: Moves king towards corner and attacks e4 pawn\n- d8d5: Captures the knight with queen, but allows Bxd5 winning material\n- e7d5: Captures the knight with knight, maintaining material balance\n\n4. Best move is e7d5 because:\n- It captures the knight while maintaining material equality\n- After Bxd5, Black can play Qxd5 and the position remains balanced\n- Other king moves don't address the immediate threat to the knight\n- It's the most active move, developing the knight to a central square\n\nThe move e7d5 solves the problem of the hanging knight while maintaining a balanced position.\n\n```\ne7d5\n```"
