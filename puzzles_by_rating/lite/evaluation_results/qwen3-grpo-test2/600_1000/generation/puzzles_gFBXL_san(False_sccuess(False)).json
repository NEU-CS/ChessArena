When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g5 is very active\n- White's knight on h5 is under attack by Black's queen\n- White's bishop on f3 is blocked by its own pawn on d3\n- Black has a passed pawn on a2 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5g7: Knight moves to g7, attacking the rook on e7\n- b4b7: Queen moves to b7, attacking the a2 pawn\n- f3b7: Bishop moves to b7, defending the a2 pawn\n- a1d4: Rook moves to d4, centralizing and attacking the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5g7:\n- It saves the knight while attacking Black's rook\n- After h5g7, if Black takes the knight (Qxg7), White can play Qb7 attacking the a2 pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure on the rook\n- It's more forcing than other options and creates immediate threats\n\nOther moves like b4b7 or f3b7 are defensive and don't create threats. a1d4 is interesting but doesn't address the immediate knight situation.\n\n```\nh5g7\n```"
