When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on h4\n- White's queen on a8 is trapped and needs to find a way out\n- Black has a bishop on g4 controlling important squares\n- White's king is still in the center\n- Black's king is on e7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a8g8: Gets the queen out but allows Qxg8\n- a8e4: Centralizes the queen but allows Qxe4\n- g2b7: Bishop move that attacks the a8 queen but allows Qxb7\n- g1f3: Develops the knight and blocks the queen's path\n\n4. Best move seems to be g1f3 because:\n- It develops a piece\n- Blocks the queen's path to g8\n- Prepares to castle kingside\n- If Black takes the knight (Qxf3), White can play Qe4+ winning the bishop on g4\n- If Black doesn't take, White can safely move the queen next move\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't improve White's position as much. g1f3 is the most active and flexible move.\n\n```\ng1f3\n```"
