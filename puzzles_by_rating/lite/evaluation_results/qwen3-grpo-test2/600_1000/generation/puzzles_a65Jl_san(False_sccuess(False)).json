When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's bishop is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on b6 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on f5\n- Black's bishop on d5 is controlling important squares\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on e2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6b8: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- b6e6: Rook checks the king, but Black can just take the rook with Bxe6\n- b6d6: Rook attacks the bishop, but Black can play Bc4 defending\n- e2e3: King moves towards center but exposes to checks\n- f3f4: Pushes pawn but weakens e4 square\n- a3a4: Pushes pawn but doesn't accomplish much\n\n4. Best move seems to be b6d6:\n- Attacks the bishop directly\n- If Black moves bishop (Bc4), then Rxd5 wins a piece\n- If Black takes rook (Bxd6), then Kxd5 wins the bishop\n- If Black does nothing, we can follow up with Rxd5 next move\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and advantageous move, winning material in all lines.\n\n```\nb6d6\n```"
