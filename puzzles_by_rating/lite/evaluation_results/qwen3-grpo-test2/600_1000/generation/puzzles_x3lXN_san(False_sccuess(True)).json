When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but Black has a more active rook on e8 and a dangerous passed pawn on c5.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's bishop on h2 is very active, attacking White's rook on e2\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's queen on d6 is eyeing the f4 square\n- White's knight on a4 is blocked by its own pawn on b4\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g1h1: Moves the king away from potential checks but leaves the rook on e2 hanging to the bishop\n- g1f1: Moves the king towards the center but still leaves the rook hanging\n\n4. Consequences:\n- Both moves lose the rook on e2 to Bxe2\n- After Bxe2, White can play Qf3 attacking the bishop, but Black can play Qe5 defending\n- The position remains complicated but White loses material\n\n5. Best approach:\n- Both moves lead to material loss\n- g1h1 at least moves the king to a safer square\n- g1f1 leaves the king more exposed to potential checks\n\nThe lesser evil is g1h1, as it moves the king to a safer square while the other option leaves it more exposed. Although material is lost, g1h1 is the more resilient move.\n\n```\ng1h1\n```"
