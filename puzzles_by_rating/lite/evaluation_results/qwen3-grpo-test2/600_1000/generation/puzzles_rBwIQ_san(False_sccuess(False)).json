When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a knight on h3 attacking g1 (but it's protected by the rook)\n- Black's bishop on e6 is very active\n- White's bishop on b3 is blocked by pawns\n- White's knight on g3 is under attack by Black's pawn on h5\n- White's queen on c2 is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3h5: Captures the pawn but allows Black to play ...Bxg3\n- g3f5: Moves the knight to a safer square while maintaining pressure\n- c2g6: Attacks the bishop on e6, but Black can just move it\n- e1e6: Captures the bishop, but Black can play ...Nf5 attacking the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be g3f5 because:\n- It saves the knight from capture\n- It maintains pressure on Black's position\n- It doesn't allow any immediate counterplay\n- It keeps options open for White's pieces\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow Black to gain the initiative. g3f5 is the most solid move that maintains White's position.\n\n```\ng3f5\n```"
