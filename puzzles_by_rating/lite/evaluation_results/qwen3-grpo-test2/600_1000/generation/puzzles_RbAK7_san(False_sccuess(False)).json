When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Black is down a knight but has a passed pawn on b2 that can promote.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's b2 pawn is one square from promotion\n- White's king is exposed on d2\n- Black's bishop on e4 is very active\n- White's knight on h4 is awkwardly placed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2b1q: Promoting the pawn immediately. However, White can play Rg3 attacking the bishop and defending the promotion square.\n- e4f3: Capturing the knight, but White can play Rg3 attacking the bishop.\n- e4h1: Bishop move attacking the rook, but White can just move the rook.\n\n4. Best move seems to be b2b1q:\n- After b2b1q, if White plays Rg3, Black can play Bf3 attacking the rook and defending the queen\n- If White doesn't take the queen, Black has a decisive material advantage\n- The promotion is too strong to ignore, as White can't effectively stop it\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow White to maintain defenses. The immediate promotion is the most forcing and winning move.\n\n```\nb2b1q\n```"
