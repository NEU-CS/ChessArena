When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on h4, attacking g3 and h2\n- White's queen is on d5, controlling important squares\n- Black has a rook on e3, pinning the f2 king to the g2 pawn\n- White's king is exposed on f2\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f2g1: Moves king away from pin but exposes it to checks\n- f2f1: Moves king to safety but still leaves g3 vulnerable\n- g2g3: Captures the dangerous h4 queen\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- g2g3 is the most forcing move, capturing the queen\n- After g2g3, black can recapture with hxg3, but then white can play Qxh5 winning the bishop\n- Other moves allow black to maintain the attack with Qxg3+ winning material\n\nThe best move is to capture the queen immediately:\n\n```\ng2g3\n```"
