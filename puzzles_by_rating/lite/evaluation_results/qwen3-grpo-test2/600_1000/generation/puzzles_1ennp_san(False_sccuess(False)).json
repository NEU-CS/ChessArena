When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on b4 is very active\n- Black's bishop on g7 controls important squares\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g7\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h1g1: Gets the king to safer square but seems passive\n- c1c6: Attacks the c6 pawn but allows Black to play ...Rb4d4\n- d4d5: Advances the passed pawn but allows ...Rb4d4\n- f3f4: Creates a passed pawn but weakens e4\n- h2h4: Prepares h4h5 to create counterplay\n\n4. Best move seems to be h2h4:\n- Prepares h4h5 to create a passed pawn\n- Limits Black's rook mobility by controlling g5\n- If Black takes the d4 pawn with ...Rb4d4, White can play h4h5 creating counterplay\n- Maintains flexibility for other pieces\n\nThe move h2h4 is the most active and creates long-term counterplay while not weakening White's position.\n\n```\nh2h4\n```"
