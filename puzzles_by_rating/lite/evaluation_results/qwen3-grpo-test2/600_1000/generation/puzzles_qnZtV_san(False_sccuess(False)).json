When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's queen is very active on e3\n- Black has a passed pawn on b4\n- White has a passed pawn on a2\n- Black's queen on d6 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3e8: Queen check, but Black can block with rook\n- e3h6: Attacks the f6 pawn and threatens to win material\n- e3e6: Centralizes queen and attacks d6 queen\n- c1c4: Targets the b4 passed pawn\n- b1c2: Defends a2 pawn and prepares to activate rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3h6:\n- Directly attacks the f6 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If Black takes the queen (g7xh6), White can play Qxh6+ winning the f7 pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can win the f6 pawn next move\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. e3h6 is the most forcing and disruptive move.\n\n```\ne3h6\n```"
