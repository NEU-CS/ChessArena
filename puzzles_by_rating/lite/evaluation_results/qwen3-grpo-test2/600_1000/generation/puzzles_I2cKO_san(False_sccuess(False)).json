When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h8 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- Black's queen on f7 is under attack by White's bishop on g4\n- Black's knight on g5 is pinned to the king by White's bishop\n- Black's rook on f2 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: Moves queen to safety but allows White to play Qh8g7+ winning the rook\n- f7e7: Moves queen to safety while maintaining control\n- g5e6: Unpins the knight but allows Qh8g7+ winning the rook\n- f2f6: Moves rook but doesn't address the queen issue\n- f7f6: Moves queen to safety while attacking the bishop\n\n4. Best move seems to be f7f6:\n- Gets the queen out of attack\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- After Qh8g7+, Black can play Kd8 and the rook is safe\n- Keeps the knight pinned which is important for defense\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. f7f6 is the most solid choice.\n\n```\nf7f6\n```"
