When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on d4 is very active\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning the knight on f3\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on a2 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4c8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- d6f4: Bishop takes knight, but Qxf4 allows White's queen to stay active\n- d8h4: Queen move attacking the pinned knight, but White can just move it\n- e8e4: King move centralizing, but exposes to checks\n- d6e5: Bishop move attacking the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6e5:\n- Attacks White's active queen on d4\n- If Qxe5, then Bxf3 wins a piece\n- If Q moves away, Black gains time\n- Maintains the pin on the knight\n- Opens diagonal for Black's queen\n\nOther moves either don't address White's active queen or are too passive. d6e5 is the most forcing move that improves Black's position.\n\n```\nd6e5\n```"
