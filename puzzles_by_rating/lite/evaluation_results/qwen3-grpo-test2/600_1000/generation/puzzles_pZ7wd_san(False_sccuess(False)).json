When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and queen vs White's knight and queen. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on d5 that could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on d5 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- Black's queen on g6 is active but could be vulnerable\n- Black's bishop on f8 is blocked by pawns\n- White has a potential threat of Qd3-h3+ in some lines\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g6e8: Centralizes the queen but blocks the bishop\n- g6f7: Keeps queen active while defending f5 pawn\n- f8e7: Develops the bishop and connects rooks\n- d8e8: Moves the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be f8e7 because:\n- Develops the bishop to a active diagonal\n- Connects the rooks\n- Prepares to double rooks on the d-file\n- Maintains flexibility for the queen\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't improve piece activity or could create vulnerabilities. For example, moving the queen (g6e8/g6f7) allows White to play Qd3-h3+ with tempo.\n\n```\nf8e7\n```"
