When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on g5 is very dangerous, eyeing the h4 pawn and potential checks\n- White's rook on f7 is active but could be trapped\n- White's bishop on e5 is blocked by its own pawn on d4\n- Black's king is exposed on c8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5h8: Bishop retreat, but allows Qxh4\n- e5g7: Bishop blocks the queen's diagonal, but Qxh4 still possible\n- e2h5: Queen takes queen, but after Qxh5 White's rook is trapped\n- e2g4: Queen takes queen, but Qxg4 allows Rf8+ winning the bishop\n- f7f8: Rook retreat, but Qxh4 is still possible\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2g4:\n- Wins the queen for a queen\n- After Qxg4, Rf8+ wins the bishop on e5\n- Even if Black doesn't take, Qg4 is very strong\n\nThis is the most forcing and winning move, eliminating Black's most dangerous piece while maintaining material equality.\n\n```\ne2g4\n```"
