When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- White's queen on h6 is very active\n- Black has a rook on h3 attacking White's pawn on g2\n- White's bishop on d5 is controlling important squares\n- Black's knight on e5 is well placed\n\n3. The only legal move is g2h3, which captures the rook on h3. Let's see the consequences:\n- After g2h3, Black can play Qd7h3, but then White can play Qh6g5+ winning the knight on e5\n- Black could try Nf7 instead, but then White can play Qh6g5+ Nxg5 Bc4 winning material\n- Black's king would be very exposed after these exchanges\n\n4. Alternative ideas:\n- There are no other legal moves, so we must take the rook\n- Not taking the rook would be a serious mistake as it's hanging\n\nThe move g2h3 is forced and leads to a clear advantage for White as it wins material while keeping the initiative. The rook is simply hanging and must be captured.\n\n```\ng2h3\n```"
