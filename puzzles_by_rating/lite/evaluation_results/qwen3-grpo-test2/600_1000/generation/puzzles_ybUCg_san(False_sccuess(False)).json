When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and pawns vs White's knight and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is more active (g5) while White's king is on g3\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's knight is very active on f6\n- White's knight on f1 is not very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6g8: Retreating the knight, but seems passive\n- f6e8: Similar to g8, too passive\n- f6h7: Attacks the g5 king, but White can just move away\n- f6d7: Centralizes the knight, but doesn't accomplish much\n- f6h5: Attacks the g3 king, but White can defend\n- f6d5: Captures the dangerous d5 pawn! This seems very strong\n- f6g4: Attacks the g3 king, but White can defend\n- f6e4: Centralizes the knight, but doesn't address the d5 pawn\n- g5h6: Moves the king away from center\n- b6b5/a6a5: Pushes pawns but doesn't address immediate concerns\n\n4. The best move is f6d5, capturing the dangerous passed pawn. This:\n- Removes White's most advanced pawn\n- Opens the d-file for Black's rook (if it were on the board)\n- Centralizes the knight\n- After Nxd5, Black can play Kf4 attacking the knight\n\nAll other moves either don't address the immediate threat of the d5 pawn or are too passive.\n\n```\nf6d5\n```"
