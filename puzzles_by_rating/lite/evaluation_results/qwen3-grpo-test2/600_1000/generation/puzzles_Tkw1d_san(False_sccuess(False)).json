When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, R, P, P, P, K\n- Black has: Q, R, B, P, P, P, K\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two rooks vs queen and bishop)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d8 is very active\n- Black's queen on f6 is under attack by White's rook on f5\n- Black's rook on e2 is very active and threatening\n- White's king is exposed on g3\n- Black's king is on h8\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f6f8: Moves queen to safety but allows White to play Rf5e5 winning the bishop\n- f6d8: Captures White's queen but allows Rf5e5 winning the bishop\n- e2e8: Moves rook to e8, maintaining pressure and keeping queen defended\n\n4. Best move is e2e8 because:\n- It maintains the defense of the queen\n- Keeps the active rook on an open file\n- Doesn't allow any immediate captures\n- Maintains all threats against White's position\n- After e2e8, Black can consider Qf6d8 next move to capture the queen\n\nThe other moves either lose material or allow White to gain an advantage.\n\n```\ne2e8\n```"
