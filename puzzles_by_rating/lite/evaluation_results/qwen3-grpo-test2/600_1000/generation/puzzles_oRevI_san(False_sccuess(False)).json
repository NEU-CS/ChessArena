When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's rook and pawns. Material is equal, but White's king is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on f5\n- White's rook on h7 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on b3 that's blocked by Black's pawn on c5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7h8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- h7g7: Centralizes rook but doesn't threaten anything\n- h7e7: Checks the king, but Black can just take the rook\n- h5h6: Advances pawn but doesn't create threats\n- b3b4: Pushes the passed pawn, but Black can respond with c5b4\n- g2g3/g4: Doesn't address immediate concerns\n- a2a3/a4: Could prepare b3b4 but is slow\n\n4. Best move seems to be h7e7+:\n- It's a check that forces Black's king to move\n- After Kf5-e6 (only legal move), White can play b3b4, advancing the passed pawn\n- The rook is then safe on e7 as Black's king can't approach\n\nThis sequence improves White's position by activating the rook and preparing to push the passed pawn.\n\n```\nh7e7\n```"
