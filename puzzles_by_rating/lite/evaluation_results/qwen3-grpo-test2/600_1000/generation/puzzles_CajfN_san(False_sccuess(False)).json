When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's rook on h6 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has a passed pawn on d7 that could be dangerous\n- Black's bishop on e3 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much immediately\n- e4f6: Knight move attacking the king, but Black can defend\n- e4c5: Knight move attacking the b7 pawn\n- g2h3: King move, but seems passive\n- f3f4: Pushing the pawn to gain space\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4c5:\n- Attacks the b7 pawn which is only defended by the rook\n- If Black takes the knight (dxc5), White can play d7d8 promoting the pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with d7d8 anyway\n- Creates threats against Black's position while maintaining pressure\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow Black to consolidate. e4c5 is the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\ne4c5\n```"
