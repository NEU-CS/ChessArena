When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's queen and bishop. Black is up in material (queen vs knight+bishop).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on g6\n- White's knight on g5 is threatening but can be captured by the queen\n- White's bishop on b3 is blocked by pawns\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h7: Knight check, but Black can just take the knight with Qxh7\n- g5f7: Knight check, but Black can play Qxf7\n- b3f7: Bishop check, but Black can play Qxf7\n- d2a5: Queen move attacking the a6 pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g1h2: King move to safety, but seems passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be b3f7:\n- It's a check that forces Black to take the bishop (Qxf7)\n- After Qxf7, White can play Nf6+ winning the queen\n- Even if Black doesn't take the bishop, it's a strong check that disrupts Black's position\n\nThe sequence would be:\n1. Bf7+ Qxf7\n2. Nf6+ winning the queen as Black can't take the knight (king is in check)\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb3f7\n```"
