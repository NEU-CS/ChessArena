When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. White is up material but Black has some compensation with the active rook and bishop.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on e1 is very active\n- White's queen on b6 is exposed\n- Black's bishop on g7 controls important squares\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6b8: Queen retreat, but seems passive\n- b6c7: Attacks the rook, but Black can just move it\n- g2e4: Centralizes the king and attacks the d4 pawn\n- g4g5: Pushes the pawn to create threats\n- b6d6: Centralizes the queen while attacking the d4 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g2e4 because:\n- Centralizes the king safely\n- Attacks the d4 pawn which is a potential weakness\n- Gets the king away from potential checks\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- If Black takes the queen with Rxe4, White can play Qxe4 winning the bishop\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to maintain pressure. g2e4 is the most active and improving move.\n\n```\ng2e4\n```"
