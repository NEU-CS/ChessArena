When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on e5\n- White's bishop on f3 is unprotected\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n- White's king is still in the center\n- Black's king is also uncastled\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f4: Attacks the bishop on f3, but White can just move it\n- e5e4: Centralizes the queen more, but doesn't create threats\n- e5g3: Attacks the bishop and threatens to win it after ...Qxg3\n- e5h2: Interesting, threatening to win the pawn on h2\n- e5f6: Defends the d4 pawn but seems passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5g3:\n- It attacks the bishop on f3\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play ...Qxg3 winning a pawn\n- If White doesn't move the bishop, Black can play ...Qxg3 next move\n- It maintains pressure while developing initiative\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow White to consolidate. e5g3 is the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\ne5g3\n```"
