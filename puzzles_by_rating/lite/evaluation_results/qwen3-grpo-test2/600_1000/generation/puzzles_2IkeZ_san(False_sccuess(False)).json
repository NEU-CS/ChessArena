When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (no pieces captured yet)\n2. Key features:\n   - White has a bishop on c4 attacking f7\n   - Black's king is still in the center\n   - White has a queen on f3 eyeing f7\n   - Black has a pawn on a4 that could be advanced\n   - White has a pawn on e4 controlling d5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - g8f6: Develops knight and defends e4 pawn\n   - f8g7: Develops bishop and prepares to castle\n   - e7e6: Challenges White's central control\n   - a4a3: Advances the a-pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g8f6 because:\n   - Develops a piece actively\n   - Defends the e4 pawn\n   - Prepares to castle kingside\n   - Doesn't create any weaknesses\n   - Other moves either don't develop pieces or create potential weaknesses (like a4a3 which could leave the a-file open)\n\nThe move g8f6 addresses multiple aspects of the position while maintaining flexibility for Black's development.\n\n```\ng8f6\n```"
