When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. White is up a queen for a bishop, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen on b7 is very active\n- Black's queen on d5 is centralized but potentially vulnerable\n- White's knight on e5 is well placed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7c8: Queen takes rook, but allows Black to play ...Qd5c6 attacking the knight\n- e5f7: Knight check, but Black can block with ...Qd5e6\n- e5d7: Knight takes pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- e3e4: Centralizing the rook and attacking the black queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3e4:\n- Attacks the black queen directly\n- If Black moves the queen, White can play Qb7c6+ winning the knight on f6\n- If Black takes the rook with Qd5e4, then Qb7c6+ wins the knight\n- Maintains all of White's advantages while increasing pressure\n\nOther moves either don't maximize the material advantage or allow Black to defend. e3e4 is the most forcing and winning move.\n\n```\ne3e4\n```"
