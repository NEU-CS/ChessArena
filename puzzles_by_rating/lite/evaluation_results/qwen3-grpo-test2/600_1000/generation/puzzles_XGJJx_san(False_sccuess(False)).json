When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and queen vs White's queen and knight. Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on e5 is very strong\n- Black's queen on f2 is attacking White's bishop on g2\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning White's knight on c3 to the king\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f2g1: Capturing the bishop, but White can play Qxg4\n- f2e1: Moving queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n- g4e2: Moving bishop to attack the queen\n- f2f6: Moving queen to attack the knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be f2g1:\n- It wins the bishop immediately\n- After Qxg4, Black can play Bxc3 winning the knight\n- Even if White doesn't take the bishop, Black maintains strong pressure\n- Other moves either don't win material or allow White to consolidate\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is to capture the bishop immediately.\n\n```\nf2g1\n```"
