When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, pawns. Black is down a bishop but has some compensation with the active rook and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on g8 is very active\n- White's rook on c7 is tied to defending the b6 pawn\n- Black's g6 pawn is passed and dangerous\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g6g5: Advances the passed pawn but allows White to play Rb7 attacking the a7 pawn\n- g6g4: More aggressive, threatening to push g3 next move\n- g8g7: Centralizes the rook and prepares to support the g-pawn\n- g8g2: Interesting sacrifice to open lines against the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be g6g4:\n- It's the most aggressive push of the passed pawn\n- If White takes (hxg4), Black can play Rg2+ winning the rook\n- If White doesn't take, Black can push g3 next move\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while creating immediate dangers\n\nThe move g6g4 creates the most problems for White while maintaining all of Black's options. It's the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\ng6g4\n```"
