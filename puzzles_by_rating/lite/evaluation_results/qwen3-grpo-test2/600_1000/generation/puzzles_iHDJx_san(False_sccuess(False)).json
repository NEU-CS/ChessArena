When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a bishop on h6 that's very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a knight on g5 threatening to jump to f7\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on f6\n- White's queen on f4 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h8: Gets the bishop out of danger but seems passive\n- e7g6: Blocks the h6 bishop but allows Nf7+\n- e6f7: Blocks the h6 bishop and covers f7, but allows Qxg5\n- f6g5: Captures the active bishop but allows Nf7+\n\n4. Best move seems to be e6f7:\n- It blocks the dangerous h6 bishop\n- Covers the f7 square against Nf7+ \n- Maintains control of key squares\n- After Qxg5, Black can play Qxg5 and the position remains balanced\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses. e6f7 is the most solid move that maintains Black's defensive structure while keeping options open.\n\n```\ne6f7\n```"
