When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawn vs White's bishop and pawn. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on b4\n- Black has a bishop pair (but one is blocked by pawns)\n- White's queen is very active on d4\n- Black's king is exposed after castling\n- Black's g4 bishop is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8e7: Centralizes the queen and defends the e6 bishop\n- d6e5: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the queen\n- g4h3: Attacks the f1 bishop and threatens to win material\n- d8h4: Checks the king and attacks the b4 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4h3:\n- It attacks the f1 bishop which is unprotected\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play Qd8h4+ winning the b4 pawn\n- If White doesn't move the bishop, Black can play Bxh3 winning a pawn\n- It maintains Black's active piece play\n- It puts pressure on White's position\n\nOther moves like d8e7 or d6e5 are good but don't create immediate threats. g4h3 is the most forcing move that creates concrete problems for White.\n\n```\ng4h3\n```"
