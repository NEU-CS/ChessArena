When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on g5\n- White's queen is on e4, potentially exposed\n- Black's bishop on e6 is controlling important squares\n- White's king is still in the center (e1)\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5e3: Queen takes pawn, but White can play Qxe3\n- g5f4: Queen checks, but White can block with Bf3\n- g5h4: Queen moves to h4, threatening h2 pawn\n- e6d5: Bishop takes pawn, but White can play Qxd5\n- g5g4: Queen moves forward, maintaining pressure\n\n4. Best move seems to be g5h4:\n- Threatens to take the h2 pawn next move\n- If White plays g3, Black can play Qh3+ winning the rook on f1\n- If White plays Qxh4, Black can play Bg4+ winning the queen\n- Maintains all of Black's threats while keeping the initiative\n\nThis move maximizes Black's attacking potential while keeping all options open. It's the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\ng5h4\n```"
