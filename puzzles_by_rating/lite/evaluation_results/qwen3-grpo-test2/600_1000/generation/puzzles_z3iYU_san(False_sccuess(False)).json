When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White's knight on f4 is very active\n- Black's rook on h8 is trapped and needs to find a better square\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the rook out of danger but doesn't improve its activity\n- d8e7: Centralizes the queen and defends the king\n- f5g7: Moves the knight to a safer square while maintaining pressure\n- d6e5: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the d4 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6e5 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks the dangerous d4 pawn\n- If White takes the bishop (d4xe5), Black can play Qd8e7+ winning the f4 knight\n- If White doesn't take, Black can push e6-e5 gaining space\n- It's more active than moving the rook or queen\n\nThe move d6e5 improves Black's position the most by increasing piece activity and putting pressure on White's position.\n\n```\nd6e5\n```"
