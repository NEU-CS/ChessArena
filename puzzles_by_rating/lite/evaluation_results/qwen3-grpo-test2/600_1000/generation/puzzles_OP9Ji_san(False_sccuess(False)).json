When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight, queen and pawns. Black is down a queen for a bishop, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong queen on e4 and bishop on d3\n- Black's queen on c5 is active but potentially exposed\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on a2 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5e3: Capturing the bishop, but after Qxe3 Black's queen is lost\n- c5d4: Centralizing the queen but allows Qxd4\n- c5f2: Checking the king, but White can just take the queen\n- c5c3: Protecting the knight on b4, but doesn't address material deficit\n- e7g5: Developing the bishop and attacking the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7g5:\n- Develops the bishop to a active square\n- Attacks the queen, forcing it to move\n- After Q moves (e.g. Qe2), Black can play Qc3 attacking the bishop\n- Maintains some counterplay despite being material down\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. e7g5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\ne7g5\n```"
