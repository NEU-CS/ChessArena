When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on a5 is eyeing the g1 king\n- White's knight on e7 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's rook on f8 is controlling the f-file\n- White's queen on g4 is active but could be vulnerable\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7g8: Knight check, but Black can take the knight with Qxg8\n- g4c8: Queen takes rook, but Black can play Qxc8\n- g4d7: Queen checks, but Black can block with Qxd7\n- b7b8: Rook moves to safety but doesn't accomplish much\n- g4h5: Queen moves to safety while maintaining pressure\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4h5:\n- Gets the queen to safety away from potential checks\n- Maintains pressure on Black's position\n- Keeps options open for future attacks\n- Doesn't allow any immediate counterplay from Black\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't improve White's position. g4h5 is the most solid and active choice.\n\n```\ng4h5\n```"
