When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, bishop, pawns and rook. Black is down a queen for a rook, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on e4 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- Black's rook on d8 is blocked by the bishop on c8\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n- Black's pawn structure is somewhat compromised\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8d7: Gets the rook out of the bishop's pin but doesn't address the material deficit\n- e7e8: Moves the king to safety but seems passive\n- c6e5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n- c8c7: Develops the bishop and connects rooks\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6e5 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the powerful queen on e4\n- If White takes the knight (Qxe5), Black can play Bb7 developing the bishop\n- If White moves the queen, Black gains time to improve position\n- It's the most active move in a position where Black needs to fight\n\nThe move c6e5 puts immediate pressure on White's position and is the most dynamic option available.\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
