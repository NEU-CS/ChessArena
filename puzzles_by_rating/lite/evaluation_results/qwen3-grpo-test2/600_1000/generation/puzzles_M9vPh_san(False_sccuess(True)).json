When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, R, P, P, P, P\n- Black has: R, Q, P, P, P, P, B\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two rooks vs black's rook and bishop)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White's queen on c7 is very active\n- Black's queen on f4 is attacking white's rook on d1\n- Black's bishop on e5 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n- White has a passed pawn on a5\n\n3. Available move:\nOnly legal move is b8a8 (king moves from b8 to a8)\n\n4. Evaluation of b8a8:\n- Gets the king away from potential checks\n- Moves towards the corner which might be safer\n- Doesn't open any new lines for white's pieces\n- After this move, black can consider activating the rook on d8\n\nThis is the only move available, and it's the safest option as it gets the king to relative safety. There are no immediate threats that require a different response.\n\n```\nb8a8\n```"
