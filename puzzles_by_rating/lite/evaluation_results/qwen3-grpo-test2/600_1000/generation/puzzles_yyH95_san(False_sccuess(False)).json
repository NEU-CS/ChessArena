When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on h3\n- Black's queen on e5 is centralized but exposed\n- Black's rook on e8 is blocked by its own pawn on e6\n- White's rook on b7 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g7g8: Moves king to safety but doesn't address any threats\n- g7f8: Similar to g7g8, just moves king\n- g7g6: Moves king towards center but exposes to checks\n- e8e7: Unblocks rook but allows Qh3e6+ winning the e6 pawn\n- e6e7: Blocks queen's diagonal but allows Rb7e7 winning the e7 pawn\n- e5c7: Moves queen to defend e6 pawn while attacking b7 rook\n\n4. Best move is e5c7 because:\n- Defends the e6 pawn\n- Attacks the active Rb7 rook\n- If Rb7 moves, Qc7 can capture the e6 pawn\n- If Rb7 takes queen, then Kxg6 and Black has counterplay with passed pawns\n\n```\ne5c7\n```"
