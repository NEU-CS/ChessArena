When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and queen vs White's rook, knight and queen. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's rook on e2 is very active\n- White's queen on d4 is exposed\n- Black's bishop on f5 is controlling important squares\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2e4: Attacks the queen and threatens to win material\n- f5d3: Captures the pawn and opens lines\n- f6d4: Captures the queen, but White can recapture with the knight\n- e8e4: Centralizes the rook and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2e4:\n- It directly attacks the queen\n- If White moves the queen, Black can play f5d3 winning a pawn\n- If White plays Qxe4, Black can play f6d4 winning the queen\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving the rook's position\n\nOther moves like f5d3 are good but don't create immediate threats. e2e4 is the most forcing move that creates multiple threats.\n\n```\ne2e4\n```"
