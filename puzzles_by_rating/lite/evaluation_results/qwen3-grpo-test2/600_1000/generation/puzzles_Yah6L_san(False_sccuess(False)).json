When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- White's pieces are more active (bishop on d3, queen on e2)\n- Black's bishop on e7 is blocked by pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8f8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- e7f6: Attacks the e5 pawn but allows Bf4+\n- e7d6: Blocks the d-file but leaves king exposed\n- c6e5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6e5:\n- Eliminates White's dangerous passed pawn\n- Opens the c-file for Black's rook\n- After Bxe5, Black can play ...Bf6 attacking the bishop\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play ...e6 attacking the bishop\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or leave the king exposed. Capturing the pawn is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
