When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Knight, Queen, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with queen vs queen + bishop)\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on d4\n- White's knight on b5 is pinned to the king by Black's bishop on b3\n- White's queen on c6 is under attack by Black's pawn on f5\n- Black's rook on d8 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g1h1: Moves king to corner, but doesn't address any threats\n- g1f1: Moves king towards center, but still doesn't address threats\n\n4. Threats:\n- Black could play ...Qd4xg1+ winning the rook\n- Black could play ...Bb3xa2 winning a pawn\n- Black could play ...Rd8d1+ winning the rook\n\nAfter considering all options, g1f1 is slightly better because:\n- It moves the king away from the corner where it could be trapped\n- It keeps more options open for the king\n- It doesn't immediately walk into any discovered checks\n\nHowever, neither move is ideal as the position is very dangerous for White. The main problem is the pinned knight on b5 which is limiting White's options.\n\n```\ng1f1\n```"
