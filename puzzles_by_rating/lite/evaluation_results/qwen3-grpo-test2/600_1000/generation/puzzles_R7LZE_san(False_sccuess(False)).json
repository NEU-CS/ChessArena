When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, knight and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on d1\n- Black's queen is very active on a4\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White's knight on e6 is strong but can be challenged\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a4d1: Queen check, but White can block with Qd2\n- a4e4: Centralizing the queen while attacking the knight\n- f6e4: Knight takes the queen, but White can play Qxe4\n- a4b3: Threatening to capture the b2 pawn\n- c5c4: Advancing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be a4e4:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the strong knight on e6\n- If White moves the knight, Black can play Qxe6 winning material\n- If White plays Qd2 to block, Black can play Qe4d3+ winning the b2 pawn\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the strong knight or don't centralize the queen effectively. a4e4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\na4e4\n```"
