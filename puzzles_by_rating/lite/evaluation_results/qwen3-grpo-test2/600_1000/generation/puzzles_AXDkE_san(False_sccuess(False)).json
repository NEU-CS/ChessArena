When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight, bishop and pawns. Black is down a minor piece.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's king is exposed on f6\n- White's knight on d6 is very active\n- Black's rook on a5 is blocked by its own pawn on a4\n- White has a rook on e1 and bishop on c4 controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h8: Moving the rook to h8 seems passive\n- d5e7: Capturing the knight would be good, but after Nxe7 Bxe7, White's c-pawn becomes dangerous\n- a5a6: Moving the rook to a6 to free it from the pawn\n- d5f4: Centralizing the knight and attacking the bishop\n\n4. Best move seems to be a5a6:\n- Frees the rook from the blocking pawn\n- Prepares to double rooks on the a-file\n- Maintains control of the a4 pawn\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n- Keeps options open for the bishop\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to strengthen their control. a5a6 is the most active and flexible move.\n\n```\na5a6\n```"
