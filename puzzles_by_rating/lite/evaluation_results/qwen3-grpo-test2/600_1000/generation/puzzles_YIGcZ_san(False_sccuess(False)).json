When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Queen, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Queen, Rook, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with queen vs queen + rook)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on a4\n- Black's queen is on f2, attacking h4 pawn\n- White's knight on e7 is very strong\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's king is on h3\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g8h8: Moves king to corner, but seems passive\n- g8f8: Moves king towards center, but still exposed\n- g8h7: Moves king towards h4 pawn, but puts it on same file as white queen\n\n4. Threats:\n- White could play Qa4-f4+ next move, forcing black king to move\n- Black's queen is attacking h4 pawn, but white can defend it with Kh3-g4\n\nAfter considering all options, g8h7 seems most active:\n- It moves the king towards the h4 pawn\n- It prepares to defend the pawn with Qf2-g3 next move\n- It avoids potential checks from white queen\n- It keeps options open for the king to move to g6 or h6 later\n\nThe other moves are too passive and allow white to consolidate.\n\n```\ng8h7\n```"
