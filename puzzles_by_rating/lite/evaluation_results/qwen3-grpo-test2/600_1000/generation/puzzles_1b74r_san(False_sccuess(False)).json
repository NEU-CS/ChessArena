When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and bishop vs White's queen, but Black has some compensation with the active pieces and White's exposed king.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on b7 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's knight on h5 is attacking the queen\n- Black's bishop on c5 is very active\n- White's king is still in the center\n- Black's king is exposed but White doesn't have immediate threats\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5e8: Captures the queen but allows Qxe8 winning the bishop\n- h5f7: Attacks the queen while maintaining the bishop's activity\n- c5e3: Centralizes the bishop and threatens to win material\n- d8e7: Connects rooks and prepares to defend the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5f7:\n- It attacks the queen while maintaining the bishop's activity\n- If Q moves, Black can play Bxe3 winning a pawn\n- If Q takes the knight (Qxf7), then Bxe3 wins a pawn\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while not allowing any counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't attack the queen or allow White to escape with the queen. h5f7 is the most forcing move.\n\n```\nh5f7\n```"
