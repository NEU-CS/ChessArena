When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but Black's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- White's bishop on e6 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on c6\n- White has a knight on c3 that could be useful\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6g8: Bishop takes rook, but after ...Kxg8 White doesn't have enough compensation\n- e6f7: Checks the king, but Black can just take the bishop\n- c3d5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the c6 pawn\n- f2f5: Pushes the pawn to open lines against Black's king\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3d5 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the dangerous c6 pawn\n- If Black takes the knight (c6d5), White can play Bf7+ winning the rook\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with f2f5 increasing pressure\n- It maintains all of White's options while improving piece activity\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to consolidate. c3d5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
