When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight, bishop and pawns. Black is down a minor piece but has some compensation with active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on g3 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on b2\n- Black's king is relatively safe on e5\n- White has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3g2: Rook checks the king, but White can just take the rook with Kxg2\n- g3g4: Attacks the f3 square and keeps pressure\n- e5f4: Centralizes the king and attacks the knight\n- b8b7: Moves the rook to a more active file\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5f4:\n- Centralizes the king\n- Attacks the knight on b4\n- If White moves the knight, Black can play g3g2+ winning the rook\n- If White doesn't move the knight, Black can play g3g2+ next move anyway\n- Keeps all options open for the rook\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish as much or allow White to consolidate. e5f4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\ne5f4\n```"
