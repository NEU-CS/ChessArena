When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, pawns and king. Black is down a minor piece (bishop vs pawn).\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on d6 that could be dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- Black's rook on b1 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White's rook on b7 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8g8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- a8e8: Centralizes the rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n- b1b6: Attacks the d6 pawn but allows Rb7xb6\n- e7e6: Blocks the d6 pawn but weakens f6\n- f5f4: Advances a pawn but doesn't address main issues\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7e6:\n- Blocks the dangerous d6 passed pawn\n- Maintains control over f5 square\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Keeps options open for the rook\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or create new weaknesses. e7e6 is the most solid move that maintains Black's position.\n\n```\ne7e6\n```"
