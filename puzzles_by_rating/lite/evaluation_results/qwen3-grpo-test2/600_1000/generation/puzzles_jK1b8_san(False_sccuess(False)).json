When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen and pawns vs White's queen and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen is very active on a4\n- Black's queen is on b6, controlling important squares\n- White has a passed pawn on a6 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4 that's advanced\n- Both kings are exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6a5: Attacks the a6 pawn, but allows White's queen to check on a5\n- b6b5: Controls the a5 square and prevents White's queen from checking\n- e4e3: Advances the passed pawn, but may be too slow\n- g7g5: Creates luft for the king, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be b6b5:\n- Controls the a5 square, preventing Qa5+\n- Maintains pressure on the a6 pawn\n- Keeps the queen active and centralized\n- Doesn't allow any immediate checks or threats from White\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or miss opportunities to maintain control. b6b5 is the most precise move in this position.\n\n```\nb6b5\n```"
