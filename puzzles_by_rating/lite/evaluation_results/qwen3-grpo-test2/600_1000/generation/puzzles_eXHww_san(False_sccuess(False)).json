When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, pawns and king. Black has a knight, pawns and king. Material is roughly equal (rook vs knight).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's knight on d3 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on g3\n- Black's king is on g6\n- White has a passed pawn on e4\n- Black has pawns on a7, b6, c5, g5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3g4: Moves king away from potential checks but blocks e4 pawn\n- h1h4: Attacks the g5 pawn but allows ...Nf4+ fork\n- e4e5: Advances passed pawn but allows ...Nf4+ \n- f2f4: Stops ...g4 but weakens e4 pawn\n- h1h3: Keeps rook active and prevents ...Nf4+\n\n4. Best move seems to be h1h3 because:\n- Prevents ...Nf4+ fork (which would be devastating)\n- Maintains rook's activity\n- Doesn't block any pawns\n- Keeps options to attack g5 pawn later\n- The rook on h3 is very active and can swing to h5 or h4 as needed\n\nOther moves either allow dangerous forks or don't improve White's position as much.\n\n```\nh1h3\n```"
