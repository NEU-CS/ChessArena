When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's rook on e5 is very active\n- White's knight on d6 is strong but potentially trapped\n- Black's bishop on b5 is controlling important squares\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on h8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5e4: Centralizing the rook and attacking the f3 pawn\n- b5e2: Bishop check, but White can just take the bishop\n- e5e3: Attacking the rook on f1\n- b5d3: Bishop move attacking the knight on d6\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5e4:\n- Centralizes the rook\n- Prepares to double on the e-file\n- Threatens to win the f3 pawn\n- If White takes the rook (Rxe4), Black can play Bxd3 winning the knight\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with e4e3 attacking the rook\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish as much or allow White to consolidate. e5e4 maintains Black's initiative and puts pressure on White's position.\n\n```\ne5e4\n```"
