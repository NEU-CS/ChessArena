When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, knight and pawns vs White's rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on d6\n- White's king is on f2\n- Black has a passed pawn on f3 that's very dangerous\n- White has a knight on g4 controlling key squares\n- Black's rook on e7 is active but could be vulnerable\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7f8: Moves the rook to safety but doesn't address the f3 pawn\n- e7g6: Attacks the knight on g4, but allows White to defend\n- d6e6: Moves the king towards the center but exposes it more\n- b6b5: Advances the pawn but doesn't address immediate concerns\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7g6:\n- It attacks the knight on g4 which is controlling key squares\n- If White moves the knight, Black can push the f3 pawn\n- It maintains control of the f5 square\n- It's more active than moving the rook or king\n\nThe move e7g6 puts maximum pressure on White's position while maintaining Black's advantages. It's the most active and forcing move in the position.\n\n```\ne7g6\n```"
