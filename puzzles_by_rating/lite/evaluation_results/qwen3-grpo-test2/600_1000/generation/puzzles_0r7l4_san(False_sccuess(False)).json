When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, pawns and queen. Black is down a queen for a rook, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen is very active on e2\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- Black's rook on h8 is passive\n- White has a passed pawn on b3 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the rook out of the corner but doesn't address any threats\n- c5e3: Attacks the queen and defends the f4 pawn\n- f6h5: Moves the knight to a more active square\n- e6d5: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the b3 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5e3 because:\n- It attacks White's powerful queen\n- It defends the f4 pawn which is under pressure from White's bishop\n- It maintains material balance by keeping the queen under attack\n- It's difficult for White to defend the queen while maintaining other aspects of the position\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or leave Black's position too passive. The queen must be dealt with immediately.\n\n```\nc5e3\n```"
