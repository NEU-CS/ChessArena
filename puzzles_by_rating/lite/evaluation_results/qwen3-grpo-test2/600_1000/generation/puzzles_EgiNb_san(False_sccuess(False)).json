When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, pawns vs Black's rook, queen, pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on e5 is very powerful, attacking multiple squares\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n- White has a rook on d6 that's very active\n- Black's rook on c8 is not very active\n\n3. Looking at the legal moves:\n- g1g2: Moves king towards center but still leaves it exposed to checks\n- g1h1: Moves king to corner, which is generally unsafe\n- g1f1: Moves king towards the rook on d6, which seems most sensible\n\n4. Why g1f1 is best:\n- Gets the king closer to the active rook on d6\n- Avoids potential checks from the queen\n- Prepares to possibly bring the king towards the center via e2\n- Doesn't leave the king in a more exposed position\n\nThe other moves either expose the king more or don't improve its safety. g1f1 is the most logical choice to safeguard the king while maintaining coordination with the rook.\n\n```\ng1f1\n```"
