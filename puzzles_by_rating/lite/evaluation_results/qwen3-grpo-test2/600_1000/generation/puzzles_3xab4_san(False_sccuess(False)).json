When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on f2 is threatening White's rook on e1\n- White's bishop on g5 is pinned to the king by Black's rook on e8\n- White's king is exposed on d2\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- d2d1: Moves king away from potential checks but leaves rook hanging\n- d2c1: Moves king to safety but still leaves rook hanging\n- g4e2: Captures the threatening queen but allows Black to play ...Rxe2 with counterplay\n- e1e2: Moves rook to safety while maintaining the pin\n\n4. Best move is e1e2 because:\n- It saves the rook from the queen's attack\n- Maintains the pin on the bishop\n- After Qxe2, White can play Bf4 attacking the queen\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains material equality while being safer\n\nThe other moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threat.\n\n```\ne1e2\n```"
