When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, bishop and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's bishop on h4 is very active\n- White's queen on e2 is exposed\n- Black has a passed pawn on g3 that's close to promotion\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4d8: Bishop takes queen - this seems very tempting as it wins material\n- g3g4: Advances the passed pawn, but allows White to defend\n- h4e7: Centralizes the bishop while maintaining pressure\n- f8f3: Rook move that attacks the queen\n\n4. After h4d8:\n- If Qxd8, then g3g2 promotes the pawn with check\n- If Q moves, Black can play g3g2 promoting the pawn\n- White has no good way to stop both the bishop capture and pawn promotion\n\n5. Other moves don't win material immediately or allow White to consolidate. h4d8 is the most forcing and wins material while maintaining Black's active pieces.\n\nThe best move is:\n```\nh4d8\n```"
