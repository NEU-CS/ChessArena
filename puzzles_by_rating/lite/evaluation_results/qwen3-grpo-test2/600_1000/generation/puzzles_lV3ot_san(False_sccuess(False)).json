When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and bishop vs White's rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e3\n- Black's rook on a2 is very active\n- Black's bishop on c6 controls important squares\n- White has passed pawns on c4 and f5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a2a3: Attacks the c4 pawn and threatens to win material\n- a2a4: Similar idea but less direct\n- c6d5: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the f5 pawn\n- a2g2: Checks the king and forces it to move\n\n4. Best move seems to be a2a3 because:\n- It directly attacks the c4 pawn which is White's most advanced passed pawn\n- If White takes the rook (Rxa3), Black can play Bb5+ winning the f5 pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with Ra4 or Ra5, maintaining pressure\n- It keeps all Black's pieces active and coordinated\n\nOther moves like c6d5 are good but don't create immediate threats, and a2g2+ allows White to defend.\n\n```\na2a3\n```"
