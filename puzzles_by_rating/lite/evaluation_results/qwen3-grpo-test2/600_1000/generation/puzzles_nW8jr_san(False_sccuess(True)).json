When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on a6 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on c8\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's rook on h8 is not very active\n- White's rook on d2 is controlling the d-file\n\n3. The only legal move is c8b8 (king moves from c8 to b8). Let's see why:\n- Moving the king to b8 gets it away from the a6 queen's diagonal\n- It also connects the rooks (after moving, the rook on d8 can potentially move to d7)\n- There are no other legal moves - the king can't go to d8 (blocked by queen), b7 (blocked by pawn), or c7 (blocked by pawn)\n\n4. Alternatives:\n- If we don't move the king, White could play Qa6b7+ winning the pawn on c7\n- After c8b8, White might play Qa6b7+ but then we can play Kb8a8 and the pawn is safe\n\nThe move c8b8 is forced and improves the king's safety while maintaining material equality. There are no better alternatives as all other king moves are illegal.\n\n```\nc8b8\n```"
