When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n1. Material count: White has a king and 2 pawns vs Black's king and 2 pawns. Material is equal.\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is very active on e5\n- White's king is on d5\n- Black has a passed pawn on g4\n- White has pawns on d3 and g3\n- Black's king is threatening to capture the d3 pawn\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d5d6: Moves king forward but allows Black to capture d3 pawn with Kxd3\n- d5c6: Moves king away from center, not optimal\n- d5c5: Keeps king active but doesn't address the d3 pawn threat\n- d5c4: Moves king towards Black's pawns but abandons d3\n- d3d4: Protects the pawn and maintains king's activity\n4. Best move is d3d4 because:\n- It protects the d3 pawn from being captured\n- Maintains king's central activity\n- Prevents Black from capturing the pawn\n- Keeps options open for both king movement and pawn advancement\n- After d3d4, if Black takes Kxd4, White can play Kd5 maintaining the position\n```\nd3d4\n```"
