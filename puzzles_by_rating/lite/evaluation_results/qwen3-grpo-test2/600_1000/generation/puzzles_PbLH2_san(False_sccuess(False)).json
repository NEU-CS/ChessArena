When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen, pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight, queen, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on c6 that's very active\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White's queen on e2 is eyeing the f6 pawn\n- Black's bishop on c8 is blocked by pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Castling would be safe but seems passive\n- f8e7: Developing the bishop and protecting f6\n- c7e5: Centralizing the queen and attacking the knight\n- f6d5: Moving the pawn to attack the knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be c7e5 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the strong knight on c6\n- If White takes the queen (Nxe5), Black can play f6e4 winning the bishop\n- If White moves the knight, Black can play Qxc6 winning material\n- It prepares to connect rooks after castling\n\nOther moves either don't address the active knight or don't improve Black's position as much. The queen move is most active and creates immediate threats.\n\n```\nc7e5\n```"
