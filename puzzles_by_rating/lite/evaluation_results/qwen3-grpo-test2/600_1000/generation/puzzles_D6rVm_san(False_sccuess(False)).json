When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on g4\n- White's knight on f3 is under attack by Black's pawn on h3\n- White's rook on d3 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on c7\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g5: Attacks the h3 pawn but leaves the knight exposed\n- d3d7: Checks the king and attacks the rook\n- e5f6: Advances the pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f1g3: Defends the h3 pawn but blocks the g-pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d3d7:\n- It's a check that forces Black's king to move\n- After Kc7-b6 (only legal move), White can play Nf3-g5 attacking the h3 pawn\n- Black's g4 pawn is still dangerous but White can handle it\n- This maintains White's active piece play while addressing the immediate threat to the knight\n\nOther moves either don't address the knight threat or miss the chance to activate the rook. The check is most forcing and maintains initiative.\n\n```\nd3d7\n```"
