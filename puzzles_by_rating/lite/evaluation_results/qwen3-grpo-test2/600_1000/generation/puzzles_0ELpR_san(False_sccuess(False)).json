When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's queen and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on c5 is very dangerous\n- White's knight on b5 is under attack by Black's bishop on e5\n- White's rook on e4 is pinned to the queen by Black's bishop on e5\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5c7: Moves the knight to safety but allows Black to play ...Qc5-d4 with tempo\n- e4e5: Captures the bishop but allows ...Qc5xe5 winning the knight\n- f3f5: Blocks the bishop's diagonal but leaves the knight hanging\n- d1d4: Moves the queen to break the pin but allows ...Qc5xd4\n\n4. Best move seems to be b5d6:\n- Saves the knight while attacking Black's bishop on e5\n- If Black takes the knight with ...Bxd6, White can play Qf3xe5 winning the bishop\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains material equality while removing the dangerous bishop\n\nThis seems like the most forcing and best move in the position, as it solves the knight's predicament while gaining an exchange if Black takes.\n\n```\nb5d6\n```"
