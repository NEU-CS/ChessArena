Available move:\nOnly legal move is h8g8 (king moves to g8)\n\nThis move:\n- Gets the king out of the corner\n- Moves away from the dangerous g8 square\n- Prepares to connect rooks\n- Avoids any potential checks or threats\n\nThere are no other legal moves, so h8g8 is forced. It's the best and only move available.\n\n```\nh8g8\n```"

Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2.

Candidate moves:\n- e4g5: Moves the knight to a safe square while attacking f3\n- e4g3: Moves the knight to attack f1 and h1, but allows White to play Bxg3\n\n4. Evaluating e4g5:\n- Keeps the knight active\n- Threatens to jump to f3, attacking the exposed king\n- Doesn't allow any counterplay for White\n- Maintains pressure on White's position\n\n5. Evaluating e4g3:\n- Allows Bxg3, which would open lines for White's rook\n- Reduces Black's piece activity\n- Doesn't create any immediate threats\n\nThe best move is e4g5, as it maintains piece activity, keeps pressure on White's position, and doesn't allow any counterplay. The knight is very strong on g5, eyeing the f3 square and potential checks.\n\n```\ne4g5\n```"
