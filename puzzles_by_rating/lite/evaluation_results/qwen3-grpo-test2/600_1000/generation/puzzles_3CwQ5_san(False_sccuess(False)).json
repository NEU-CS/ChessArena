When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5\n- White's bishop on e3 is very active\n- Black's queen on c7 is eyeing the c3 pawn\n- White's knight on d2 is somewhat restricted\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3h6: Bishop check, but Black can block with f7\n- e3g5: Centralizes bishop but doesn't accomplish much\n- d2e4: Centralizes knight and attacks f6 pawn\n- c2h7: Bishop move threatening to win the h6 pawn\n- a1e1: Centralizes rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be c2h7:\n- Threatens to win the h6 pawn immediately\n- If Black defends with g7, we can play Bxh6 winning a pawn\n- If Black plays f7, we can play Bxf7+ winning the rook on f8\n- Even if Black finds a way to defend, we gain time and initiative\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish as much or allow Black to consolidate. c2h7 is the most forcing and disruptive move.\n\n```\nc2h7\n```"
