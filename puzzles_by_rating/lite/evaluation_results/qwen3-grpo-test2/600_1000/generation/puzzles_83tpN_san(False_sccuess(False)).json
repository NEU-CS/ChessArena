When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on e5\n- White's king is on g5, which is somewhat exposed but active\n- Black has a passed pawn on h5 that could be dangerous\n- White's rook on h8 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8h5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn, but allows Black's knight to check from f6\n- h8h7: Keeps pressure on the h-file but doesn't address the h5 pawn\n- g5h6: Moves king away from potential checks but doesn't address immediate threats\n- h3h4: Stops the h5 pawn but weakens the king's position\n\n4. Best move seems to be h8h5:\n- Eliminates Black's dangerous passed pawn\n- After Nf6+, White can play Kxf6 winning the knight\n- If Black doesn't take the rook, White can play Rh7 maintaining pressure\n- Other moves either don't address the h5 pawn or create new weaknesses\n\nThe most forcing and best move is to capture the dangerous passed pawn immediately.\n\n```\nh8h5\n```"
