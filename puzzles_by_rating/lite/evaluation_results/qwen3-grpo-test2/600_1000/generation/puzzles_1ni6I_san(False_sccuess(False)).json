When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Black is up a queen for a bishop, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on g4\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4\n- White's rook on a7 is trapped and needs to find a way out\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a7a8: Gets the rook out but allows Qg4h5+ winning the bishop\n- e3h6: Attacks the queen but Qg4xh5 wins material\n- e2a6: Blocks the queen's diagonal but allows Qg4h5+\n- d1d8: Centralizes the rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3f4:\n- Attacks the queen directly\n- If Qg4xh5, then Bf4e3 wins the queen back\n- If Qg4 moves away, we can play Rook a7a8 next move\n- Maintains material balance temporarily\n\nThis seems like the most resilient move, forcing Black to either trade queens or find another plan. Other moves either lose material immediately or don't address the queen's threats.\n\n```\ne3f4\n```"
