When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's queen on f6 is under attack by White's queen\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has a passed pawn on a6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6d8: Queen retreat, but seems passive\n- f6e7: Queen moves to defend the rook, but blocks the rook\n- f6h6: Queen moves to attack White's queen, but allows Qxh6\n- f6g5: Queen moves to attack the d4 pawn while maintaining defense of h6\n- a8e8: Rook moves to defend the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6g5 because:\n- It attacks the dangerous d4 pawn\n- Maintains defense of h6 square\n- If White takes the queen (Qxg5), Black can play Qxh5 winning the queen\n- If White moves the queen, Black can capture the d4 pawn\n- It's more active than retreating the queen\n\nHere's the move:\n\n```\nf6g5\n```"
