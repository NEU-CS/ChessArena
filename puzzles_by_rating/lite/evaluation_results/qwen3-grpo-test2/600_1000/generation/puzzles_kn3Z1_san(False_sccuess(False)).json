When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's king is on f7, Black's king on h7\n- Black rook on a5, White rook on c4\n- Black pawns on a6 and b7, White pawn on g2\n- White's rook is very active on c4, controlling the 4th rank\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7h8: Moves king to corner, but doesn't accomplish much\n- h7h6: Moves king away from potential checks\n- a5h5: Rook moves to h5, attacking g2 pawn\n- a5a4: Rook moves forward, but doesn't threaten anything\n- b7b5: Pawn advance, but opens a file for White's rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be a5h5 because:\n- It attacks the g2 pawn which is White's only passed pawn\n- If White defends with g3, Black can play Rh3 winning the pawn\n- If White doesn't defend, Black can take the pawn immediately\n- It keeps the rook active and centralized\n- It doesn't allow any counterplay from White\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish anything or allow White to maintain their active rook position.\n\n```\na5h5\n```"
