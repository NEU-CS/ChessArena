When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook, knight and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d7 is very active\n- Black's queen on c5 is under attack by the rook on e5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on a2 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5f8: Gets the queen to safety but blocks the rook\n- c5e7: Moves queen to safety while attacking the rook\n- c5d6: Moves queen to safety but allows Qxd6\n- g8h8: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5e7:\n- Gets the queen to safety away from the rook's attack\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- After Qxe7, Black can play Rxe7 keeping material balance\n- If White doesn't take, Black's queen is safe and can participate in defense\n\nOther moves either leave the queen in danger or don't address the immediate threat. c5e7 is the most active and safe solution.\n\n```\nc5e7\n```"
