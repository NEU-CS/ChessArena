When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and queen vs Black's bishop and queen. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White has a bishop on g5 controlling important squares\n- Black's bishop on c8 is blocked by pawns\n- White has castling rights while Black doesn't\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5e8: Queen check, but Black can block with f7\n- h5f7: Queen takes pawn with check, but Black can play Kd6\n- g5h6: Bishop move threatening to win the h7 pawn\n- f1a6: Bishop move attacking the weak f7 pawn\n- e1c1: Castling to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5f7:\n- It's a check that wins a pawn\n- After Kd6 (only legal move), White can play Qf5+ winning more material\n- If Black tries Kd8 instead, White can play Qxc8 winning the bishop\n- It maintains the initiative and keeps Black's king exposed\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is h5f7, which wins material while maintaining the attack.\n\n```\nh5f7\n```"
