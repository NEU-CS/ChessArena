When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, 2N, 3P, R, K\n- Black has: Q, R, B, N, 5P, K\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with extra pawn)\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on f1, attacking White's king\n- White's queen on b4 is exposed and could be captured\n- Black's knight on g4 is threatening to capture the h3 pawn\n- White's king is in a precarious position on h1\n\n3. Available move:\nOnly legal move is a1f1 (king moves to f1)\n\nThis move:\n- Gets the king out of check from the queen on f1\n- Moves the king towards the center where it's safer\n- Prevents any immediate threats from the black queen\n- After Kf1, White can think about defending the queen on b4 or counterattacking\n\nThere are no other legal moves, so a1f1 is forced. It's the only way to continue the game.\n\n```\na1f1\n```"
