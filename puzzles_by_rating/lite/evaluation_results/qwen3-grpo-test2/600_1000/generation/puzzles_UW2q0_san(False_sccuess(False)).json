When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, pawn and king. Material is roughly equal (rook+bishop \u2248 queen), but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on c7 is eyeing the g3 square\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black has a passed pawn on b4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g3: Blocks the queen's diagonal but leaves f3 weak\n- e3e8: Centralizes the rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g1h2: Moves the king to safety but seems passive\n- b2b3: Stops the b4 pawn but weakens c3\n\n4. Best move seems to be f3g3:\n- It blocks the queen's diagonal to g3\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Keeps the rook active on e3\n- Prevents any immediate checks from the queen\n- After ...Qxg3, White can play Rxe7 winning the pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the queen's activity or create new weaknesses. f3g3 is the most active and defensive move.\n\n```\nf3g3\n```"
