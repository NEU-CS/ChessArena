When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and bishop vs White's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on f4 that could be dangerous\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's rook on b7 is very active\n- Black's queen on d7 is somewhat restricted\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8h7: Moves the knight to a safer square but doesn't address any threats\n- g8e7: Centralizes the knight and defends the queen\n- c5d4: Captures the pawn and opens lines for the bishop\n- c5e3: Attacks the f4 pawn and threatens to win material\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5e3 because:\n- It attacks the advanced f4 pawn\n- If White takes the knight (Qxe3), Black can play Qd4+ winning the rook on b7\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play Bf2+ winning the rook\n- It's the most active move that creates immediate threats\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or don't create counterplay. c5e3 is the most forcing move that improves Black's position.\n\n```\nc5e3\n```"
