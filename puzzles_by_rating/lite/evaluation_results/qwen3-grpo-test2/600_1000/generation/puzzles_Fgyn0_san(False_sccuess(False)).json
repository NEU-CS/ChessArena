When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black's queen, bishop and pawns. White is down material but has some compensation with the active knight and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on e5\n- White's knight on c5 is well placed but could be trapped\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5\n- White has a passed pawn on a4\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5d7: Centralizes the knight but allows Qxd7\n- c5e6: Attacks the queen but Qxe6 is possible\n- d2d5: Challenges the queen but Qxd5 is bad\n- c1c4: Prepares to defend the a4 pawn\n- e3e4: Opens the e-file but weakens d4\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5e4:\n- Attacks the queen\n- If Qxe4, then d2d5 wins the queen\n- If Q moves away, we can play d2d5 next move\n- Maintains the knight's activity\n- Prevents Black from playing Qf4+ ideas\n\nOther moves either don't address the queen's activity or allow Black to consolidate. c5e4 is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for Black.\n\n```\nc5e4\n```"
