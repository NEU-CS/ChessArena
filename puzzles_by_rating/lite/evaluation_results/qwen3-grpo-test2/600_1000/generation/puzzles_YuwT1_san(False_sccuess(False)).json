When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and bishop vs White's queen and rook. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d3\n- Black's queen on c1 is somewhat restricted\n- Black's knight on f6 is well placed\n- White's rook on b7 is controlling the 7th rank\n- Black has a passed pawn on c6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6e4: Centralizing the knight and attacking the queen\n- e1e4: Moving the queen to a more active square\n- c6d5: Advancing the passed pawn\n- c1g5: Activating the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6e4:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the queen on d3\n- If queen moves, Black can play c6d5 advancing the passed pawn\n- If queen takes knight (Qxe4), Black can play Qc1d2+ winning the rook on b7\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position as much or allow White to maintain the initiative. f6e4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nf6e4\n```"
