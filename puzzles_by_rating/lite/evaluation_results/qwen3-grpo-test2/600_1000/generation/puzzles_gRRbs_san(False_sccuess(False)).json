When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's king and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's bishop is active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is more active\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on e7\n- White has a passed pawn on a5\n- Black has a pawn on f4 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- f5f6: Moves king forward but doesn't address any immediate threats\n- f5g5: Moves king towards black pawns but away from a5 pawn\n- f5e5: Centralizes king and prepares to support a5 pawn\n- f5g4: Attacks f4 pawn but leaves a5 pawn vulnerable\n- f5f4: Captures f4 pawn but allows b5 pawn to advance\n- f5e4: Moves king away from action\n- b4e7: Bishop takes king - this is forced as Black's king has no escape\n\n4. Best move is b4e7:\n- It's forced as Black's king has no legal moves\n- After Bxe7, White can then capture the b5 pawn with Kd5\n- This wins the dangerous passed pawn and should lead to a winning position\n\nAll other moves allow Black to maintain counterplay with the b5 pawn. The immediate bishop capture is necessary.\n\n```\nb4e7\n```"
