When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on a5\n- Black's queen on g3 is threatening\n- Black has a passed pawn on g3 that could promote\n- White's king is exposed on a2\n- Black's rook on d8 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3g7: Captures the rook but allows Qxg7\n- g3g6: Threatens to promote but allows Qxg6\n- g3d6: Centralizes the queen but doesn't accomplish much\n- h1h2: Prepares to promote the h-pawn\n- d8d4: Centralizes the rook and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be h1h2:\n- Prepares h1-h1 promotion threat\n- White can't stop both the h-pawn and g-pawn promotions\n- If White takes the h-pawn (Qxh2), then g3-g2 promotes\n- If White doesn't take, Black can push h1-h1 next move\n\nOther moves either don't make progress or allow White to maintain the material advantage. h1h2 creates immediate threats that White must deal with.\n\n```\nh1h2\n```"
