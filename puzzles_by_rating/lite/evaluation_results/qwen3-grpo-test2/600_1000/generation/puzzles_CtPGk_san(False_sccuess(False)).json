When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on e5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's rook on e8 is blocked by White's bishop on e3\n- Black's rook on c7 is active but not doing much\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Moves king to corner but doesn't solve any problems\n- e8e7: Unblocks the rook but allows Qe5-f6+ winning the rook\n- c7c8: Moves rook to back rank but doesn't address threats\n- c7e7: Challenges White's active queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be c7e7:\n- It challenges White's dominant queen\n- If Qe5xe7, then Rxe7 and Black's position improves\n- If Qe5-f6+, Black can play Kf8 and the attack fizzles out\n- It opens the e-file for Black's rook\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or lose material. c7e7 is the most active move that maintains material balance while challenging White's initiative.\n\n```\nc7e7\n```"
