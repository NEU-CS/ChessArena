When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a knight on g4 attacking f2\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's queen is on d6, eyeing the d5 pawn\n- White's bishop on b3 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c3b5: Attacks the queen but allows ...Qxb5\n- b3c4: Centralizes the bishop and defends d5\n- d2d4: Pushes the passed pawn but allows ...Qxd4\n- f1f4: Attacks the knight on g4\n\n4. Best move seems to be b3c4 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- Defends the d5 pawn\n- Prepares to double on the d-file with the rook\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- If Black takes the bishop with ...Qxb3, White can play a1b1 winning the exchange\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to maintain pressure. b3c4 is the most active and defensive move.\n\n```\nb3c4\n```"
