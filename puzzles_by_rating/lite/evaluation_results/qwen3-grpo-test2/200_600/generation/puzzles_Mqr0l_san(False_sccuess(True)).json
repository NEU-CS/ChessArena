When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on f1, attacking White's king\n- White's rook on e6 is under attack by Black's knight on c6\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4\n\n3. Available move:\nOnly legal move is d1f1 (queen moves to f1 to block the check from Black's queen).\n\n4. Consequences of d1f1:\n- Blocks the check from Black's queen\n- Attacks Black's queen\n- After Qxf1, White can play Rxc6 winning a knight\n- Even if Black doesn't take the queen, White's position improves\n\n5. Alternatives:\nThere are no other legal moves - all other pieces can't move to block the check or get out of check.\n\nThis is a forced move to prevent immediate checkmate. While losing the queen is painful, it leads to winning material afterward.\n\n```\nd1f1\n```"
