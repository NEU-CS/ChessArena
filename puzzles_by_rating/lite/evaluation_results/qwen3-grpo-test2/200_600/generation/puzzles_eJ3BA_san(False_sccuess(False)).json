When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawn vs White's queen and pawn. Black is down material but has some compensation with the bishop pair and active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d4\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- Black's bishop on e7 is blocked by pawns\n- White has a passed pawn on b3 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8e8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- c8d7: Develops the bishop and connects rooks\n- e7d6: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the queen\n- c6e4: Attacks the queen and opens lines\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7d6 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks White's active queen\n- If Q moves, Black can play c6e4 next, increasing pressure\n- It maintains flexibility for Black's pieces\n- It doesn't allow White to consolidate their position\n\nOther moves either don't address the queen's activity or are too passive. e7d6 is the most active and challenging response.\n\n```\ne7d6\n```"
