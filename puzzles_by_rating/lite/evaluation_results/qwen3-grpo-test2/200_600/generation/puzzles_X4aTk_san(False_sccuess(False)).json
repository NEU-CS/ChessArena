When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawn vs White's rook, knight and pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's knight on d5 is very active\n- Black's bishop on h4 is pinning the f2 pawn to the king\n- Black's rook on a2 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White's rook on b1 is controlling the b-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4d8: Bishop takes the active knight, but after Nxd8 Rxd8, White's rook becomes more active\n- h4e7: Bishop moves to a safer square while maintaining the pin\n- a2a4: Rook moves to attack the pawn on a5\n- h4g3: Bishop moves to maintain the pin while attacking f2\n\n4. Best move seems to be h4g3 because:\n- Maintains the pin on f2\n- Attacks the f2 pawn directly\n- If White moves the king, Black can capture f2\n- If White defends f2, Black can consider ...a4 to open lines\n- Keeps the bishop active and safe\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to consolidate. h4g3 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nh4g3\n```"
