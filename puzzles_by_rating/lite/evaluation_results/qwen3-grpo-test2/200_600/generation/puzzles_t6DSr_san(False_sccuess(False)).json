When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and pawns vs White's rook and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's rook is very active on e5\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black has potential passed pawns on a7 and b7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5e1: Rook checks the king, but White can just move the king\n- e5e4: Attacks the b4 pawn, but White can defend\n- e5e3: Attacks the a3 pawn, but White can defend\n- e5d5: Blocks the c5 pawn's advance\n- e5c5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5c5:\n- It eliminates White's dangerous passed pawn\n- After Rxc5, Black can play ...a5 to create a passed pawn\n- White's rook can't defend both the a3 pawn and the c5 pawn\n- It maintains Black's active rook position\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or don't maximize the rook's activity. Capturing the passed pawn is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\ne5c5\n```"
