When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (rook, bishop, pawns each). Black has a rook on a8 and bishop on f8, while White has rook on a1 and bishop missing (it was captured earlier).\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on e1 with no pawn cover. Black's king is relatively safe on g8. White needs to address king safety.\n\n3. Key features:\n   - Black has a passed pawn on c6\n   - White has a passed pawn on e5\n   - Black's rook on a8 is very active\n   - White's rook on a1 is blocked by pawns\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - e1g1 (castling) - gets king to safety but leaves rook on a1 vulnerable\n   - e1f2 - moves king towards center but still exposed\n   - a1a7 - challenges Black's active rook\n   - e5e6 - advances passed pawn but may be premature\n\nAfter considering these, a1a7 seems most promising because:\n1) It challenges Black's active rook on a8\n2) If Black takes (rxa7), White can play e5e6 creating a strong passed pawn\n3) It opens the a-file for White's rook\n4) It maintains flexibility for king movement\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate problems or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\na1a7\n```"
