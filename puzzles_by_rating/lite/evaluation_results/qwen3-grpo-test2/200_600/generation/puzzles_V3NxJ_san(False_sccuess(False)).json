When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's bishop, rook and pawns. White is down material (minor piece vs rook).\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a rook on d5 controlling the open file\n- White's bishop on c3 is blocked by its own pawn on d4\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on c5 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c3a5: Bishop moves to a5, attacking the a6 pawn but doesn't accomplish much\n- c3d4: Captures the pawn, but after ...Rxd4 White's position remains difficult\n- c5c6: Advances the passed pawn, but Black can play ...bxc6\n- b1b5: Rook moves to b5, attacking the a5 bishop and putting pressure on the 5th rank\n\n4. Best move seems to be b1b5:\n- Attacks the a5 bishop\n- Puts pressure on the 5th rank where Black's king is weak\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can play c5c6 advancing the passed pawn\n- If Black plays ...Bb6, White can play Bd4 winning the d5 rook\n\nThis move creates immediate threats while maintaining some counterplay with the passed pawn. It's the most active move in the position.\n\n```\nb1b5\n```"
