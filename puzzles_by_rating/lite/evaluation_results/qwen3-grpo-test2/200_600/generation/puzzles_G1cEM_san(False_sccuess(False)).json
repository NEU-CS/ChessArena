When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully as Black.\n\nKey features of the position:\n1. Material is roughly equal (Black has a bishop pair, White has a bishop and knight)\n2. Black's king is exposed on e7\n3. White has a passed pawn on b5 and active pieces (bishop on c5, queen on d5)\n4. Black's rook on d8 is very active\n5. White's king is exposed on d2\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. d8d5 - trading queens, but after Qxd5 Bxd5, White's bishop pair becomes strong\n2. f5e4 - attacking the knight, but White can play Nf3 defending\n3. f5d3 - attacking the bishop, but White can play Bf4\n4. c7c5 - challenging the bishop, but White can play Bf4\n5. e7f8 - moving the king to safety\n\nAfter considering these, e7f8 seems most prudent:\n- Gets the king to safety away from potential checks\n- Prepares to connect rooks\n- Maintains all options for the bishop on f5\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n\nOther moves either trade unfavorably or leave the king exposed. The king move is the most solid choice in this position.\n\n```\ne7f8\n```"
