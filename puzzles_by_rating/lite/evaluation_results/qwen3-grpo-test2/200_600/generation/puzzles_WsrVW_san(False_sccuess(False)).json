When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's rook on f8 is very active\n- White's rook on g5 is attacking Black's pawn on h7\n- Black's bishop on c4 is very active, controlling key squares\n- White's king is exposed on h3\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8g8: Defends the h7 pawn but seems passive\n- c4a6: Moves bishop to safety but doesn't accomplish much\n- a2a4: Advances the passed pawn but allows White to capture it\n- a2a1: Retreats the rook but seems pointless\n- c4d3: Attacks the rook on g5 while developing the bishop\n\n4. Best move seems to be c4d3 because:\n- It attacks the rook on g5\n- If White takes the bishop (Rxd3), Black can play Rf3+ winning the bishop on f3\n- If White moves the rook, Black can play Bf2 attacking the rook again\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving the bishop's position\n\nThe move c4d3 creates immediate threats and forces White to react, giving Black the initiative.\n\n```\nc4d3\n```"
