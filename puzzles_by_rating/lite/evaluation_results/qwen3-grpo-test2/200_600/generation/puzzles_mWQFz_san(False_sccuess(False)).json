When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White's pawn is on b4, Black's pawn on h5\n4. White's king needs to either:\n   - Support the b-pawn's advance\n   - Stop Black's h-pawn from promoting\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. b5c6 - moves away from both pawns, not helpful\n2. b5b6 - moves up but doesn't address h-pawn\n3. b5a6 - moves away from action\n4. b5c5 - centralizes king but still doesn't stop h-pawn\n5. b5a5 - moves away from h-pawn\n6. b5c4 - moves towards h-pawn while maintaining b-pawn support\n7. b5a4 - moves away from h-pawn\n\nThe best move is b5c4 because:\n- It heads towards the h-pawn which is more dangerous\n- It still maintains the option to support the b-pawn's advance\n- It's the most active move, putting pressure on Black to defend\n- After Kc4, White can follow up with Kd5 to stop the h-pawn while pushing the b-pawn\n\n```\nb5c4\n```"
