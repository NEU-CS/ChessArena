When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is down a knight but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black's bishop on e4 is strong, controlling important squares\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that could be dangerous\n\n3. The only legal move is h8h7 (king moves from h8 to h7). Let's see why:\n- If we don't take the queen, White can play Qh7g7+ winning the bishop on e4\n- After Kh7, White can play Qh7g7+ Bg6 Qg6f7 winning the bishop\n- Alternatively, after Kh7, White can play Qh7h8+ Kxh8 and Black is down material\n\n4. Taking the queen is forced:\n- h8h7 is the only move to avoid immediate loss of material\n- After h8h7, if Qh7g7+ Bg6, Black can play Qg6f7 winning the bishop\n- This leads to a roughly equal material situation after exchanges\n\nTherefore, the best and only move is to take the queen:\n\n```\nh8h7\n```"
