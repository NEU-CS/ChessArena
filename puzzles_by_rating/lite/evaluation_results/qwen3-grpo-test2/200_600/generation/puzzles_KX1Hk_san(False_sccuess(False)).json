When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on f5\n- Black's rook on f8 is under attack by the queen\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White has a passed pawn on f4 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Moves the king to safety but doesn't address the rook threat\n- f8g8: Moves the rook away from attack but blocks the king's escape\n- f8f7: Moves the rook to defend the king while maintaining control\n- f8f6: Moves the rook to attack the queen, but Qxf6 would be bad for Black\n- h7h6: Creates luft but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be f8f7:\n- Defends the king by blocking the queen's diagonal\n- Maintains control of the f-file\n- Keeps options to move the rook later if needed\n- Prevents any immediate tactics from White\n\nOther moves either don't address the threat or create new weaknesses. f8f7 is the most solid choice.\n\n```\nf8f7\n```"
