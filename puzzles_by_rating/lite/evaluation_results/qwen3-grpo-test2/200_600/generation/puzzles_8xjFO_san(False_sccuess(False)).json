When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's rook on f6 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on e2\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5\n- White has a passed pawn on b4\n- Black's h3 rook is threatening to capture the e3 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h3e3: Captures the pawn, but after Kxe3, Black's rook isn't doing much\n- f6f2: Checks the king, but White can just take the rook\n- f6f1: Checks the king, but White can play Kd3 escaping\n- h3h2: Threatens to promote, but White can play Kd3\n\n4. Best move seems to be h3e3:\n- It wins a pawn immediately\n- After Kxe3, Black can play f6f2+ winning the e3 pawn back with a discovered check\n- This leads to a favorable exchange: rook for bishop, leaving Black with a passed a-pawn\n\nThe sequence would be:\n1... h3e3\n2. Kxe3 f6f2+\n3. Kd3 Rxe3+\n4. Kc4 (or Kd4) and Black's a-pawn is very dangerous\n\n```\nh3e3\n```"
