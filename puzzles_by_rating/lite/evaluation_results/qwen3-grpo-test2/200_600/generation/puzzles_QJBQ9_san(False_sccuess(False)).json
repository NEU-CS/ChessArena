When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a rook on c4 attacking White's rook on b6\n- White's knight on e4 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on c7\n- White has a passed pawn on a2 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6b7: Moves the rook to safety but doesn't address the attack on it\n- e4f6: Centralizes the knight and attacks the g7 pawn\n- e3h6: Bishop move that threatens to win the h7 pawn\n- d2d8: Rook move that checks the king and could be dangerous\n\n4. Best move seems to be d2d8:\n- It's a check that forces the king to move\n- After Kc7-b7 (only legal move), White can play Rb6-b7 winning the pawn\n- Even if Black tries Kc7-c8, White can play Rb6-b8 winning the rook\n- This seems like the most forcing and winning line\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or don't create immediate winning opportunities. The check is the most decisive.\n\n```\nd2d8\n```"
