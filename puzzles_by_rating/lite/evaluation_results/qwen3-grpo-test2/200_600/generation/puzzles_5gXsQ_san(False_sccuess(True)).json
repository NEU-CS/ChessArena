When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Queen, Bishop, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Rook, Bishop, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with queen vs no queen)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White has a rook on c8 controlling the 8th rank\n- Black has a queen on d4 attacking white's queen on c2\n- Black has a passed pawn on f4\n- White has a passed pawn on a6\n\n3. Available move:\nOnly legal move is d8c8 (queen takes rook)\n\n4. Consequences of d8c8:\n- Black's queen captures the rook\n- White's queen must move (likely to c3 or c1)\n- Black can then play ...Qxc2 winning the queen\n- Even if White doesn't take the queen, Black is up material\n\n5. Alternatives:\nThere are no other legal moves - d8c8 is forced\n\nThe move d8c8 is forced and leads to a winning material advantage. After Qxc8, Black can capture the queen on c2 next move.\n\n```\nd8c8\n```"
