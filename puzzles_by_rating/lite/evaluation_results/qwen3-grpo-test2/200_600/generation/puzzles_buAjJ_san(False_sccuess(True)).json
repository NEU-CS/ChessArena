When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on d8 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White has a rook on g4 attacking f5 pawn\n- Black's bishop on b6 is blocked by its own pawn on c6\n\n3. The only legal move is b6d8, which is a bishop move capturing the queen. Let's see the consequences:\n- After b6d8, White can play Nf5 attacking the bishop\n- Black would have to move the bishop, but where?\n  - If Bc7, White can play Qd7+ winning the bishop\n  - If Be6, White can play Qd6+ winning the bishop\n  - Other moves also lose the bishop\n\n4. Alternative ideas:\n- There are no other legal moves available\n- The pawn on f5 is under attack but can't be saved\n- The king has no safe squares\n\nThe move b6d8 is forced but leads to immediate loss of the bishop after Nf5. However, it's the only move available and at least reduces material deficit by capturing the queen.\n\n```\nb6d8\n```"
