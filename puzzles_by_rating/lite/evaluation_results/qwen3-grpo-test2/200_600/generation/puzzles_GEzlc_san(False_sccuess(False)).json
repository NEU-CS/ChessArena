When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, pawns vs Black's rook, queen, pawns. Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop vs queen).\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on d5\n- White's rook on b8 is passive\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5\n- White has a passed pawn on c6\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3a7: Queen takes rook, but after ...Qxa7 White's rook is still passive\n- e3b6: Attacks the a5 pawn, but Black can defend with ...Qc5\n- c6c7: Advances the passed pawn, but Black can play ...Qd6 stopping it\n- b8b7: Activates the rook and attacks the a5 pawn\n- e3e4: Centralizes the queen and attacks the d5 queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be b8b7:\n- Activates the rook\n- Puts pressure on the a5 pawn\n- If Black takes the rook with ...Qxb7, White can play c6c7 creating a passed pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can double rooks on the b-file\n- Maintains all other options\n\nThe move b8b7 improves White's piece activity while maintaining all options. It's the most flexible and active move in the position.\n\n```\nb8b7\n```"
