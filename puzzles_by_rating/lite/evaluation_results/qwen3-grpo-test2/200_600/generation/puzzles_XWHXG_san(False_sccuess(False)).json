When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's queen, but White has a strong knight on h8 and bishop on c4. Black's king is exposed due to the pawn structure.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on e7 is overloaded, defending both f6 and h4\n- White's knight on h8 is very active and threatening\n- Black's bishop on h4 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on c4\n- White has a passed pawn on d3 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8f7: Knight check, but Black can block with queen\n- c4g8: Bishop takes rook, but Black can play Qxg8\n- f3f6: Queen takes knight, but Black can play Qxf6\n- c1h6: Developing bishop with threat to h7\n\n4. Best move seems to be h8f7:\n- It's a forcing check that disrupts Black's position\n- After Kd7 (only legal move), White can play Bg8 winning the rook\n- Even if Black finds Qxf7, White has Bg8 winning the rook\n- It maintains the initiative and exposes Black's king further\n\nThe move h8f7 creates immediate threats and takes advantage of Black's overloaded queen. It's the most forcing and advantageous move in the position.\n\n```\nh8f7\n```"
