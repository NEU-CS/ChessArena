When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Black is up a knight but White has some compensation with the bishop pair.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong bishop on d4 controlling important squares\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen on g3 is very active\n- Black's knight on f6 is under pressure from White's bishop on d4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- f6e4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the bishop\n- f6d5: Attacks the bishop but allows Bxd5\n- d8e7: Connects rooks and defends e6 square\n- g7g6: Creates luft for the king but weakens dark squares\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6e4:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the strong bishop on d4\n- If Bxe4, Black can play Qd7 winning the bishop\n- If B moves, Black gains time to improve position\n- It's more active than other options\n\nOther moves either don't address the knight's vulnerability or are too passive. f6e4 is the most challenging move for White to face.\n\n```\nf6e4\n```"
