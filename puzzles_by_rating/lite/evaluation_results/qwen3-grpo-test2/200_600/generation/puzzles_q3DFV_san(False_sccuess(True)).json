When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a rook on d8 controlling the open file\n- Black has a rook on e5 and bishop on f6\n- White has a bishop on f4 controlling important squares\n- Black has a passed pawn on b6\n\n3. The only legal move is f6d8 (Bishop takes Rook). Let's evaluate:\n- After Bxd8, White would likely play Rxd8\n- Then Black can play Rxd8, leaving both sides with rook and bishop\n- This would simplify the position and remove White's active rook\n\n4. Alternatives:\n- There are no other legal moves available (only f6d8 is listed)\n- Black cannot move the king or pawns safely\n- The bishop must take the rook\n\n5. Conclusion:\nThe move f6d8 is forced and leads to a simplified endgame where Black maintains material equality while removing White's more active rook. This is the best and only reasonable move in the position.\n\n```\nf6d8\n```"
