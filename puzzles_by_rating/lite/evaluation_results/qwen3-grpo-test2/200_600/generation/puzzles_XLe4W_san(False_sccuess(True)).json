When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's bishop on g4 is very active\n- White's queen on d3 is exposed\n- Black's king is slightly exposed on g8\n- White has a pawn on d4 that could be a target\n- Black's knight on c6 is well placed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4h3: Bishop takes pawn, but White can play Qxh3\n- g4f3: Bishop takes knight, winning a piece (Nxf3)\n- d8e7: Queen moves to defend e6 pawn\n- c6d4: Knight takes pawn, but White can play Qxd4\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4f3:\n- It wins a knight for a bishop (material gain)\n- After Nxf3, Black can play Qd7 attacking the queen\n- White's queen would have to move, allowing Black to maintain the material advantage\n- Other moves either don't win material or allow White to maintain equality\n\nThe move g4f3 is the most forcing and wins material immediately.\n\n```\ng4f3\n```"
