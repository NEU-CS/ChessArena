When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawns vs White's rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on c3\n- Black's king is on b1, somewhat exposed\n- Black's bishop on e6 is very active\n- White has a passed pawn on f4\n- Black has a passed pawn on b3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6c8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- e6d7: Similar to c8, not improving position\n- e6f5: Attacks the f4 pawn, but White can defend\n- e6d5: Centralizes bishop, but doesn't create threats\n- e6g4: Attacks g3 pawn, but White can defend\n- e6c4: Checks the king! This is interesting\n- b1c1: King moves away from potential checks\n- f7f6: Stops f4 pawn, but weakens g6\n- g6g5: Advances pawn, but doesn't create threats\n- h5h4: Advances pawn, but slow\n- b3b2: Advances passed pawn, but White can stop it\n- f7f5: Stops f4 pawn, but creates weaknesses\n\n4. Best move seems to be e6c4+:\n- It's a check that forces White's king to move\n- After Kd3 (only legal move), Black can play b3b2 advancing the passed pawn\n- Even if White tries Kd2, Black can continue with b3b2 with threats\n- This creates immediate threats while maintaining the initiative\n\nThe check is the most forcing and active move in the position.\n\n```\ne6c4\n```"
