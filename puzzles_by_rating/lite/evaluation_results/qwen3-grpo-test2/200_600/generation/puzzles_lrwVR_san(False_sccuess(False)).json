When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (rook, bishop, pawns each). Black has a rook on e5 and pawn on e5, while White has rook on a1 and e1, pawns on a2, b2, c3, f2, g2, h3.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on e5 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on c3 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g1h2: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- e1e5: Captures the active black rook, but after ...dxe5 White's king remains exposed\n- a1d1: Centralizes the rook and prepares to double on the d-file\n- c3c4: Advances the passed pawn but may be premature\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1e5:\n- It eliminates Black's active rook\n- After ...dxe5, White can play a1d1 to centralize the rook\n- The passed c-pawn becomes more dangerous\n- Black's king remains exposed while White's king can find safety\n\nOther moves either don't address the active black rook or are too passive. Capturing the rook is the most forcing move that improves White's position.\n\n```\ne1e5\n```"
