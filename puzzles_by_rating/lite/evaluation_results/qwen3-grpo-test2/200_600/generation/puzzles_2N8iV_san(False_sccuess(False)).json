When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight, queen and pawns. Black is down a queen for a rook, which is a significant material deficit.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on d4\n- Black's queen on b5 is active but potentially exposed\n- White's rook on g6 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- White has a bishop on b4 pinning the knight on c6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the rook out of potential pins but doesn't address material deficit\n- d8d4: Captures the dangerous passed pawn but allows Bxd4 winning the exchange\n- b5d3: Centralizes the queen and attacks the bishop on b4\n- b6d5: Moves the knight to defend the queen while attacking the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be b5d3:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the bishop on b4, forcing it to move\n- If B moves, Black can capture the d4 pawn next move\n- It maintains flexibility for the queen\n- It's harder for White to attack the queen on d3 than on b5\n\nOther moves either don't address the material deficit or allow White to consolidate. b5d3 is the most active move that maintains some counterplay.\n\n```\nb5d3\n```"
