When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with extra pawn)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's rook on a2 is very active\n- White's rook on f6 is controlling the 6th rank\n- Black's bishop on f1 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- White's king is exposed on h3\n- Black's king is on h8\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- h3h4: Moves the king away from potential checks but exposes it more\n- h1f1: Captures the strong bishop on f1\n\n4. Evaluating h1f1:\n- Removes Black's strong bishop\n- After Rxf1, White can play Rf6-f8+ winning the h6 pawn\n- Black's rook on a2 is not immediately dangerous\n- White's rook on f6 remains very active\n\n5. Evaluating h3h4:\n- Doesn't address the strong bishop on f1\n- Black could play Bg2+ winning the h4 pawn\n- Doesn't improve White's position\n\nThe best move is clearly h1f1, capturing the strong bishop and maintaining the initiative. After Rxf1, White can continue to press with Rf6-f8+.\n\n```\nh1f1\n```"
