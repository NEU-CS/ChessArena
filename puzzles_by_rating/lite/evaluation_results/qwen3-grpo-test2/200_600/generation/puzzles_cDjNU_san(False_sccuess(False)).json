When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and rook vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on b7\n- White's knight on e5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5 that could be dangerous\n- White has a rook on c3 that could potentially double on the c-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f7: Knight check, but Black can just take the knight with the rook\n- e5d7: Knight check, but Black can move the king to a6\n- c3c6: Rook lift to put pressure on the 6th rank\n- e2e4: Centralizing the rook and preparing to double on the e-file\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3c6:\n- Puts immediate pressure on Black's position\n- Threatens to win the a5 pawn if Black doesn't defend it\n- If Black plays ...Rd8, White can play Nf7+ winning the rook\n- If Black plays ...Bd6, White can play Nf7+ anyway\n- Maintains all of White's options while increasing pressure\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow Black to consolidate. c3c6 is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for Black.\n\n```\nc3c6\n```"
