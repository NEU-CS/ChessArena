When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White's king is on b5, black's king on a7\n3. White has a pawn on a6, black has a pawn on f5\n4. It's White's move (65th move)\n\nCandidate moves to consider:\n1. b5c6 - moves king towards black pawn but away from white pawn\n2. b5c5 - centralizes king but doesn't make progress\n3. b5a5 - moves king towards white pawn but may be too slow\n4. b5c4 - moves king away from both pawns\n5. b5b4 - moves king towards white pawn\n6. b5a4 - moves king towards white pawn and away from black king\n\nBest move is b5a4 because:\n- It brings the king closer to the white pawn (a6) which is key to promoting\n- It maintains opposition against the black king\n- It prevents black from advancing his f-pawn (as Kf5 would be met with Kc4)\n- It prepares to support the a-pawn's advance while keeping the black king at bay\n\nThe move b5a4 is the most precise, heading towards the passed pawn while maintaining control of key squares.\n\n```\nb5a4\n```"
