When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, Knight, Pawns\nBlack is up a Queen for a Rook, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's rook on b8 is very active\n- Black's queen on a4 is controlling important squares\n- Black's knight on d3 is well placed\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g8\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- f7f8: This moves the rook to f8, but doesn't accomplish much. It doesn't attack anything or improve the position.\n- a4e8: This moves the queen to e8, where it attacks the white rook on b8 and also covers the promotion square e1. This is a very active move that puts pressure on white.\n\n4. Potential threats:\nAfter a4e8, white might play Rb8e8 to capture the queen, but then Black can play Qe8d7, maintaining the attack while keeping the queen safe. Black can then continue to press with the knight and rook.\n\nThe move a4e8 is clearly better as it:\n- Attacks the active white rook\n- Covers the promotion square\n- Maintains the material advantage\n- Keeps the initiative\n\n```\na4e8\n```"
