When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Black is down a minor piece.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on c5\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White's pieces are more active (rook on d6, bishop on a6)\n- Black's rook on c7 is tied to defending the c6 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b8a8: Moves king to safety but doesn't address other issues\n- c6e8: Trades the rook but leaves Black down material\n- c6d7: Defends the d5 pawn but allows White to push c5-c6\n- c6d5: Captures the pawn but allows Bxd5 winning the exchange\n- f7f6: Creates luft but weakens e6\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6d5:\n- It eliminates White's strong passed pawn\n- After Bxd5, Black can play Rxd5 winning the exchange (rook for bishop)\n- It opens the c-file for Black's rook\n- It maintains material balance after the exchange\n\nThe move c6d5 solves the most pressing problems while maintaining material equality after the exchange. Other moves either don't address the passed pawn or lose material.\n\n```\nc6d5\n```"
