When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, knight and pawns. White is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White's bishop on c5 is very active\n- Black's rook on b7 is tied to defending the a7 pawn\n- White's rook on a1 is not very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5f8: Bishop checks the king, but Black can just take the bishop with the rook\n- c5e7: Bishop checks the king, but Black can block with the knight\n- a1a7: Rook takes the pawn, but Black can play Rb8 pinning the bishop\n- e4e5: Pushing the pawn to gain space, but doesn't address immediate concerns\n\n4. Best move seems to be a1a7:\n- Wins a pawn immediately\n- After Rb8, White can play Bf8+ winning the rook\n- Even if Black doesn't take the pawn, White gains time to activate the rook\n\nThe move a1a7 is the most forcing and wins material while maintaining the initiative. Black has no good way to recapture the pawn without losing the rook.\n\n```\na1a7\n```"
