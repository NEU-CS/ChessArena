When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on d5\n- White has a passed pawn on b4 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a pawn on b2 that can promote\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2b1q: Promoting the pawn to a queen immediately. This seems very strong as it adds another queen to the attack.\n- d5e4: Centralizing the queen and attacking the bishop on d3\n- d5f3: Attacking the g2 pawn and threatening to win material\n- g5g4: Pushing the pawn to open lines against White's king\n\n4. After b2b1q, White has no good way to stop the new queen. The most dangerous move is b2b1q because:\n- It immediately increases Black's attacking power\n- White's pieces are not coordinated to stop the new queen\n- The new queen can join the attack on White's king\n- Even if White tries to capture the new queen, Black can recapture with the rook\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is to promote the pawn to a queen immediately.\n\n```\nb2b1q\n```"
