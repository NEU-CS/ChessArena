When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black's bishop on e4 is very active\n- White's bishop on h6 is pinning the g6 pawn to the king\n- Black's rook on e8 is semi-trapped\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f5: Bishop takes pawn, but allows Bxg6 winning a pawn\n- e4d3: Bishop takes pawn, but allows Bxg6\n- e4g2: Bishop checks, but White can just take the rook\n- e8e7: Rook moves to defend bishop, but doesn't address the pin\n- g6g5: Breaks the pin but weakens the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4f3:\n- Attacks the h1 rook\n- If White takes bishop (Bxf3), then g6g5 breaks the pin and opens the g-file for the rook\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play e8e7 next move, defending the bishop\n- Maintains the strong bishop while creating threats\n\nThis move maximizes Black's activity while minimizing White's counterplay.\n\n```\ne4f3\n```"
