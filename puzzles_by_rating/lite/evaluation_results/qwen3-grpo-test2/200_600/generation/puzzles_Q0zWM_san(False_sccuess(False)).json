When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g5\n- White's rook on b5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5b8: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- b5f5: Checking the king, but Black can just take the rook\n- b5e5: Attacking the e4 pawn, but Black can defend it\n- g3g4: Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn\n- g2h3: Moving the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be g3g4:\n- Creates a passed pawn that Black must deal with\n- Opens the g-file for the rook to potentially check the king\n- If Black takes the pawn (hxg4), White can play Rb5g5+ winning the knight\n- If Black doesn't take, the passed pawn can advance\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to consolidate. g3g4 creates immediate threats and initiative.\n\n```\ng3g4\n```"
