When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Black is down a queen for a knight, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen is very active on e2\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's queen on g5 is under attack by White's bishop on b1\n- Black's knight on c6 is pinned to the king by White's rook on e1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5e7: Moves the queen to safety while attacking the pinned knight\n- g5h6: Moves the queen but doesn't address the pin\n- c6e7: Moves the knight but leaves the queen hanging\n- d8d7: Moves the rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be g5e7 because:\n- It saves the queen by moving it to safety\n- It attacks the pinned knight on c6\n- After Qe7, if White takes the queen (Bxe7), Black can play Nxe7 winning the bishop\n- It maintains material balance by trading queen for bishop+pawn\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threats. g5e7 is the most forcing and best move in the position.\n\n```\ng5e7\n```"
