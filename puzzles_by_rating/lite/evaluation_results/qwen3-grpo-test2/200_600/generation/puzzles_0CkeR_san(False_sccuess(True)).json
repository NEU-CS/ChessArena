When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Pawn, Pawn, King\n- Black has: Rook, Pawn, Pawn, Pawn, King\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has Q+R vs Black's R+3P, but White's pawns are more advanced)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on f8\n- Black's rook on f4 is attacking White's king on a1\n- Black has a passed pawn on c2 that's close to promotion\n- White's king is exposed on a1\n\n3. The only legal move is f4f8 (Rook takes Queen). Let's see what happens after this:\n- Rf4xf8 Qxf8 (forced)\n- Then Black can play c2c1=Q promoting the pawn with check\n- White would have to play Ka1-b2 (only move)\n- Then Black can play Rf8xf8, winning the rook\n\nThis leads to a winning position for Black as we'll have queen vs rook in the endgame.\n\nThere are no other legal moves, so f4f8 is forced and leads to a winning position.\n\n```\nf4f8\n```"
