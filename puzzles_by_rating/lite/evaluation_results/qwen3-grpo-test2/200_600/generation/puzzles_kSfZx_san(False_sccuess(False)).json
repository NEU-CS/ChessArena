When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's bishop on h5 is very active\n- Black has a queen on f6 and knight on d6\n- White has a knight on d2 that could be developed\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5g6: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Qxg6\n- d2e4: Centralizing the knight, attacking f6 queen\n- d1g4: Bringing queen into attack, but allows ...Qxg4\n- d4e5: Pushing passed pawn, but Black can play Nxe5\n\n4. Best move seems to be d2e4:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the queen on f6\n- If Black moves queen, we can play Bg6+ winning the exchange\n- If Black plays Qxe4, we have Bg6+ Kxg6 Qxg6+ winning material\n- If Black plays Nxe4, we have Bg6+ Kxg6 Qxg6+ winning the knight\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow Black to consolidate. d2e4 is the most forcing and disruptive move.\n\n```\nd2e4\n```"
