When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, knight, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong rook on e5 controlling the e-file\n- Black's queen on c6 is active but potentially exposed\n- White's knight on d4 is very strong\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on a2 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6e4: Centralizing the queen and attacking the knight, but White can just move the knight\n- c3e4: Capturing the knight with the pawn, but after Nxe4 Qxe4, White's rook remains strong\n- c6d5: Attacking the rook, but White can just move it\n- c8e6: Developing the bishop and protecting the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3e4:\n- It eliminates White's strong knight\n- After Nxe4 Qxe4, Black's queen becomes more active\n- White's rook on e5 is still strong but can be challenged\n- It opens the c-file for Black's rook\n- It prevents White from playing Nf5 ideas\n\nThe move c3e4 solves the most pressing problem in the position (the strong knight) while maintaining Black's active piece play.\n\n```\nc3e4\n```"
