When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's rook on d8 is very active\n- Black's bishop on f8 is controlling important squares\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White's rook on f1 is blocked by its own pawn on e4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h1g1: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- f1f6: Attacks the f6 pawn but allows ...Rd6+\n- f1f5: Centralizes the rook but doesn't address king safety\n- e4e5: Opens lines but gives Black's bishop more scope\n- h2h3: Prepares to bring the king to g2\n\n4. Best move seems to be h2h3:\n- Prepares Kg2 to get the king to safety\n- Prevents any ...Rd6+ checks\n- Maintains control of g4 square\n- Keeps options open for rook movement\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't address king safety or allow Black to activate their pieces more. h2h3 is the most flexible and safe move.\n\n```\nh2h3\n```"
