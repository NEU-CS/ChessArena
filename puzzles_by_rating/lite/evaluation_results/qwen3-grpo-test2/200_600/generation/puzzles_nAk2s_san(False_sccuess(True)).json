When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White is down material but has some compensation with the active rook on e5.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's rook on e5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on b4\n- White's knight on a3 is blocked by its own pawn on b2\n- Black's bishop on d5 is very strong\n\n3. The only legal move is h1h2 (king moves from h1 to h2). Let's see why:\n- Black has a threat of ...g4+ winning the rook on e5\n- Moving the king to h2 prevents this check while keeping the rook defended\n- Other moves would either lose material or allow immediate checks\n\n4. After h1h2, possible continuations:\n- If ...g4, then Rxg4 and White is fine\n- Black might play ...Qd7 to connect rooks, but White can defend\n- White can try to activate the knight via b4 next move\n\nThis is a forced move to prevent immediate disaster. All other moves would lose material or allow mate.\n\n```\nh1h2\n```"
