When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and knight vs White's bishop and knight, so material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong bishop on h4 pinning the f6 knight to the king\n- Black's bishop on c5 is very active\n- White's queen on d3 is centralized\n- Black's king is still in the center (castled kingside)\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g6h4: Capturing the pinning bishop, but after Qxh4 White's queen becomes very active\n- c5e3: Centralizing the bishop and attacking the queen, but White can just move the queen\n- d8e7: Connecting rooks and preparing to castle queenside\n- c6e5: Centralizing the knight and attacking the e4 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g6h4:\n- It breaks the pin immediately\n- After Qxh4, Black can play ...d5 attacking the queen\n- White's bishop on h4 was very strong, so removing it is beneficial\n- Black's knight on h4 is well placed, attacking f3 and eyeing g2\n\nOther moves either don't address the pin or don't improve Black's position as much. g6h4 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\ng6h4\n```"
