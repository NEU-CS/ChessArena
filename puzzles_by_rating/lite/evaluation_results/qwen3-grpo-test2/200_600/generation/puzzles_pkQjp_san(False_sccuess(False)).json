When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on e6 is very active\n- Black's rook on e8 is under attack by White's rook on d7\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's king is on h3, also exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8g8: Moves rook to safety but doesn't address the queen's attack\n- e8e7: Blocks the queen's attack on the rook but allows Qxe7\n- h6h5: Pushes pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- a6a5: Pushes pawn but is irrelevant\n- c5c4: Pushes pawn but doesn't help\n\n4. Best move seems to be e8e7:\n- It blocks the queen's attack on the rook\n- After Qxe7, Black can play h6h5, opening the h-file for the rook\n- This creates counterplay against White's exposed king\n- Other rook moves either lose material or don't address the threat\n\nThe move e8e7 is the most active and creates counterplay, which is essential when down material.\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
