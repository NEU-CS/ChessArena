When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has a bishop on c4 attacking f7\n- Black's queen on g5 is very active\n- White's rook on d1 is semi-open file\n- Black's bishop on e5 is strong\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c4g8: Bishop check, but Black can block with Qg5g8\n- c4f7: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Qg5f6 defending\n- e3a7: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- c3e4: Knight centralizes and attacks f6\n- d2d6: Rook moves to open file, but doesn't accomplish much\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3e4:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the strong f6 square\n- Prepares to bring the rook to d4\n- If Black takes the knight with Bxe4, White can play Bg8+ winning the queen\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Qd2-d4 with strong pressure\n\nThis move improves White's piece activity while maintaining all options. It's the most flexible and aggressive move in the position.\n\n```\nc3e4\n```"
