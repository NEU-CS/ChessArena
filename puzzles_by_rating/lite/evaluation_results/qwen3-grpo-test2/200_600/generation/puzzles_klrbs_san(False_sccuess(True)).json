When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: King, Queen, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: King, Rook, Rook, 5 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with Queen vs 2 Rooks)\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's knight on g6 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on h3 that could be dangerous\n- White's queen is on c3, controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- c3e1: Moves queen to e1, protecting the king and keeping control\n- c3c1: Moves queen to c1, which seems less active\n\n4. Threats:\n- Black could play ...h2 next move, promoting the pawn\n- Black could also bring rooks into the attack\n\nThe better move is c3e1 because:\n- It protects the king on a1\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Keeps the queen active and centralized\n- Prevents any immediate threats from Black\n- The knight on g6 is already well placed to support an attack\n\nc3c1 would be passive and allow Black to push the h-pawn.\n\n```\nc3e1\n```"
