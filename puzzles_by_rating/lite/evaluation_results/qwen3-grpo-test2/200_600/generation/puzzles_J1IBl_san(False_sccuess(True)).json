When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Bishop, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, Rook, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White might be slightly better with the bishop pair)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black has a rook on f1 controlling the first rank\n- White has a rook on c6 and another on c1\n- Black has a pawn on b5 that could be weak\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- h2g1: Moves the king to g1, getting away from potential checks but seems passive\n- c1f1: Captures the black rook on f1, winning material\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- c1f1 is clearly winning as it captures a rook for a bishop\n- After c1f1, if Black recaptures with g7f1, White can play Qh5g4+ winning the rook on g6\n- Black has no good way to prevent material loss\n- h2g1 doesn't accomplish anything and allows Black to consolidate\n\nThe best move is obviously to capture the rook on f1.\n\n```\nc1f1\n```"
