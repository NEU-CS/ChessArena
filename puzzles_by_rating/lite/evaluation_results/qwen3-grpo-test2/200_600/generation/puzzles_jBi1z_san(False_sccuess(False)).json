Key features of the position:\n- White's queen is very active on e5\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- Black has a bishop on f6 controlling important squares\n- White has a knight on c3 that could be activated\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f6: Capturing the bishop, but after ...Qxf6 White's queen would be exposed\n- e5d6: Centralizing the queen while attacking the pawn on b6\n- c3e4: Centralizing the knight and attacking the f6 bishop\n- a1e1: Centralizing the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3e4 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the f6 bishop which is Black's most active piece\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can play Qe5-f6 winning material\n- If Black captures the knight, White can play Qe5xf6 winning the bishop\n- It maintains all of White's options while improving piece coordination\n\nThe move c3e4 seems most forcing and improves White's position the most.\n\n```\nc3e4\n```"

Key features:\n- Black's queen on e4 is very active\n- White's queen on e5 is under attack by Black's pawn on f6\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has a passed h-pawn that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f6: Captures the pawn but allows Black's queen to take our queen (e4e5)\n- e5d5: Moves queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n- e5h5: Attacks the h7 pawn and threatens to check on h7\n- h4h5: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5h5 because:\n- It attacks the h7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If Black takes our queen (e4e5), we can play h5h6+ winning the bishop on f6\n- It maintains pressure while getting our queen to safety\n- It opens potential for a discovered check if Black moves their queen\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't improve our position as much. The h-pawn advance is tempting but doesn't address the immediate threat to our queen.\n\n```\ne5h5\n```"
