When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, B, B, P, P, P, P, P\n- Black has: R, B, Q, P, P, P, N\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two bishops vs bishop+knight)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on e8 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on f5 that could be dangerous\n- Black's knight on d3 is well placed but could be captured by White's bishop on c2\n\n3. Available move:\nOnly legal move is a8e8 (rook takes queen)\n\n4. Consequences of a8e8:\n- Black captures White's queen for a rook (good exchange)\n- After Qxe8, Black can play Qd4 attacking the bishop on c2\n- White's passed f-pawn becomes more dangerous but Black can handle it\n- Black's king remains exposed but White doesn't have immediate threats\n\nThis is the only move available and it's clearly the best as it wins material (queen for rook). There are no other legal moves to consider.\n\n```\na8e8\n```"
