When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Knight, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, Knight, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with queen vs bishop)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on g6 is very active\n- Black's queen on b4 is attacking white's knight on f3\n- Black's knight on d4 is centralized\n- White's rook on e8 is very active\n- Black's king on b8 is exposed\n\n3. The only legal move is h8e8 (rook takes rook). Let's see what happens after this:\n- h8e8 captures white's active rook\n- White can recapture with queen (g6e8) or knight (f3e8)\n- If g6e8, then black can play qb4e4+ winning the knight\n- If f3e8, then black can play qb4e4+ winning the knight\n- In both cases, black wins a piece\n\n4. Alternatives:\n- There are no other legal moves, so h8e8 is forced\n\nConclusion: The only legal move h8e8 is actually very strong as it wins material after the recapture. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh8e8\n```"
