When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Material is roughly equal (White has slight edge with queen vs queen + rook)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on b5 is very active\n- Black's queen on h3 is threatening but exposed\n- Black's rook on f6 is active\n- White's knight on e3 is well placed\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. The only legal move is c6d8 (Black's knight moves from c6 to d8). Let's see what happens after this:\n- The knight moves away from attacking White's queen\n- It defends the rook on f6\n- It prevents any potential discovered checks from White's queen\n- It keeps the knight active in the center\n\n4. Alternatives:\n- There are no other legal moves available (no other pieces can move)\n\nThis is a forced move as there are no other options. The knight must move to d8 to maintain the position. While it's not an exciting move, it's necessary to keep the position stable.\n\n```\nc6d8\n```"
