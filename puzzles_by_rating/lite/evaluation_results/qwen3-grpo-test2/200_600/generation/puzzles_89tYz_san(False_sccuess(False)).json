When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White is up a pawn, but the position is very simplified.\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is on d2, White's king on g6\n- Black's pawn is on b3, White's pawns on g4 and h5\n- Black's king is closer to the action\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g6h7: Moves king away from center, not helpful\n- g6g7: Similar to h7, not improving position\n- g6f7: Moves king towards black pawn, but may be too slow\n- g6h6: Keeps king active but doesn't make progress\n- g6f6: Centralizes king, good option\n- g6g5: Puts king near pawns, but may be too passive\n- g4g5: Advances pawn, creates passed pawn\n- h5h6: Advances pawn, but doesn't create immediate threat\n4. Best move seems to be g4g5:\n- Creates a passed pawn that can advance\n- Black's king is too far to stop it (needs 3 moves to reach g5)\n- After g5, White can play h5h6 next, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- Black's b-pawn is too slow to matter\nThe move g4g5 is most active and creates immediate winning chances by advancing the passed pawn.\n```\ng4g5\n```"
