When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is very active on a2\n- White's king is far away on g8\n- Black's a-pawn is passed but needs support to advance\n- White's e-pawn is blocked by Black's king\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- a2b3: Moves king towards center but away from pawn\n- a2a3: Moves king forward but doesn't help pawn\n- a2b2: Keeps king near pawn but doesn't make progress\n- a2b1: Moves king away from action\n- a2a1: Moves king to corner, bad\n- a6a5: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move is a6a5 because:\n- It advances the passed pawn which is Black's winning asset\n- White's king is too far to stop it (needs 5 moves to reach a-file)\n- After a5, Black can play a4 next move, then a3, etc.\n- White's e-pawn can't stop the a-pawn alone\n- The king can support the pawn from behind if needed\n\nThe pawn advance is the most direct path to victory. All other king moves don't make progress towards winning.\n\n```\na6a5\n```"
