When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on e1, attacking White's rook on d1\n- White's queen on b6 is unprotected\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. The only legal move is d1e1, which is a rook move capturing Black's queen. Let's see the consequences:\n- After d1e1, Black must recapture with Qxe1\n- Then White can play Qb6e3, attacking the bishop on f4\n- Black's bishop would have to move, allowing White to push the c-pawn or organize an attack\n\n4. Alternative ideas:\n- There are no other legal moves, so we must take the queen\n- Not taking the queen would lose material immediately\n\nThe best move is to capture the queen with the rook, as it's the only legal move and gives White a significant material advantage afterward.\n\n```\nd1e1\n```"
