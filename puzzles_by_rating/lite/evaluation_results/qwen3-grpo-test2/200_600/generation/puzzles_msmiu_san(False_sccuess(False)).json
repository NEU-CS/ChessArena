When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's knight is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's knight on f1 is very dangerous, threatening to jump to g3 or h2\n- White's bishop on h5 is blocked by its own pawn on g5\n- Black's king is on e7, White's king on f3\n- Black has passed pawns on c6 and e6\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- h5e8: Bishop retreat, but doesn't address the knight threat\n- h5f7: Bishop moves, but allows ...Nf1-g3+\n- h5g6: Bishop moves, but still doesn't stop ...Nf1-g3+\n- h5g4: Bishop moves, but allows ...Nf1-h2+\n- f3g2: King moves away from checks, but seems passive\n- f3f2: King moves toward center, but still leaves g1 vulnerable\n- f3e2: King moves toward center, but still leaves g1 vulnerable\n- g5g6: Pawn advance, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- a3a4: Pawn advance, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move is h5g4:\n- It prevents ...Nf1-h2+ by controlling h2\n- If Black plays ...Nf1-g3+, we can play Kf3-e2\n- It maintains bishop activity\n- It's the most flexible move, keeping options open\n\nThe move h5g4 addresses the most immediate threat while maintaining piece activity.\n\n```\nh5g4\n```"
