When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawns vs White's queen, knight and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on b5\n- Black's queen is centralized on d4\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4\n- White has a knight on e5 that's blocking Black's e-pawn\n- Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on a5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4e3: Centralizing the queen and attacking the f2 pawn\n- d4d5: Protecting the e4 pawn and maintaining central control\n- e4e3: Pushing the passed pawn but allowing Nxe3\n- b7d5: Developing the bishop and attacking the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4e3:\n- Attacks the f2 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If White takes the queen (Qxe3), Black can play Bxd5 winning the knight\n- If White moves the queen, Black can push e3 creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- Maintains control of key squares\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to consolidate. d4e3 is the most active and creates immediate threats.\n\n```\nd4e3\n```"
