When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and queen vs Black's bishop and queen. Material is roughly equal, but White has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's bishop on g4 is very active\n- White's knight on g5 is threatening\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White has castling rights while Black doesn't\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h7: Knight check, but Black can block with Qe7\n- g5f7: Knight check, but Black can take with Qxf7\n- f3f6: Queen move attacking the bishop, but Black can just move it\n- c1f4: Developing the bishop and attacking the bishop\n- e1g1: Castling to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be c1f4 because:\n- It develops a piece\n- Attacks Black's active bishop on g4\n- If Black takes the bishop (Bxf4), White can play Qxf4 with a strong attack\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can castle next move\n- It maintains all of White's options while improving the position\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to maintain pressure. Castling (e1g1) is also good, but c1f4 is more active.\n\n```\nc1f4\n```"
