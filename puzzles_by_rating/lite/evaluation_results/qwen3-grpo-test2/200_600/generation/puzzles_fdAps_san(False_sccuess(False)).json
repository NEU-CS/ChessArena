When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and knight vs White's bishop and knight - material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong centralized queen on f4\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black's bishop on f6 is under pressure from White's queen\n- Black's knight on b6 is not very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6e7: Retreating the bishop to safety, but it's passive\n- f6d4: Capturing the passed pawn, but Qxd4 would be bad for Black\n- b6d5: Centralizing the knight, but it's not clear\n- d8d7: Connecting rooks and preparing to castle queenside\n- e6e5: Challenging White's center\n\n4. Best move seems to be e6e5:\n- It challenges White's central control\n- Opens the diagonal for Black's bishop\n- If dxe5, Black can play Nc4 attacking the queen\n- If White doesn't take, Black gains space\n- It's more active than retreating the bishop\n\nOther moves either retreat pieces or don't address the central tension. e6e5 is the most dynamic choice that improves Black's position.\n\n```\ne6e5\n```"
