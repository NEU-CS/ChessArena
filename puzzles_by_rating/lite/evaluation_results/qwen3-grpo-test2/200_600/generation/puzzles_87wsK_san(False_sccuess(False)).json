When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on d5\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black has a pawn on c4 that's cramping White's position\n- White's queen on g4 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e4: Centralizing the queen and attacking the e5 pawn\n- d5f3: Attacking the g2 pawn and threatening to win material\n- d5g2: Directly attacking the g2 pawn\n- f7f5: Challenging White's advanced e5 pawn\n\n4. Evaluating the best move:\n- d5e4 looks strong as it centralizes the queen and puts pressure on e5\n- After d5e4, if White takes (Qxe4), Black can play f7f5 attacking the queen\n- d5f3 is also good but allows White to defend with Qg3\n- f7f5 is premature as White can play Qg3 defending e5\n\nThe most forcing and best move is d5e4, putting maximum pressure on White's position while maintaining all of Black's options.\n\n```\nd5e4\n```"
