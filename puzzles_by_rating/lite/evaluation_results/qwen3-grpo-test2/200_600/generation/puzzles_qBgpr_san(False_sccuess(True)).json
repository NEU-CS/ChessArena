When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count: Black is down a queen for a bishop (White has Q vs Black's B), but Black has some compensation with the passed a-pawn and active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on g6 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White has a strong bishop on d3 controlling important squares\n- Black's a-pawn is advanced and could become dangerous\n\n3. The only legal move is h7g6, which captures White's queen. Let's see the consequences:\n- After h7xg6, White can play Bxg6, but then Black can play Qd7 attacking the bishop\n- Black's a-pawn becomes even more dangerous\n- Black's pieces become more active after the exchange\n\n4. Alternative ideas:\n- There are no other legal moves, so we must take the queen\n- Not taking the queen would lose material without compensation\n\nThe move h7g6 is forced and leads to a favorable exchange of queen for bishop, while maintaining Black's passed pawn and active pieces. The material imbalance (queen for bishop) is acceptable given Black's compensation.\n\n```\nh7g6\n```"
