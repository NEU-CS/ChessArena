When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and queen vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but White's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's queen on g4 is very active\n- Black's rook on e8 is blocked by its own pawn on f7\n- White has a passed pawn on a2 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4g7: Queen check, but Black can block with Rg8\n- g4e6: Centralizing queen, attacking f7 pawn\n- d2d7: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- a7c8: Knight move, but seems passive\n- g4h5: Threatening h6 pawn, but Black can defend\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4e6:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the weak f7 pawn\n- Prepares to bring the rook into the attack via d2e2\n- If Black takes the queen (f7e6), White can play a7c8+ winning the rook\n- If Black moves the king, White can play Qe7+ winning material\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to consolidate. g4e6 maintains maximum pressure while improving the queen's position.\n\n```\ng4e6\n```"
