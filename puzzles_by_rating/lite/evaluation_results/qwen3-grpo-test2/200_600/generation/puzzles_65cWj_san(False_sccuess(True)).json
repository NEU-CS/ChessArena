When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Rook, Bishop, Queen, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with queen vs queen+bishop)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on f1, attacking White's king\n- White's queen on h5 is exposed and could be captured\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3 that could be dangerous\n- White's rook on f5 is very active but could be trapped\n\n3. Available move:\nOnly legal move is f5f1 (Rook takes Queen)\n\n4. Consequences of f5f1:\n- White wins the queen for a rook (good material gain)\n- After Qxf1, White can play Qxh5 winning another pawn\n- Black's passed c-pawn is still dangerous but White can handle it\n- White's king is still exposed but Black has no immediate threats\n\n5. Alternatives:\nThere are no alternatives - f5f1 is the only legal move\n\nThe move f5f1 is forced and leads to a clearly winning material advantage for White. After the exchange, White will be up a full queen for a rook, which is decisive.\n\n```\nf5f1\n```"
