When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight, pawns and king. Black is down a minor piece but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's bishop on e5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on b2 that's close to promotion\n- White's king is exposed on f3\n- Black's rook on c8 is semi-trapped\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f4: Attacks the rook on c3 and threatens to win material\n- e5d4: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the knight\n- b2b3: Advances the passed pawn\n- c8c4: Activates the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5f4:\n- It attacks the rook on c3\n- If White moves the rook, Black can play b2b3 promoting the pawn\n- If White defends with Nf2, Black can play b2b3 anyway, as the knight can't stop the pawn\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving the bishop\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or miss the chance to win material. e5f4 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\ne5f4\n```"
