When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's king is on f1, which is somewhat exposed\n- Black has a passed pawn on a6 that could be dangerous\n- White has a rook on c2 and queen on e2 controlling the c-file\n- Black's queen on f7 is very active\n\n3. The only legal move is g1f1 (king moves from g1 to f1). Let's see why:\n- If we don't move the king, Black could play Qf7e6+ winning the rook on c2\n- Moving the king to f1 prevents this check and keeps the rook defended\n- The king is safer on f1 as it's away from the edge\n\n4. After g1f1, possible continuations:\n- Black might play Qf7e6, but then we can play Qe2d3 attacking the queen\n- Or Black might play a6a5, but we can respond with b3b4 stopping the pawn\n\nThe move g1f1 is forced to prevent immediate material loss and keeps the position balanced. All other moves would be illegal or lead to worse positions.\n\n```\ng1f1\n```"
