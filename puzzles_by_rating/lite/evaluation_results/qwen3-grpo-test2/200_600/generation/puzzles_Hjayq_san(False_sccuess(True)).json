Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, R, P, P, P, P, P\n- Black has: R, B, N, Q, P, P, P\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with extra pawn)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on e8 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's queen on g5 is eyeing the white king\n- White has a rook on f1 controlling the f-file\n- Black's bishop on b6 is blocked by its own pawn on c5\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- d8e8: This would capture White's queen, but after Qxe8, Black's king would be very exposed and White could play Rf8+ winning material\n- g6f8: This moves the knight to defend the king, but allows White to play Qe7+ winning the knight\n\n4. Best option:\n- d8e8 is the only move that doesn't immediately lose material\n- After d8e8 Qxe8, Black can play Qg4 attacking the rook on f1\n- This leads to a complicated position where Black might have compensation\n\nThe better move is to capture the queen immediately before White can deliver a check:\n\n```\nd8e8\n```"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Bishop, Knight, Queen, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slightly more active pieces)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a rook on e8 controlling the e-file\n- Black's queen on g5 is active but could be vulnerable\n- Black's bishop on b6 is blocked by its own pawn on c5\n- White has a passed pawn on c3\n\n3. The only legal move is g6f8 (Knight moves from g6 to f8). Let's see what happens after this:\n- The knight moves to f8, attacking the rook on e8\n- White would likely play Rxe8, then Black can play Qxe8\n- After Qxe8, Black's queen becomes very active and White's king is exposed\n\n4. Alternatives:\n- There are no other legal moves available (no other pieces can move)\n- The knight must move as it's the only legal option\n\nThis is a forced move that leads to a favorable exchange of rooks for queen, giving Black a strong attacking position. The knight move also clears the g6 square for potential future activity.\n\n```\ng6f8\n```"
