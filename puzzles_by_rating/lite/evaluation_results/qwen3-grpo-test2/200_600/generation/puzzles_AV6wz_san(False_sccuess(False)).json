When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen is very active on f3\n- Black's queen on e7 is defending the rook on e8\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has a knight on g6 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3f6: Attacks the knight on g6, but Black can just move it\n- f3c6: Attacks the pawn on b7, but doesn't seem threatening\n- d2h6: Checks the king, but Black can block with g7\n- d4d5: Advances the passed pawn, but Black can capture it\n- a1e1: Centralizes the rook, but is slow\n\n4. Best move seems to be f3f6:\n- It attacks the knight on g6 which is Black's only active piece\n- If Black moves the knight, White can play d4d5 advancing the passed pawn\n- If Black plays Qe7-f7 to defend, White can play Qf6-e5 attacking the rook\n- It maintains pressure while keeping all options open\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow Black to consolidate. f3f6 is the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\nf3f6\n```"
