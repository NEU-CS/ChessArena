When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on f8 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's rook on e7 is pinned to the king by White's rook on f2\n- Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on d6\n\n3. Looking at the only legal move d8f8:\n- It moves the queen to f8, capturing White's queen\n- After Qxf8, White can play Rxf8, but then Black has Bxf2 winning a pawn\n- Alternatively, if White doesn't take, Black has eliminated the dangerous queen\n\n4. Other considerations:\n- There are no other legal moves available\n- The queen must move to avoid being captured\n- d8f8 is the only way to maintain material equality while removing White's most active piece\n\nThe best move is clearly d8f8, as it:\n- Removes White's dangerous queen\n- Maintains material equality\n- Opens the d-file for Black's rook\n- Doesn't leave any pieces hanging\n\n```\nd8f8\n```"
