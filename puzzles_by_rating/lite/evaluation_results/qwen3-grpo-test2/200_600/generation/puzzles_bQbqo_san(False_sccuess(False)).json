When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White is up material (queen vs no queen for Black).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h6 is very active\n- Black's rook on b1 is threatening to capture the bishop on f3\n- White's rook on e5 is controlling the e-file\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- h6c1: Queen takes rook. This wins material (queen vs rook) but allows Black to capture the bishop with ...b1xf3\n- e5e1: Rook takes rook. This also wins material but allows ...b1xf3\n- f3d1: Bishop moves away, saving it but allowing Black to capture the queen with ...b1xh6\n\n4. Best option is h6c1:\n- Wins the exchange (queen for rook)\n- After ...b1xf3, White can play Qc1d1 winning the bishop\n- Black's king remains exposed and White maintains material advantage\n\nThe other moves either don't win material or allow Black to capture the queen. h6c1 is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\nh6c1\n```"
