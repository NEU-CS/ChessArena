When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong bishop on g6 controlling important squares\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- White's queen on f4 is very active\n- Black's queen on d6 is under pressure from White's bishop\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the rook out of potential pins but doesn't address the queen pressure\n- c8d7: Develops the bishop but blocks the queen's defense of e7\n- d6e7: Moves the queen to safety while defending e7\n- d6f4: Trades queens but gives up the active queen for White's less active one\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6e7 because:\n- It gets the queen to safety away from the bishop's attack\n- Maintains defense of e7 square\n- Keeps options open for the bishop on c8\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics from White\n- After this, Black can consider developing the bishop next move\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or give up the queen for no compensation. d6e7 is the most solid choice.\n\n```\nd6e7\n```"
