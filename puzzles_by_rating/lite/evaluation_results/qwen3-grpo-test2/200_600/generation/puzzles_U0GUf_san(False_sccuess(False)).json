When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on b2, attacking White's rook on b1\n- White's queen on a8 is not very active\n- Black has a knight on g4 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black has a rook on c4 controlling the c-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a8b7: Gets the queen to a more active square while defending the rook\n- h2g4: Captures the dangerous knight\n- b1b2: Trades queens but leaves White's rook en prise\n- a2a3: Moves the pawn to defend the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be h2g4:\n- Removes the dangerous knight\n- After Qxg4, White can play Qb7 defending the rook\n- If Black doesn't take, White has eliminated a dangerous piece\n- Other moves either don't address the knight or leave material hanging\n\nThe move h2g4 solves the most pressing problem (the knight) while maintaining material equality.\n\n```\nh2g4\n```"
