When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's knight and bishop. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a knight on g4 attacking f2\n- White has a knight on d4 that can jump to several squares\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- White has a bishop on e3 that could be useful for attacking\n- Black has a pawn on b6 that could be weak\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4e6: Centralizes the knight and attacks the bishop on e7\n- e3h6: Attacks the g7 pawn and threatens to win material\n- c2h7: Interesting sacrifice to open up Black's king\n- d2e4: Centralizes the queen and attacks the g4 knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3h6:\n- It attacks the g7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If Black takes the bishop (gxh6), White can play Qd5+ winning the g4 knight\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Qd5+ anyway\n- It opens lines against Black's king while maintaining material equality\n\nOther moves like d4e6 are good but don't create immediate threats, and c2h7 is too speculative. e3h6 is the most forcing move that creates concrete threats.\n\n```\ne3h6\n```"
