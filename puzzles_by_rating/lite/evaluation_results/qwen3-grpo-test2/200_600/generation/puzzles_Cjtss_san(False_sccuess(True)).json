When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, N, B, R, 2 pawns\n- Black has: R, Q, B, 2 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with extra knight)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on c1\n- White's queen is on b7, controlling important squares\n- Black has a passed pawn on a3\n- White has a knight on b3 that's under attack by Black's queen\n- White's king is exposed on d1\n\n3. The only legal move is b3c1 (Nc1), which:\n- Captures Black's queen\n- Removes the dangerous attacking piece\n- After Qxc1, White can play Qb7c7+ winning the rook on c8\n- Black's a-pawn is still dangerous but White can handle it\n\n4. Alternative ideas:\n- There are no other legal moves available\n- Not moving would lose the knight to Qxb3\n\nThe move Nc1 is forced and leads to a winning position as it removes Black's most dangerous piece and allows White to win material. \n\n```\nb3c1\n```"
