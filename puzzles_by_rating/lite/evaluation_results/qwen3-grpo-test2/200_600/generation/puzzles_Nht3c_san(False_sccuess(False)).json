When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's bishop is active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on b7 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e5 is controlling important squares\n- Black's rook on d8 is semi-trapped\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b7b8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- b7f7: Attacks the f7 pawn, but Black can defend\n- e4e5: Captures the bishop, but after ...dxe5 White's rook is overloaded\n- e4d4: Centralizes the rook and attacks the d6 pawn\n- e4e3: Prepares to double on the e-file\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4d4 because:\n- It centralizes the rook\n- Attacks the d6 pawn which is only defended by the bishop\n- If Black takes the rook (Bxd4), White can play Rxd4 winning the bishop\n- If Black doesn't take, White can increase pressure on d6\n- It maintains flexibility for the rook to move to other files\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to consolidate. e4d4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\ne4d4\n```"
