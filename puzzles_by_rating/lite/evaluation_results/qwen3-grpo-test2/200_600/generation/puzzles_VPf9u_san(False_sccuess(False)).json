When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 3 pawns\nBlack is up a Queen for a Bishop, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's Rook on e8 is very active and threatening\n- Black's King is exposed on g8\n- White's Bishop on g6 is pinning the f7 pawn to the King\n- Black's Queen on f6 is under attack by the Bishop\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- a8e8: This captures White's active Rook, but after Bxe8, Black's Queen is lost due to the pin (Bxf7+ wins the Queen)\n- c5f8: This moves the Bishop to safety while maintaining the Queen's defense of f7\n\n4. Conclusion:\nc5f8 is the better move because:\n- It saves the Bishop from capture\n- Maintains the defense of f7 pawn\n- Keeps the Queen safe from the Bishop's attack\n- Doesn't allow White to win material with Bxf7+\n\nThe move a8e8 would lead to losing the Queen after Bxe8 Bxf7+ Qxf7, which is not acceptable when we have a material advantage.\n\n```\nc5f8\n```"
