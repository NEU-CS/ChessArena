When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong centralized queen on d4\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a bishop on c4 controlling important diagonals\n- Black's pawn on d5 is isolated and could be a target\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4a7: Queen takes pawn, but Black can defend with ...Qc7\n- d4f6: Attacks f6 knight, but Black can move it\n- c4d5: Captures the isolated pawn, opening lines\n- c3e4: Centralizes knight and attacks d5 pawn\n- c1e3: Develops bishop to active diagonal\n\n4. Best move seems to be c4d5:\n- Wins the isolated pawn\n- Opens the c8-h3 diagonal for White's bishop\n- After ...Qxd5, White can play Qe5+ winning the f6 knight\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White has strong pressure\n\nOther moves either don't win material or don't create immediate threats. c4d5 is the most forcing and advantageous move.\n\n```\nc4d5\n```"
