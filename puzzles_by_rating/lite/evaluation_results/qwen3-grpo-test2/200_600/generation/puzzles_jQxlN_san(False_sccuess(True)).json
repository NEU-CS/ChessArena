When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen, pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight, queen, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on f6 attacking Black's bishop on e7\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's knight on a5 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- e8f8 (king moves to safety)\n- e7f6 (bishop takes the knight)\n\n4. Evaluating e7f6:\n- Captures the dangerous knight\n- After Bxf6, Black can play ...Qd7 to defend the bishop\n- White's queen on h5 is still very active but doesn't have immediate threats\n- Black's king can then castle next move\n\n5. Evaluating e8f8:\n- Gets the king to safety but doesn't address the knight threat\n- White could play Qh5-g5+ winning the bishop on e7\n- Or White could play Nf6-g8 winning the bishop\n\nThe best move is e7f6 as it:\n- Removes a dangerous piece\n- Maintains material equality\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics from White\n- Keeps Black's position solid\n\n```\ne7f6\n```"
