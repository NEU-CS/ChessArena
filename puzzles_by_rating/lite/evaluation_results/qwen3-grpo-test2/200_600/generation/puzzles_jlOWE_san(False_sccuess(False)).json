When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's queen is very active on b5\n- Black's queen is on h5, which is somewhat exposed\n- Black has a bishop on d5 controlling important squares\n- White has a rook on b3 and bishop on e3\n- Black's king is on g8 with some exposure\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5h4: Moves the queen to a safer square while maintaining pressure\n- d5e4: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the rook on b3\n- h5g4: Attacks the bishop on e3\n- e8e4: Centralizes the rook and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5e4 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks the rook on b3\n- If White takes the bishop (Qxe4), Black can play Qxh4 winning the bishop\n- If White moves the rook, Black can play Qxh4 winning the bishop\n- It maintains control of key squares\n- It's a active move that improves Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position as much or leave the queen exposed.\n\n```\nd5e4\n```"
