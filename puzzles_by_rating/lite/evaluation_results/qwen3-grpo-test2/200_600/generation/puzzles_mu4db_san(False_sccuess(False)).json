When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on c4 that could be dangerous\n- Black's queen on b5 is very active\n- White's rook on e4 is centralized\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b5c4: Capturing the dangerous passed pawn, but after Nxc4 Black's queen is exposed\n- b5e5: Centralizing the queen and attacking the rook on e4\n- e6e5: Moving the bishop to attack the rook on e4\n- g8h7: Moving the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be b5e5 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the rook on e4\n- If White moves the rook, Black can capture the c4 pawn next move\n- It maintains pressure on White's position\n- It's more active than moving the king or bishop\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or don't improve Black's position as much. The queen move is the most active and forcing.\n\n```\nb5e5\n```"
