When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two rooks vs one)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's rook on e8 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White's king is on g2, Black's pawn on h2 is threatening to promote\n- Black's rook on g8 is tied to defending against the h2 pawn\n\n3. Available move:\nOnly legal move is g8e8 (Rook moves from g8 to e8)\n\n4. Consequences of g8e8:\n- Moves the rook to defend against the h2 pawn\n- Attacks White's rook on e8\n- After Rxe8, Kxe8 would leave Black's king very exposed\n- But White would likely play Rxe8 first, then Black can play Kc7 to hide the king\n\nThis is the only move available, and it's the most logical as it:\n- Defends against the immediate threat of h1=Q\n- Maintains material balance\n- Doesn't allow White any immediate tactical shots\n\n```\ng8e8\n```"
