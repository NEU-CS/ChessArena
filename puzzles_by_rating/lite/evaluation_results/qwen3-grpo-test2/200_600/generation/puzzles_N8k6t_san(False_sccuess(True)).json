When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on f8 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black's queen on h6 is under attack by White's pawn on g3\n- Black's rook on e8 is pinned to the king by White's queen\n\n3. Available move:\nOnly legal move is e8f8 (moving the rook from e8 to f8)\n\n4. Consequences of e8f8:\n- Unpins the king from the rook\n- Moves the rook to a more active file\n- After Qxf8+, Kxf8 would leave Black's king exposed but White's pieces would be active\n- Alternatively, after Qxf8+, Kd7 would keep the king safer\n\nThis is the only move available, and it's the best practical choice as it:\n- Removes the pin\n- Gets the rook to a more active square\n- Maintains some coordination between Black's pieces\n\n```\ne8f8\n```"
