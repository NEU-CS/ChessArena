When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, R, B, 3P\n- Black has: R, R, Q, B, 4P\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop vs pawn)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on d8 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black has a queen on f5 and bishop on h5\n- White has a passed pawn on a3\n- Black has a pawn on a4 controlling b3\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- c8d8: This captures White's queen but allows White to play Bxd8 winning the exchange (rook for bishop)\n- e7e8: This moves the rook to e8, protecting the king and maintaining the queen on f5\n\n4. Better move:\ne7e8 is clearly better because:\n- It protects the king from potential checks\n- Maintains the active queen on f5\n- Doesn't allow White to win material\n- Keeps more pieces in the game\n\nThe move c8d8 would be a mistake as it allows White to win material after Bxd8.\n\n```\ne7e8\n```"
