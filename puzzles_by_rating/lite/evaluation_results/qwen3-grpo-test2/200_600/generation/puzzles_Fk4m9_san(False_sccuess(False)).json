When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, knight, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on b6\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black has a rook on a4 eyeing the a-file\n- White's rook on e7 is very active\n- Black's knight on g7 is poorly placed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- b5c7: Knight check, but Black can just take the rook\n- e3h6: Bishop move attacking the knight, but it's not clear\n- f3g5: Knight move attacking the pawn on g6\n- e5e6: Pushing the passed pawn (not in legal moves)\n- e7e6: Rook move attacking the pawn on e6\n\n4. Best move seems to be f3g5:\n- Attacks the pawn on g6 which is defending the knight on g7\n- If Black takes the knight (hxg5), then e7e6+ wins the pawn on e6\n- If Black moves the knight, we can play e7e6+ anyway\n- Maintains pressure while keeping all options open\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow Black to consolidate. f3g5 is the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\nf3g5\n```"
