When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong bishop on h6 controlling the long diagonal\n- Black's knight on h5 is under attack by White's queen on g4\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on f5\n- Black's queen on e7 is somewhat restricted\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5f6: Moves the knight to safety while attacking the bishop on h6\n- h5f4: Centralizes the knight but leaves it vulnerable\n- e7h4: Moves the queen to attack the bishop, but allows Bxh4\n- g7g6: Pushes the pawn to kick the bishop, but weakens the dark squares\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5f6 because:\n- It saves the knight from capture\n- It attacks the strong bishop on h6\n- It maintains control of key squares\n- It doesn't create any weaknesses\n- After Bxh5, Black can play Qxh5 with a slight material advantage\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threat to the knight. h5f6 is the most active and defensive move.\n\n```\nh5f6\n```"
