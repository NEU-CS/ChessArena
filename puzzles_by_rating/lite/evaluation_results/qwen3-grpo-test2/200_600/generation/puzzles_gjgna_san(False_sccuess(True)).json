When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on c7 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e6 is controlling important squares\n- White's knight on g5 is under attack by Black's pawn on f3\n- White's king is exposed on h2\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g7\n\n3. The only legal move is h2h1 (king moves to h1). Let's see why:\n- If we don't move the king, Black can play Qc2+ winning the bishop on a2\n- Moving to h1 gets the king to relative safety behind pawns\n- Other king moves would walk into checks or lose material\n\n4. After h2h1, Black might play Qc2+ but then:\n- Kf1 would lose the bishop on a2\n- Kh3 would allow Qc3+ winning the knight on g5\n- So h2h1 is the only move that doesn't immediately lose material\n\nThe move h2h1 is forced to avoid immediate material loss, even though the position remains difficult. There are no other legal moves to consider.\n\n```\nh2h1\n```"
