When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and rook vs Black's bishop and rook. Material is roughly equal, but Black's king is more exposed.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is on b4, very exposed\n- White has a knight on f5 controlling key squares\n- Black has a rook on g2 attacking h2 pawn\n- White has a rook on c3 and d1, with potential to coordinate\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5g7: Attacks the pawn on h6, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- f5d6: Centralizes the knight and attacks the bishop\n- c3c4: Attacks the black king directly\n- d1d5: Centralizes the rook and prepares to double on the d-file\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3c4:\n- Directly attacks the black king\n- If Black moves king, we can play Nd6+ winning the bishop\n- If Black plays Bxc4, then Rxc4 and we have a rook vs rook ending which is winning due to Black's exposed king\n- If Black does nothing, we can follow up with Rb4+ winning material\n\nOther moves either don't address the king or don't create immediate threats. c3c4 is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for Black.\n\n```\nc3c4\n```"
