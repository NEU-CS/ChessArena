When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Knight, Queen, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White might be slightly ahead)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on e5\n- White's queen is on g4, attacking the f5 bishop\n- Black has a rook on f8 and another on f1 (White's rook is on a1)\n- White's king is on g2, Black's king on g8\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n\n3. The only legal move is f2f1 (King moves from f2 to f1). Let's see why:\n- If we don't move the king, Black can play ...Qxg4 winning the queen\n- Moving the king to f1 protects the g2 square and keeps the queen safe\n- After Kf1, if Black takes the queen Qxg4, White can play Qxg4 and the material remains balanced\n\n4. Alternative ideas:\n- There are no other legal moves available (all other pieces are pinned or can't move)\n- The king must move to avoid losing the queen\n\nConclusion: The only move to prevent immediate material loss is to move the king to f1. This maintains the balance and allows White to continue fighting.\n\n```\nf2f1\n```"
