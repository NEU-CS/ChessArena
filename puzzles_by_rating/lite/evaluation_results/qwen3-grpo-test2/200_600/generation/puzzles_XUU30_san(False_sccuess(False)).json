When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, knight and pawns vs White's bishop, queen and pawns. Black is up material (queen vs bishop).\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on e5 is very active\n- Black's knight on d5 is centralized but could be kicked by b4\n- Black's queen on d7 is somewhat restricted by pawns\n- White's queen on g3 is eyeing the g7 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5e7: Centralizes the knight and attacks the bishop, but allows b4 kicking the knight\n- d7e6: Centralizes the queen and defends the e5 bishop\n- d7f5: Attacks the h3 pawn and keeps options open\n- g7g6: Creates luft but weakens the dark squares\n\n4. Best move seems to be d7e6 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Defends the e5 bishop\n- Prepares to double on the e-file\n- Maintains flexibility for the knight\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n\nOther moves either allow White to kick the knight or don't improve Black's position as much. The queen centralization is particularly important in this position.\n\n```\nd7e6\n```"
