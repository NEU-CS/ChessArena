When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, bishop, rook and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on f4\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5\n- White has a passed pawn on a5\n- Black's rook on e8 is somewhat passive\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4g3: Attacks the bishop and threatens to win material\n- f4e3: Centralizes the queen and attacks the rook\n- f4d2: Attacks the queen and creates threats\n- e8e4: Centralizes the rook and prepares to double on the e-file\n\n4. Best move seems to be f4g3:\n- It attacks the bishop on g3\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play Qxg3 winning a piece\n- If White plays Qxg3, then Rxe5 wins the exchange\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White to consolidate. f4g3 is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for White.\n\n```\nf4g3\n```"
