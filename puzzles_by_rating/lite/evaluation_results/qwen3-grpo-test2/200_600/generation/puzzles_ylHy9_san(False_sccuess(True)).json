When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Queen, Bishop, 2 pawns\n- Black has: Queen, Rook, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop vs pawns)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on d2, attacking White's queen on a1\n- White's bishop on f3 is blocked by its own pawn on g2\n- Black's rook on e1 is very active\n- White's pawn on b7 is passed but blocked by black's pawn on f6\n\n3. Available move:\nOnly legal move is a1e1 (queen takes rook)\n\n4. Consequences of a1e1:\n- Wins the exchange (queen for rook)\n- After Qxe1, Black can play Qd1+ but White can block with Bd1\n- White would be up a rook for a pawn, which is a winning material advantage\n- Black's queen would be very active but White can coordinate pieces to defend\n\n5. Alternatives:\nNo other legal moves available - must take the rook\n\nThe best and only move is to capture the rook:\n\n```\na1e1\n```"
