When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's knight on e2 is very active\n- Black's queen on f7 is controlling important squares\n- White's queen on b2 is somewhat restricted by its own pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2f4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the f6 pawn\n- b2e5: Centralizes the queen and attacks the e5 pawn\n- b2d4: Centralizes the queen and attacks the d5 pawn\n- g1f2: Moves the king to a safer square\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2f4 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the f6 pawn which is only defended by the queen\n- If Black takes the knight (Qxf4), White can play Qe5+ winning the e5 pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Qe5+ next move\n- It maintains pressure on Black's position\n\nOther moves like b2e5 or b2d4 don't create immediate threats, and king moves are too passive.\n\n```\ne2f4\n```"
