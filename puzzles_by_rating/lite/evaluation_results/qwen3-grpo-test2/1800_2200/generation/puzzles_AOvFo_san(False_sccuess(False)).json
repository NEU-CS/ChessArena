When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Rook, Queen, Pawn, Pawn, Pawn\n- Black has: Rook, Rook, Queen, Pawn, Pawn, Pawn\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with two rooks vs Black's one)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e2\n- Black's queen on a2 is very active\n- Black's rook on d4 is centralized\n- White has a passed pawn on a3\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g8h7: Moves king to safety but doesn't accomplish much\n- b8c8: Moves rook but blocks the queen's diagonal\n- d4d8: Moves rook to d8, attacking White's rook on c8\n\n4. Evaluation:\n- d4d8 is the most active move, attacking White's rook\n- After d4d8, if White takes (Rc8d8), Black can play Qa2e6+ winning the pawn on g5\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play Qa2e6+ next move anyway\n- The other moves are too passive and don't create threats\n\nThe best move is d4d8, creating immediate threats and activating Black's pieces.\n\n```\nd4d8\n```"
