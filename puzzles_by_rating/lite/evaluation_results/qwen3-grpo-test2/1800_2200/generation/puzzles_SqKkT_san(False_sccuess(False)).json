When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen and pawns vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on b7 is very active\n- Black's queen on f7 is somewhat exposed\n- Black's rook on d8 is under attack by White's rook on e7\n- Black's king on g8 is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8d7: Moves the rook to safety while maintaining control of the 7th rank\n- f7e7: Captures the attacking rook, but allows Qxe7 winning the queen\n- f7f8: Moves the queen to safety but blocks the rook\n- b6d5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be d8d7 because:\n- It gets the rook out of attack\n- Maintains control of the 7th rank\n- Doesn't allow any immediate counterplay\n- After Qxd7, Black can play Qf7d5 attacking the queen\n- Other moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threat\n\nThe move d8d7 solves the most pressing problem while maintaining material equality and keeping pieces active.\n\n```\nd8d7\n```"
