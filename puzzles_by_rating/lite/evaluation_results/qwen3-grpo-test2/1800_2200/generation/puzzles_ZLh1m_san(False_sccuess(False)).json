When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h7 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- Black has a bishop on d4 controlling important squares\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n- Black's queen on c6 is defending the a6 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7h8: Queen trade, but gives up pressure\n- h7g7: Keeps queen active while attacking f6 pawn\n- h1h6: Rook lift to attack along the 6th rank\n- f3e4: Centralizes bishop and attacks d4 bishop\n- g4g5: Pushes pawn to create threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be f3e4:\n- Attacks the strong d4 bishop\n- If Black takes (d4e4), White can play h7h8 winning the exchange\n- If Black moves bishop, White can play h7h8 winning material\n- Maintains all other threats while improving piece coordination\n\nOther moves either don't address the strong bishop or miss the opportunity to win material.\n\n```\nf3e4\n```"
