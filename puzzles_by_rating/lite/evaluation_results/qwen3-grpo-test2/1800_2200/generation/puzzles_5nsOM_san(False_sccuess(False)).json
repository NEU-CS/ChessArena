When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight, bishop and pawns. Black is up a queen for a knight, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's knight on e5 is very active\n- Black's queen on g6 is well placed, eyeing the white king\n- Black has a knight on f4 that's very active\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on d8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g6h5: Attacks the e5 knight and threatens to win material\n- f4e6: Centralizes the knight and attacks the e5 knight\n- d8d7: Moves the king to a safer square\n- g6g4: Attacks the e5 knight from another angle\n\n4. Best move seems to be g6h5:\n- It directly attacks the e5 knight\n- If White moves the knight, Black can play Qxh4 winning a pawn\n- If White doesn't move the knight, Black can play Qxh4 next move\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves like f4e6 are good but don't immediately win material. The queen move is more forcing and takes advantage of White's exposed king position.\n\n```\ng6h5\n```"
