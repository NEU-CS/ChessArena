When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen, two bishops, knight and pawns. Black is down a minor piece (bishop vs knight).\n\n2. Key features:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on e5\n- Black's king is exposed with no castling rights\n- White's queen on a4 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e7 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the rook out of potential pins but doesn't address other issues\n- e8f8: Moves the king to safety but leaves the rook hanging\n- d8a5: Trades the queen for White's active queen, but after Qxa5, Black's position remains difficult\n- e7f6: Develops the bishop and attacks the e5 pawn\n- c6e5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6e5:\n- Eliminates White's strong passed pawn\n- Opens the c-file for Black's rook\n- After Bxe5, Black can play Qd7 to connect rooks and defend\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play Bf6 next move to develop\n\nThis move addresses the most pressing issue in the position (the passed pawn) while maintaining material balance. Other moves either don't address the passed pawn or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
