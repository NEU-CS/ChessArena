When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a bishop pair but their dark-squared bishop is blocked by pawns\n- White's queen is very active on d4\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White has a knight on c3 that could be useful for attacking\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4a7: Queen takes pawn, but Black can just take back\n- d4d6: Centralizing queen, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- g3e5: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can defend\n- c3d5: Knight jump to central square, attacking e7 pawn\n- e1e3: Centralizing rook, but slow\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3d5:\n- Attacks the e7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If Black takes the knight (exd5), White can play Qd6+ winning the e5 pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Qd6+ anyway\n- Creates immediate threats against Black's king\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow Black to consolidate. c3d5 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
