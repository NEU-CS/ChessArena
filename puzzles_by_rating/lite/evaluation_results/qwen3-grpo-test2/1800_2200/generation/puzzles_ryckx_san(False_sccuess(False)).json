When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's rook. Material is roughly equal (9 vs 9 points), but Black's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's rook is very active on f6\n- White's knight is well placed on c6, controlling key squares\n- Black's king is exposed on h6\n- White has a passed pawn on b5 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6d8: Centralizes the knight but doesn't accomplish much\n- c6e7: Attacks the rook but allows ...Rf6e6\n- g2d5: Bishop moves to a more active diagonal\n- d3d4: Advances the passed pawn\n- a3a4: Pushes the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d3d4:\n- Advances the passed pawn which is a major asset\n- If Black takes (exd4), White can play Nxe7 winning the rook\n- If Black doesn't take, the pawn becomes more dangerous\n- Maintains all other options while improving the position\n\nThe move d3d4 puts maximum pressure on Black while maintaining all of White's advantages. It's the most forcing and dangerous move in the position.\n\n```\nd3d4\n```"
