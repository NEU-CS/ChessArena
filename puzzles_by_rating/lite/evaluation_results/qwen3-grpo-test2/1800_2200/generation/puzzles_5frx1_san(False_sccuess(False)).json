When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a king and knight vs Black's king and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black has connected passed pawns on the f and g files.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's pawns are advanced and threatening to promote\n- White's king is well placed to stop the pawns\n- White's knight needs to find a good square to both attack pawns and prevent promotion\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f6: Attacks the g5 pawn but leaves f6 pawn unprotected\n- e4d6: Centralizes the knight but doesn't address pawns\n- e4c5: Puts knight on a good diagonal to attack pawns\n- d4d5: Advances king but doesn't help with pawns\n- d4c5: Moves king towards pawns but blocks knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4c5 because:\n- Places the knight on a strong diagonal attacking both f6 and g5 pawns\n- Prepares to jump to d7 or b7 to stop pawns\n- Maintains flexibility for the king\n- If Black pushes f4, Nc5-d7 would stop the pawn\n- If Black pushes g4, Nc5-b7 would stop the pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the pawns or leave the knight less active. The knight on c5 is most versatile.\n\n```\ne4c5\n```"
