When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on c6\n- White's knight on a4 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on c5 that could be advanced\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a4b6: Attacks the black knight, but allows e4e3 advancing the passed pawn\n- a4c3: Centralizes the knight and attacks the e4 pawn\n- c4d4: Moves the king towards the center but doesn't address the e4 pawn\n- f3e4: Captures the dangerous passed pawn but allows black to play ...e3\n\n4. Best move seems to be a4c3 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- It attacks the dangerous e4 pawn\n- If black takes the knight (nxc3), white can play bxc3 and the c5 pawn becomes very strong\n- If black doesn't take, white can play Nxe4 winning the pawn\n- It maintains control of key squares\n\nThe move a4c3 addresses the most pressing concern (the passed e4 pawn) while improving the knight's position.\n\n```\na4c3\n```"
