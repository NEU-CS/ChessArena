When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on f5\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black has a bishop on g4 pinning the f3 knight to the king\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's rook on e8 is semi-trapped\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5e4: Centralizing the queen and attacking the bishop on e2\n- g4h3: Moving the bishop to h3, maintaining the pin\n- f6e4: Centralizing the knight and attacking the bishop\n- e8e4: Moving the rook to a more active file\n\n4. Best move seems to be f5e4:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the bishop on e2\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play g4h3 maintaining the pin\n- If White plays Qd1-e2, Black can play Qe4-d3 winning the exchange\n- It also prevents White from playing Bf1-e2 to break the pin\n\nOther moves like g4h3 are good but don't press the advantage as much. f5e4 is more active and creates immediate threats.\n\n```\nf5e4\n```"
