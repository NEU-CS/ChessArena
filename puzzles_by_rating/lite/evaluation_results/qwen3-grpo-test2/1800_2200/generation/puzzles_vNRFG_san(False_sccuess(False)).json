When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a king and pawns (K+4P vs K+4P). Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is more active (d6 vs White's d3)\n- Black has connected passed pawns on c5 and b5\n- White has a passed pawn on a3\n- Black's g5 pawn is weak and could be targeted\n- White's h4 pawn is advanced but blockaded by Black's g5 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e7: Centralizes king but moves away from pawns\n- d6d7: Similar to e7, not improving much\n- d6c7: Moves towards queenside pawns\n- d6e6: Keeps king central\n- d6c6: Best - keeps king near both pawns\n- d6e5: Moves towards kingside\n- d6d5: Blocks White's pawn but exposes king\n- c5c4: Advances passed pawn but may be premature\n- b5b4: Advances another passed pawn\n\n4. Best move is d6c6 because:\n- Keeps king near both passed pawns (c5 and b5)\n- Prepares to support their advance\n- Maintains flexibility to go to b5 or d5 next\n- Doesn't allow White any counterplay\n- The connected passed pawns are Black's strongest asset\n\n```\nd6c6\n```"
