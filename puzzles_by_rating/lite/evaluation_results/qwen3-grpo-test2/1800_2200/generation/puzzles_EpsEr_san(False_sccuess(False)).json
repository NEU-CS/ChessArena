When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal (knight + rook \u2248 bishop + queen in some systems), but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on f4 is very dangerous, attacking h2 and eyeing the king\n- White's knight on c7 is well placed but could be captured by ...Qxc7\n- White's rook on e7 is active but could be trapped\n- Black's bishop on e4 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- h1g1: Moves the king to safety but doesn't address the queen's threats\n- e7e4: Captures the bishop, but after ...Qxc7 White's position collapses\n- d1f3: Blocks the queen's diagonal and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move is d1f3 because:\n- It blocks the dangerous queen's diagonal\n- It attacks the queen, forcing it to move\n- After Qxf3, White can play Rxe4 winning the bishop\n- Even if Black doesn't take, the queen must move and White's position becomes safer\n\nThe other moves either don't address the immediate threats or lead to material loss.\n\n```\nd1f3\n```"
