When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and knight vs White's bishop and knight, so material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong bishop on f6 controlling important squares\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White has a knight on e5 that's very active\n- Black's pawn structure is slightly compromised with isolated pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the rook out of potential attacks but doesn't address king safety\n- f8g7: Blocks the bishop's diagonal but leaves the king exposed\n- d8e7: Centralizes the queen and connects rooks\n- c6d4: Challenges White's strong knight on e5\n- g6f5: Trades the bishop for White's active knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6d4:\n- Challenges White's strong knight on e5\n- If Nxd4, Black can play Bxd4 winning the exchange (rook for bishop)\n- If White retreats the knight, Black gains time\n- Maintains control over key central squares\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses in Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the active pieces or leave the king exposed. c6d4 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nc6d4\n```"
