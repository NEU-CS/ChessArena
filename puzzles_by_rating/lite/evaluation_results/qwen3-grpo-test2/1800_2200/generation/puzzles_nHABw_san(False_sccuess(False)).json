When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's knight on e5 is very active\n- Black's queen on e7 is eyeing the e5 knight\n- White's bishop on d3 is blocked by its own pawn on c4\n- Black's rook on d8 is very active\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f7: Captures the pawn but allows Black to play Qe7f7, defending\n- e5d7: Attacks the queen but Black can just move it\n- d3h7: Bishop move that threatens to win the h6 pawn\n- b3b4: Pushes the pawn to gain space\n- e1e4: Centralizes the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be d3h7:\n- It threatens to win the h6 pawn (Bxh6)\n- Black can't take the bishop because of Qxh6\n- If Black plays Qe7g5 to defend, White can play Nf7 winning a pawn\n- It opens the diagonal for the bishop and puts pressure on Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish much or allow Black to consolidate. d3h7 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nd3h7\n```"
