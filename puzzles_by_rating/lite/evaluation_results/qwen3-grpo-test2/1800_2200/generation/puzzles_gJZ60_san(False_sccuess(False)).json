When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and pawn for a bishop (roughly equal), but Black has a passed pawn on d3 that could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's knight on g4 is very active\n- White's knight on d4 is centralized but could be kicked with h3\n- Black's queen on d6 is eyeing the d-file\n- White's king is somewhat exposed after castling\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4e6: Centralizes the knight but allows ...Nf2+ fork\n- f3g5: Attacks the active knight but allows ...Qxg5\n- d1a4: Targets the d3 pawn but seems too slow\n- h2h3: Kicks the knight but allows ...Nf2+ anyway\n- d4b5: Attacks the c7 pawn but seems passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be f3g5:\n- It removes Black's most active piece\n- If ...Qxg5, then Qd2 wins the d3 pawn\n- If ...Nf2+, then Qxf2 and White is fine\n- It opens the f-file for White's rook\n\nOther moves either don't address the active knight or allow Black to maintain pressure. f3g5 is the most forcing move that improves White's position.\n\n```\nf3g5\n```"
