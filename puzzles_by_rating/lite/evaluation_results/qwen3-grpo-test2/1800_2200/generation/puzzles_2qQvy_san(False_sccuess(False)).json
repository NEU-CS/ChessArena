When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's knight on e4 is very active\n- White's queen on d4 is centralized but potentially exposed\n- Black's king is slightly exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f2: Forking queen and rook, but White can play Qxf2\n- e4g3: Attacking the bishop, but White can defend\n- e5d3: Centralizing the knight and attacking the queen\n- d8h4: Pinning the g3 bishop to the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5d3:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the queen on d4\n- If White moves the queen, Black can play Qxd3 winning a pawn\n- If White plays Qe3, Black can play Qxg3 winning the bishop\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving piece coordination\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow White to consolidate. e5d3 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\ne5d3\n```"
