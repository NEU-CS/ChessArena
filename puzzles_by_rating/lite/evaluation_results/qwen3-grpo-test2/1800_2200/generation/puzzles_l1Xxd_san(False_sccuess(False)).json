When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and pawn vs White's rook, pawn and king. Black is down a pawn but has some compensation with the active rook.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's rook on h2 is very active\n- Black's king is centralized on e3\n- White has a passed pawn on g7 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h2h7: Attacks the g7 pawn directly, but White can defend with Rg6\n- e3f4: Centralizes the king more, but doesn't address the g7 pawn\n- h2h4: Prepares to swing the rook to the queenside\n- g3g2: Advances the pawn, but it's not clear what this achieves\n\n4. Best move seems to be h2h7:\n- Immediately attacks the dangerous g7 pawn\n- If White plays Rg6, Black can play Rh6 keeping the attack\n- If White doesn't defend, Black can capture the pawn with Rg7\n- Maintains all other options while addressing the most pressing threat\n\nThe move h2h7 is most forcing and addresses the main danger in the position.\n\n```\nh2h7\n```"
