When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's bishop on h6 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black has a knight on h5 eyeing White's king\n- White's queen on g3 is exposed but active\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White has a passed pawn on e4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6g7: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- c4f7: Bishop sacrifice idea, but Black can defend\n- g3g7: Queen moves to attack the rook, but Black can play Qd7\n- d1d7: Queen centralization, but allows Black to play Nf4\n- c3d5: Knight jump, centralizing and attacking e7\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3d5 because:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the e7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- Prepares to bring the queen to d3 or e2\n- If Black takes the knight (Nxd5), White can play Bxg7 winning the exchange\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Qd3 with strong pressure\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to consolidate. c3d5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
