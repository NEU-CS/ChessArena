When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on h5\n- White has a passed pawn on a3 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a rook on d7 controlling the open file\n- White's rook on e6 is very active\n- Black's pawn on c2 is threatening to promote\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7d8: Rook moves to back rank, but doesn't accomplish much\n- d7g7: Rook moves to defend king, but allows White to push a-pawn\n- c2c3: Pushing the passed pawn, but White can capture it\n- c2g2: Moving the pawn to attack White's bishop\n- h5h4: Moving the king away from potential checks\n\n4. Best move seems to be c2g2:\n- Attacks White's bishop on c3\n- If White takes the pawn (Bxg2), Black can play Rd3+ winning the bishop\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can push the pawn to promotion\n- It's the most active move, creating threats\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow White to advance their passed pawn. c2g2 is the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\nc2g2\n```"
