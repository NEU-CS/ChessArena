When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- Black's knight on e5 is under attack by White's bishop on c4\n- Black's bishop on d7 is blocked by pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5f7: Moves the knight to safety while attacking the queen\n- e5g6: Moves the knight but doesn't address the queen\n- e5c6: Moves the knight but allows Qh5xg6\n- d7e6: Develops the bishop but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5f7 because:\n- It saves the knight from capture\n- It attacks White's queen\n- After Qh5xf7, Black can play Bf8 blocking the queen's retreat\n- It maintains material equality while improving piece placement\n\nOther moves either lose material or don't address the immediate threat to the knight. e5f7 is the most active and defensive move.\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
