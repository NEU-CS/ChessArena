When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on d4 is very active\n- White's queen on h4 is attacking the g5 bishop\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinned to the king by White's queen\n- White's rook on g5 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g1h1: Moves the king to safety but doesn't address any threats\n- g1f1: Similar to h1, just moves the king\n- h4f2: Captures the bishop while maintaining the pin\n\n4. Analysis of h4f2:\n- Captures the bishop which is pinned\n- After Qxg4, Black can't take the queen because of Rg5+\n- Black's queen would have to move, allowing White to maintain the initiative\n- This wins material (bishop for nothing)\n\nThe other king moves don't accomplish anything meaningful. h4f2 is the most forcing move that wins material while maintaining White's active piece play.\n\n```\nh4f2\n```"
