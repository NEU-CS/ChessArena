When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on h3\n- White's bishop controls important squares\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5\n- White has a passed pawn on b3\n- Black's bishop on c3 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7d8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- c7e5: Centralizes bishop and attacks a5 pawn\n- f3f4: Pushes pawn but doesn't accomplish much\n- b3b4: Advances passed pawn but allows ...a4 trapping it\n\n4. Best move seems to be c7e5 because:\n- Centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks the a5 pawn which is Black's main passed pawn\n- If Black takes the bishop (Bxe5), White can play b3b4 creating a passed pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can maintain pressure\n- Keeps options open for king movement\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to consolidate. c7e5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nc7e5\n```"
