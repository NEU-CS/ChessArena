When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop and pawns. Black is up a knight, which is a significant advantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- White has a bishop on f4 controlling important squares\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n- White's pawn structure is weak with isolated pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Castles kingside, but White's bishop controls g8\n- e8g8: Moves king to safety but leaves rook hanging\n- d7f6: Attacks the bishop while developing the knight\n- d5d4: Advances the passed pawn\n- a8d8: Centralizes the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be d7f6:\n- Attacks the bishop on f4\n- If bishop moves, Black can play d5d4 advancing the passed pawn\n- If bishop takes knight (Bxf6), Black can play d5d4 with a strong passed pawn\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't allow any counterplay from White\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to maintain pressure. d7f6 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nd7f6\n```"
