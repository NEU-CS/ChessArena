When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (no pieces captured yet). Black has a bishop pair, but White has better pawn structure.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a knight on d2 threatening to fork king and rook\n- White's king is still in the center\n- Black's bishop on f5 is very active\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's pawn on b6 is weak\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2b5: Attacks the weak b6 pawn, but allows Nxb5\n- c2f5: Captures the active bishop, but allows ...Nxf5\n- e1d2: Moves king away from potential checks, but seems passive\n- a1b1: Prepares to develop the rook, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2b5:\n- It targets the weak b6 pawn\n- If Black takes (Nxb5), White can play Bxb5 winning a pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Bxb6 winning a pawn\n- It also prevents any ...Nc4 ideas from Black\n\nThe move e2b5 is the most forcing and creates immediate threats while maintaining White's initiative. It's the most accurate way to exploit Black's weaknesses.\n\n```\ne2b5\n```"
