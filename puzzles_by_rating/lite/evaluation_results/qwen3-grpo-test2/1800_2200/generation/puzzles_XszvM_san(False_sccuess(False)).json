When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, pawns and king. Black has a rook, knight, pawns and king. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g6\n- White has a rook on d6 controlling the 6th rank\n- Black has a knight on h4 threatening to jump to f3 or g2\n- White's king is on d3, somewhat exposed\n- Black's rook on f2 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6d8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- d6g6: Captures the black king, but it's not there (king is on g6)\n- g5h5: Moves the rook away from attack but doesn't press advantage\n- d3e4: Moves king towards center but exposes to checks\n- f4f5: Pushes pawn but allows ...Nf3+\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6g6:\n- It's a discovered check from the rook on g5\n- Black must move the king, but all squares are bad:\n  - Kh5 allows Rg5+\n  - Kf7 allows Rg7+\n  - Kf5 allows Rg5+\n- After any king move, White can follow up with Rg5+ winning material\n\nThis is a forcing sequence that leads to immediate material gain or checkmate. All other moves don't create such immediate threats.\n\n```\nd6g6\n```"
