When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and pawns vs White's bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's knight is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's bishop on a7 is very active\n- Black's knight on f7 is well placed\n- Black's king is more exposed than White's\n- Pawn structure is complex with potential passed pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7h8: Knight retreat, but seems passive\n- f7d8: Similar to h8, not improving position\n- f7h6: Attacks the h5 pawn, but allows White to play Kf3\n- f7g5: Centralizes knight, attacks e4 pawn\n- d6d7: King moves towards center, but exposes to checks\n- e4e3: Pushes passed pawn, but White can capture with Kxe3\n\n4. Best move seems to be f7g5:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the e4 pawn which is weak\n- Prepares to support the a4 pawn's advance\n- If White takes the knight with Kxg5, Black can play a3 creating a passed pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with ...a3 or ...h5\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to consolidate. f7g5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nf7g5\n```"
