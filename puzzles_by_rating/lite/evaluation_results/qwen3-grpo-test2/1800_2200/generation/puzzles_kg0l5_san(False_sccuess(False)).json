When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and rook vs White's queen and rook. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook on e2 and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on b1\n- Black's rook on e2 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5\n- White's queen on f3 is somewhat restricted\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e2e1: Rook checks the king, but White can just take the rook\n- e2e3: Attacks the queen, but White can move it\n- b6d8: Moves the bishop to a safer square\n- b5b4: Advances the passed pawn\n- e7e5: Centralizes the bishop\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2e3:\n- It attacks the queen which is White's most active piece\n- If queen moves, Black can play b5b4 advancing the passed pawn\n- If White takes the rook (Qxe3), Black can play b5b4 with a strong passed pawn\n- It maintains pressure while keeping all pieces active\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow White to consolidate. e2e3 is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for White.\n\n```\ne2e3\n```"
