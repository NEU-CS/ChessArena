When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's king is very active on f6\n- Black's king is on d7, somewhat restricted\n- Black has a passed h-pawn that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed a-pawn that needs to be watched\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7e8: Moves king towards center but away from action\n- d7d6: Keeps king more active\n- h4h3: Advances the passed pawn\n- c7c5: Creates a passed pawn on queenside\n\n4. Best move seems to be h4h3:\n- Advances the dangerous passed pawn\n- White can't stop it (g2g3 would allow h3h2)\n- If White tries to capture with f4h2, Black can play h3h2 and the pawn promotes\n- The h-pawn is more dangerous than White's a-pawn\n\nOther moves either don't make progress or allow White to consolidate. Advancing the h-pawn creates immediate threats that White must deal with.\n\n```\nh4h3\n```"
