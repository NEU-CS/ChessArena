When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h6 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black has a knight on b4 attacking White's pawn on d5\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black has a pawn on g2 that could promote\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6h8: Queen retreat, but seems passive\n- h6f8: Queen checks the king, but Black can block with ...Qe8\n- c3b5: Knight takes the dangerous b4 knight\n- d5e6: Pushing the passed pawn\n- h4h5: Pushing the h-pawn to create threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3b5:\n- Removes the dangerous b4 knight\n- If Black takes the knight with ...axb5, White can play d5e6 opening lines against Black's king\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure\n- It's the most forcing move in the position\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or are too passive. c3b5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nc3b5\n```"
