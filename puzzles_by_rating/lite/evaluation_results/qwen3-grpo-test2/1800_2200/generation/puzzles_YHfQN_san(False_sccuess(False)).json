When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop and pawns. Black is down a queen for a rook, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen is very active on d3\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's knight on e4 is under attack by White's pawn on h4\n- Black's rook on e5 is pinned to the king by White's bishop on c2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f6: Moves the knight to safety but allows White to play Qd3e4 winning the knight\n- e4d6: Moves the knight but it's still under attack\n- e5h5: Unpins the rook but leaves the knight hanging\n- c5e3: Attacks the queen but allows Qd3e3 winning the rook\n- e8e7: Moves the king towards the center but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4g3:\n- It saves the knight by moving it to safety\n- The knight on g3 attacks White's pawn on h4\n- It maintains the pin on White's bishop\n- After Ng3, if Qd3e4 then Nxe4 wins the queen for the knight\n\nThis seems like the most active way to defend while maintaining some counterplay. The knight on g3 is very strong, attacking h4 and pinning the bishop on c2.\n\n```\ne4g3\n```"
