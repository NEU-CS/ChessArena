When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White is down material but has some compensation with the active rook on f5 and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's rook on f5 is very active\n- Black's queen on b6 is controlling important squares\n- White has a passed pawn on b4 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5f8: Rook check, but Black can block with Qb7\n- c4e6: Bishop takes knight, but Black can play Qxe6\n- b2g7: Bishop check, but Black can play Kxg7\n- c4d5: Centralizing the bishop and attacking the rook\n- b4b5: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be c4d5:\n- Centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks the black rook on e5\n- If Black moves the rook, we can play b4b5 pushing the passed pawn\n- If Black takes the bishop (Qxd5), we can play b4b5 creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- Maintains all our pieces active while limiting Black's options\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish as much or allow Black to consolidate. c4d5 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nc4d5\n```"
