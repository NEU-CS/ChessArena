When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is down material but has some compensation with the bishop.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has passed pawns on d6 and g6 that could be dangerous\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed\n- Black's bishop is currently blocking the g6 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h6: Attacks the g6 pawn but allows White to push d6-d7\n- g7f6: Centralizes the bishop but doesn't address the pawns\n- d7c6: Captures the d6 pawn immediately\n- d7e8: Moves the king towards the center\n\n4. Best move seems to be d7c6:\n- It eliminates White's most advanced passed pawn\n- After dxc6, Black can play Bg7 to stop the g6 pawn\n- White can't push g6-g7 because Bg7 would capture it\n- Black's king can then move towards the center to help stop any remaining pawns\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawns or allow White to make progress with the pawns. d7c6 is the most forcing and concrete way to improve Black's position.\n\n```\nd7c6\n```"
