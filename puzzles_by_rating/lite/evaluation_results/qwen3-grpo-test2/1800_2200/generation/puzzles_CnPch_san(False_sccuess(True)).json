Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's queen is very active on e7\n- Black's queen on b1 is not very active\n- White has a passed pawn on h4 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a pawn on e4 that's blocking White's knight\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7f8: Queen checks the king, but Black can just take the queen with Kxf8\n- e7d6: Centralizes the queen and attacks the e4 pawn\n- d4e6: Knight moves to attack the g7 king\n- h4h5: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4e6:\n- The knight check forces the king to move (only legal response is Kf7)\n- After Kf7, White can play Qe7-f6+ winning the h6 pawn\n- Even if Black doesn't take the knight, White gains time and initiative\n- It's a forcing move that disrupts Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't accomplish as much or allow Black to consolidate. The knight check is the most forcing and disruptive move in the position.\n\n```\nd4e6\n```"

Candidate moves:\nOnly legal move is h3g4 (king moves to g4)\n\n4. Evaluating h3g4:\n- Gets the king more active\n- Covers the h5 square against potential black queen checks\n- Prepares to support the h-pawn's advance\n- Moves away from potential checks along the h-file\n- After h3g4, White can consider pushing h4-h5 to create threats\n\n5. Alternatives:\nThere are no other legal moves - h3g4 is the only option.\n\nThe move h3g4 improves White's king position and prepares to advance the h-pawn, creating threats while maintaining control of key squares. It's the only move available and is clearly the best in the position.\n\n```\nh3g4\n```"
