When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on g4\n- Black's queen on e5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White's rook on a6 is tied to defending the a-pawn\n- Black's rook on f8 is semi-trapped\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e5g7: Queen checks the king, but White can just move away\n- e5f4: Centralizes queen and attacks the g4 king\n- h1h4: Rook lift to attack the king\n- c5c4: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5f4:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Puts pressure on the g4 king\n- If White takes the queen (Qxf4), Black can play h1h4+ winning the rook\n- If White doesn't take, Black can continue attacking\n- Maintains all options for the rook and pawn\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to consolidate. e5f4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\ne5f4\n```"
