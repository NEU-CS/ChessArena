When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on c1\n- White's queen is centralized on d5\n- Black's rook on g6 is controlling the g-file\n- White's king is exposed on a4\n- Black has passed pawns on a5 and b5\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- a4b5: Captures the pawn but allows Qc1b2+ winning the bishop\n- a4a5: Moves king away but doesn't address threats\n- a4b3: Moves king towards center but still leaves it exposed\n- d5b5: Captures the pawn with queen, but allows Qc1b2+ winning the bishop\n- c4b5: Captures the pawn with bishop, keeping queen protected\n\n4. Best move is c4b5 because:\n- It captures the dangerous passed pawn\n- The bishop is protected by the queen\n- After Qc1b2+, White can play Qd5b5 winning the queen back\n- It maintains material equality while removing a passed pawn\n\n```\nc4b5\n```"
