When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- White has a bishop on c4 controlling important squares\n- Black's queen on f5 is active but potentially vulnerable\n- White's knight on e4 is very active\n- Black's knight on e5 is well placed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f6: Attacks the queen and threatens to win material\n- c4d5: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the e5 knight\n- c2a4: Prepares to double rooks on the a-file\n- c1h6: Attacks the g7 pawn and opens lines\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4f6:\n- It directly attacks Black's queen\n- If Black moves the queen, White can play c4d5 winning the e5 knight\n- If Black takes the knight (Qxf6), White can play c4e6+ forking king and rook\n- It maintains White's active piece play while putting pressure on Black\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. e4f6 is the most forcing and disruptive move.\n\n```\ne4f6\n```"
