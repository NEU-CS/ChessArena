When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal, but Black has a passed pawn on b2 that's very dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's b2 pawn is one square from promotion\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's bishop on h7 is very active\n- White's knight on c4 is blocking the b2 pawn's promotion\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b2c1: Promotes the pawn to a queen, but White can play Nxc1\n- b2a1: Promotes to a queen, but White can play Bxa1\n- b2b1: Promotes to a queen, but White can play Rxb1\n- h7g6: Moves the bishop to attack the f5 square\n- d7e5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the c4 knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be b2c1:\n- It forces White to take the pawn with Nxc1\n- Then Black can play Bg6, attacking the f5 square and threatening to win material\n- Even if White doesn't take the pawn, the threat of promotion is very strong\n\nThe immediate promotion is the most forcing move and creates maximum problems for White. Other moves like h7g6 or d7e5 are good but don't have the same immediate impact.\n\n```\nb2c1\n```"
