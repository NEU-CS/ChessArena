When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a rook on f5 controlling the f-file\n- Black's bishop on d4 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black has a passed pawn on g4\n- White has a passed pawn on a4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3h6: Bishop takes pawn, but allows Black to play ...Rf1+ winning the bishop\n- e2g4: Captures the dangerous passed pawn, but allows ...Bxg4\n- e2f3: Blocks the f-file and attacks the rook\n- a4a5: Advances the passed pawn\n- g2g3: Stops the g4 pawn but weakens the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2f3:\n- Blocks the active Black rook on f5\n- Attacks the rook, forcing it to move\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- After ...Rxf3, White can play Qd3 winning the bishop on d4\n- If Black moves the rook elsewhere, White can play Qd3 attacking the bishop\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or allow Black to maintain pressure. e2f3 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\ne2f3\n```"
