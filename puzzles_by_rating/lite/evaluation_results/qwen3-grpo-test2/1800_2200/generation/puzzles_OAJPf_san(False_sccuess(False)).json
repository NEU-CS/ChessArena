When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a king and pawns, Black has a king and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is more active (d5 vs White's e3)\n- Black has a passed pawn on c6\n- White has pawns on a4, d4, f4, g4, h4\n- Black has pawns on a5, c6, f5, g6\n- White's king is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e3f3: Moves king towards center but doesn't address any threats\n- e3d3: Moves king towards black's passed pawn, but allows ...c5\n- e3f2: Retreats king, seems passive\n- e3e2: Similar to f2, passive\n- e3d2: Moves king away from action\n- g4f5: Captures black's pawn, but allows ...g5 trapping the f-pawn\n- h4h5: Advances pawn but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- g4g5: Creates a passed pawn and opens lines\n\n4. Best move is g4g5:\n- Creates a passed pawn that can be advanced\n- Opens the g-file which might be useful later\n- Prevents black from playing ...g5 to trap the f-pawn\n- Maintains flexibility for the king\n- After ...fxg5, White can play h4h5 creating another passed pawn\n\nThe move g4g5 is the most active and creates long-term winning chances by creating passed pawns.\n\n```\ng4g5\n```"
