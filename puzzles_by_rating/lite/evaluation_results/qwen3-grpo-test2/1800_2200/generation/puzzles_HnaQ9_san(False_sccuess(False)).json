When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Bishop, Pawn, King\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, 3 Pawns, King\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with Bishop vs Queen)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's pawn on f7 is very dangerous and could promote\n- Black's queen on b1 is active but not immediately threatening\n- White's king is exposed on h3\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g8h8: Moves king to corner, but doesn't address f7 pawn\n- g8f8: Moves king towards center, but still doesn't stop f7 pawn\n- g8h7: Moves king towards f7 pawn, but allows f7f8 promotion\n- g8g7: Keeps king near f7 pawn, but still allows f7f8\n- g8f7: Captures the dangerous f7 pawn!\n\n4. Best move is g8f7 because:\n- It eliminates the dangerous passed pawn\n- After Kxf7, Black can play Qb1d3+ winning the bishop\n- Even if White doesn't take, Black can play Qb1d3 attacking the bishop\n- Other king moves allow f7f8 promotion which would be disastrous\n\nThe immediate capture of the f7 pawn is the most forcing and best move.\n\n```\ng8f7\n```"
