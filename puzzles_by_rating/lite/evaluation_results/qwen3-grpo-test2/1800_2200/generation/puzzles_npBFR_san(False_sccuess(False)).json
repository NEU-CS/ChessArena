When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and knight.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on f6\n- Black's queen is very active on e1\n- Black's knight on c5 is well placed\n- White's queen on g7 is threatening to capture the h7 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e1e4: Centralizes the queen and attacks the rook on d3\n- c5d7: Moves the knight to defend the h7 pawn\n- e1h4: Checks the king and forces it to move\n- e1e5: Attacks the f6 king directly\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1e4 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the rook on d3\n- If White takes the queen (Qxe4), Black can play Nxe4 winning the exchange\n- If White moves the rook, Black can play Qxh7 winning a pawn\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while improving the queen's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or don't improve Black's position as much. e1e4 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\ne1e4\n```"
