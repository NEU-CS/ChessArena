When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and bishop vs White's knight and bishop - material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on e4\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White's king is castled but Black hasn't castled yet\n- Black's knight on e5 is very active\n- White's bishop on f4 is pinning the e5 knight to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8g8 (castling) - gets the king to safety but allows Bxe5\n- e5g4 - attacks the f2 pawn and breaks the pin\n- d8e7 - connects rooks and prepares to castle\n- e5f3 - centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be e5g4:\n- Breaks the pin immediately\n- Attacks the f2 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If White takes the knight (Bxg4), Black can play Qxg4 and White's passed e-pawn becomes less dangerous\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with ...h5 or ...Qe7\n\nOther moves either don't address the pin or allow White to maintain the pin. e5g4 is the most active and disruptive move.\n\n```\ne5g4\n```"
