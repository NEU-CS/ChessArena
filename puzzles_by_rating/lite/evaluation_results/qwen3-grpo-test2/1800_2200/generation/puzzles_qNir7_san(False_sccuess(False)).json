When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on c3\n- White's rook is active on g5\n- Black's rook on c4 is controlling the c-file\n- White has a passed pawn on g4\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5g8: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- g5g6: Attacks the e4 pawn, but allows Black to defend\n- e3f4: King moves towards center, but exposes to checks\n- f2f4: Pushes passed pawn, but allows ...e3 winning the f2 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g5e5:\n- Attacks the e4 pawn directly\n- If Black takes rook with ...c4e4, then f2f4 wins the e4 pawn\n- If Black moves king, we can take the e4 pawn next move\n- Maintains rook activity while putting pressure on Black's position\n\nThis seems most forcing and creates immediate threats while maintaining material equality.\n\n```\ng5e5\n```"
