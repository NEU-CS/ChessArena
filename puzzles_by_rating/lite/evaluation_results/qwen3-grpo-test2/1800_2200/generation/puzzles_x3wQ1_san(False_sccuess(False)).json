When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a queen on h4 attacking g2\n- White's knight on d4 is very active\n- Black's bishop on b5 is pinning White's knight on d2 to the queen on d1\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's king is on g8 with some pawn cover\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4e6: Centralizes the knight but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d2e4: Breaks the pin but allows Qxg2\n- d1h5: Moves the queen to safety while attacking the queen\n- d1e2: Moves the queen to safety but blocks the bishop\n- g1h1: Moves the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be d1h5:\n- Gets the queen to safety away from the pin\n- Attacks Black's queen, forcing it to move\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- After Qxh5, White can play Nxe6 winning a pawn\n- If Black moves the queen elsewhere, White maintains the initiative\n\nOther moves either don't address the pin or allow immediate material loss. d1h5 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nd1h5\n```"
