When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on a8\n- White's queen is very active on f3\n- Black has a bishop on c5 controlling important squares\n- White has a knight on b3 that could be useful\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3f7: Queen check, but Black can block with Qf7\n- f3h5: Attacks the h7 pawn, but doesn't seem decisive\n- b3c5: Captures the bishop, but after Qxc5 White's queen becomes less active\n- a1a4: Prepares to double rooks on the a-file\n- f3e2: Centralizes the queen and prepares to bring it to d3\n\n4. Best move seems to be b3c5:\n- Wins the bishop for a knight\n- After Qxc5, White can play Qd3 attacking the rook on f8\n- Black's king remains exposed\n- White maintains active piece play\n\nThis is the most forcing and advantageous move, winning material while maintaining initiative.\n\n```\nb3c5\n```"
