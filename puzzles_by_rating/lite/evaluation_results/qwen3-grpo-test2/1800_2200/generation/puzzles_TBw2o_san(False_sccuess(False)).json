When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black's knight on d5 is very active\n- White's rook on e5 is putting pressure on Black's position\n- Black's queen on e7 is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5c7: Centralizing the knight and attacking the rook on e5\n- e7e8: Moving the queen to safety while connecting rooks\n- d5f4: Attacking the queen and threatening to jump to e2\n- c8c4: Pinning the d4 pawn to the king\n\n4. Evaluating the best move:\n- d5c7 looks very strong as it centralizes the knight and attacks the rook. After d5c7, if White moves the rook, Black can play Qe8+ winning the exchange.\n- e7e8 is safe but doesn't create any threats.\n- d5f4 is tempting but allows White to play Qg3 defending.\n- c8c4 is interesting but White can just play d5.\n\nThe most forcing and best move is d5c7, creating immediate threats and improving Black's piece activity. White has no good way to defend against the threats arising from this move.\n\n```\nd5c7\n```"
