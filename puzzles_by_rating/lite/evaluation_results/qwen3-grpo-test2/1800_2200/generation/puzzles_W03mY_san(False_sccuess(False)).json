When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a bishop on h6 that's very active\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White has a passed pawn on b4\n- Black's queen on d7 is somewhat restricted\n- White's queen on g3 is eyeing the g7 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8f7: Gets the king to safety but blocks the f-file\n- h8g6: Moves king towards center but still exposed\n- f8e8: Centralizes the rook but doesn't address king safety\n- d7e5: Centralizes the queen but allows Bg5+\n- b6c5: Captures the b4 pawn but loses a bishop after Bxc5\n\n4. Best move seems to be h8f7:\n- Gets the king to relative safety\n- Prepares to connect rooks\n- Prevents any immediate checks\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- After Kf7, Black can consider Qe5 or Rfe8 next\n\nOther moves either leave the king exposed or don't address the immediate concerns. The pawn capture b6c5 is tempting but loses material after Bxc5.\n\n```\nh8f7\n```"
