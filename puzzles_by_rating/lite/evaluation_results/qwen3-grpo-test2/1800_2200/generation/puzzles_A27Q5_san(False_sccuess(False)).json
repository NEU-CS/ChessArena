When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen, pawns and king. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on h6\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black has a knight on e4 controlling important squares\n- White's queen on e3 is very active\n- Black's rook on f8 is not very active\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- h6h7: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n- h6g7: Moves king towards center but still exposed\n- h6h5: Moves king forward, potentially dangerous\n- e4g5: Active knight move attacking f3 and e4\n\n4. Best move is e4g5 because:\n- It's the most active move, bringing the knight to a strong square\n- Attacks the f3 square which is important for White's king safety\n- If White takes the knight (Qxg5), Black can play Qd7+ winning the e5 pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black maintains pressure\n- It's more active than any king move which would just shuffle the king\n\nThe other king moves either don't improve Black's position or move the king into potential danger. e4g5 is the most challenging move for White to face.\n\n```\ne4g5\n```"
