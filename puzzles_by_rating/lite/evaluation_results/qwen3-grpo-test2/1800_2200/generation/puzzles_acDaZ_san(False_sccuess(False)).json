When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, knight, bishop and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d5\n- Black's rook on e1 is very active\n- Black's queen on h6 is awkwardly placed\n- White has a knight on e6 that's very strong\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e1e6: Capturing the strong knight, but after Qxe6 Black's rook is trapped\n- h6f8: Moving the queen to a safer square while maintaining pressure\n- g4e6: Capturing the knight with the bishop, but Qxe6 wins the rook\n- a6a5: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e1e6:\n- It removes White's strong knight\n- After Qxe6, Black can play Qf7 attacking the queen\n- White would likely play Qe5, then Black can play Qf6 maintaining the attack\n- This leads to a dynamic position where Black's active pieces compensate for the material deficit\n\nThe move e1e6 is the most forcing and creates complications that favor Black's active pieces.\n\n```\ne1e6\n```"
