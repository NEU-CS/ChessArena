When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a strong passed pawn on d5\n- Black's king is exposed on e8\n- White's queen on b5 is very active\n- Black's knight on f6 is under attack by White's queen\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- e7f7: Blocks the queen's diagonal but leaves king exposed\n- f6d5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n- d6e5: Blocks the queen's diagonal and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6d5 because:\n- It eliminates White's dangerous passed pawn\n- After Qxd5, Black can play Qe6 attacking the queen\n- If White doesn't take, Black gains time to consolidate\n- It's the most active move in the position\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or are too passive. f6d5 is the most forcing and improves Black's position.\n\n```\nf6d5\n```"
