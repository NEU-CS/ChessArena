When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's rook on f4 is active but potentially vulnerable\n- White's king is on g3, also exposed\n- Black's queen on a5 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a5d8: Centralizing the queen and attacking the rook on a8\n- f4f3: Checking the king and forcing it to move\n- e7f6: Developing the knight and attacking the e5 pawn\n- a5c3: Attacking the bishop on d2\n\n4. Best move seems to be f4f3:\n- It's a check that forces White's king to move\n- After Kgf3, Black can follow up with Qa5d8, winning the rook on a8\n- Even if White finds a better defense, Black gains time and initiative\n- It's more forcing than the queen moves which don't immediately threaten anything\n\nOther moves like a5d8 are good but don't force White to respond immediately. The check is more forcing and gives Black the initiative.\n\n```\nf4f3\n```"
