When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and knight vs White's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on g6 that could be dangerous\n- Black's knight on h4 is very active\n- Black's bishop on d2 is controlling important squares\n- White's king is exposed on h1\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on f8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4g6: Captures the dangerous passed pawn, but allows White to play Rf7 attacking the rook\n- d2h6: Checks the king, but White can just take the bishop\n- d2e3: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the f2 pawn\n- f8h8: Moves the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be h4g6:\n- Eliminates the dangerous passed pawn\n- After Rf7, Black can play Bg5 attacking the rook\n- If White doesn't take the rook, Black has won a pawn\n- The knight is very active on g6\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or don't maximize Black's active pieces. The immediate capture is most forcing and solves the most pressing problem.\n\n```\nh4g6\n```"
