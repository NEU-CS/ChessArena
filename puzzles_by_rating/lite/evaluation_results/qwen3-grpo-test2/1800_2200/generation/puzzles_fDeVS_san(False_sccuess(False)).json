When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and pawns vs White's bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's bishop is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on f4\n- Black's king is on e7, which is somewhat exposed\n- Black's knight on c5 is very active\n- White has a passed pawn on e6 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7f6: Gets the king closer to the action but exposes it to checks\n- c5e4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the king\n- c5d3: Attacks the bishop and cuts off White's king\n- h5h4: Pushes the pawn but doesn't address immediate concerns\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5d3:\n- Attacks the bishop on c4\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play e7d6 centralizing the king\n- If White takes the knight (Bxd3), Black can play e7d6 and the king becomes active\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Prevents White from playing Kf5 which would activate the king\n\nOther moves either don't address the position as effectively or expose Black's king too much. c5d3 is the most active and flexible move.\n\n```\nc5d3\n```"
