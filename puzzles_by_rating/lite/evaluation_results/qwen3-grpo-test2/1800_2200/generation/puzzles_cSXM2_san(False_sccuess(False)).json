When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal, but Black has a passed pawn on d4 that could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's bishop on e1 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on g2\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4 that could promote\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g2h3: Moves king away from potential checks but doesn't address the d4 pawn\n- c1h6: Bishop move that attacks the f6 pawn but allows d3\n- b1d3: Captures the dangerous d4 pawn but allows Bxd3\n- h2h4: Advances the h-pawn but doesn't address immediate concerns\n\n4. Best move seems to be b1d3:\n- It eliminates Black's dangerous passed pawn\n- After Bxd3, White can play Bxd3 keeping material equal\n- It opens the b-file for White's rook (if it were on the board)\n- It prevents Black from pushing d3 which would be very dangerous\n\nThe move b1d3 solves the most pressing problem in the position (the passed d4 pawn) while maintaining material equality. Other moves either don't address the passed pawn or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nb1d3\n```"
