Looking at the legal moves:\n- g2g3: Moves king away from check but into a discovered check from Black's queen\n- g2f2: Moves king towards center but still leaves rook pinned\n- g2h1: Moves king to corner but still leaves rook pinned\n- f1g3: Moves rook to block queen's check but allows Rh3g3+\n- h2g3: Moves pawn to block queen's check and protects king\n\n4.
