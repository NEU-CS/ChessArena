When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on g5 that's very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's bishop on e7 is blocked by its own pawn on f6\n- White has a passed pawn on a3 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Moves the king to safety but seems passive\n- d8d7: Connects rooks and prepares to double on the d-file\n- e7d6: Opens the bishop's diagonal and attacks the knight on g5\n- f6e4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the e4 knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7d6 because:\n- It opens the bishop's diagonal towards White's king\n- It attacks the active g5 knight\n- It prepares to bring the rook to d8 to double on the d-file\n- It maintains control over key squares\n- It doesn't create any weaknesses in Black's position\n\nOther moves either don't address the active White pieces or are too passive. e7d6 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\ne7d6\n```"
