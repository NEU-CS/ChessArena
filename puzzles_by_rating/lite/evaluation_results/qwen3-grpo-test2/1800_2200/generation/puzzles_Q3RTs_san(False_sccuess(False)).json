When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on g4, attacking f3 and h2\n- White's king is still in the center\n- Black has a knight on f6 controlling key squares\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black's bishop on d8 is blocked by pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g5: Attacks the queen but allows Qxg5\n- e3h6: Checks the king but Black can block with g7\n- d3h7: Interesting sacrifice, but Black can play Qxh7\n- d4e5: Central break, attacking the knight\n- e1g1: Castling to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4e5:\n- Opens the diagonal for the bishop on d3\n- Attacks the knight on f6\n- If Black takes (Nxe5), White can play Bxg4 winning the queen\n- If Black doesn't take, White gains space and initiative\n- Protects against Qxh2+ as the pawn on h2 is no longer weak\n\nOther moves either don't address the queen's activity or don't improve White's position as much. d4e5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nd4e5\n```"
