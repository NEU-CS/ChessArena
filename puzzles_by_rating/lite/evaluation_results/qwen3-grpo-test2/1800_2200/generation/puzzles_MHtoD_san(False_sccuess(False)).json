When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black's rook on d8 is blocked by own queen on d7\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f7f8: Moves king to corner, but seems passive\n- f7e7: Moves king towards center but still exposed\n- f7e6: Moves king forward, but into potential danger\n- g8g6: Moves rook to attack white queen\n\n4. Best move is g8g6 because:\n- It directly attacks the active white queen on h5\n- If White takes the rook (Qxg6), Black can play Qd7e6+ winning the bishop on e3\n- If White moves queen away, Black gains time to reorganize\n- It's the most active move in a difficult position\n\nThe other king moves are too passive and allow White to maintain pressure. g8g6 is the only move that creates counterplay.\n\n```\ng8g6\n```"
