When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is more active (f5 vs White's e3)\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3 that's very dangerous\n- White's pawns are mostly fixed (b3, g2, d4)\n- Black's a-pawn is advanced but blocked by White's b3 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f5g6: Moves king away from center, not helpful\n- f5f6: Similar to g6, not improving position\n- f5e6: Centralizes king but doesn't address passed pawn\n- f5g5: Puts king near h5 pawn but doesn't help\n- f5g4: Attacks g3 pawn but exposes king\n- h5h4: Advances pawn but doesn't create threats\n- a5a4: Advances passed a-pawn but it's blocked\n- c3c2: Advances passed c-pawn, creating immediate threat\n\n4. Best move is c3c2:\n- Creates an immediate passed pawn threat\n- White must respond to stop promotion (Kd2 or Kd3)\n- After Kd2, Black can play Ke4 attacking d4 pawn\n- After Kd3, Black can play Ke4 again with threats\n- This is the most forcing and dangerous move\n\n```\nc3c2\n```"
