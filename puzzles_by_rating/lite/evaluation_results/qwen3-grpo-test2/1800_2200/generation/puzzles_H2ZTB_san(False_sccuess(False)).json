When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal, but White has a more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a strong bishop on g5 pinning the f6 pawn to the king\n- Black has a knight on b4 attacking White's pawn on d2\n- White's knight on d6 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e8: Centralizing the knight and attacking the queen\n- g5d8: Moving the bishop to safety while maintaining pressure\n- g4c8: Moving the bishop to attack the knight on b4\n- f1f8: Centralizing the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6e8 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks Black's queen on h6\n- If Black moves the queen, White can play Bxd8 winning the exchange\n- If Black takes the knight (Qxe8), then Bxd8 wins the queen\n- It maintains all of White's threats while improving piece placement\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or don't improve White's position as much. The knight move is the most forcing and creates immediate problems for Black.\n\n```\nd6e8\n```"
