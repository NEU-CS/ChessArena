When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and queen vs Black's bishop, pawn and queen. Material is roughly equal, but Black has an extra pawn.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on h6\n- White's king is exposed on g3\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n- White has a passed pawn on c4\n- Black's bishop on e6 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3f3: Moves king to safer square but blocks bishop\n- e2h5: Attacks the queen but allows Qxh5\n- e2f3: Centralizes queen and defends king\n- d1a4: Attacks the a5 pawn but seems slow\n- e4e5: Pushes passed pawn but allows Qxh5\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2f3 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Defends the king on g3\n- Prepares to support the e4 pawn push\n- Maintains flexibility to attack the queen later\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics for Black\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or allow Black to gain an advantage. e2f3 is the most solid and active move.\n\n```\ne2f3\n```"
