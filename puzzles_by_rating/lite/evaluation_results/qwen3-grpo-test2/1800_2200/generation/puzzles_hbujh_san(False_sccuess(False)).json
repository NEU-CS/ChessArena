When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on f3\n- White's rook on b8 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White has a knight on e3 that could be useful\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b8h8: Rook lift to attack the h7 pawn, but Black can defend\n- e3f5: Centralizing the knight, attacking g7 and e7\n- b2g7: Bishop move to attack the weak h7 pawn\n- b2e5: Centralizing the bishop, controlling key squares\n\n4. Most promising move seems to be b2e5 because:\n- It centralizes the bishop\n- Controls the f6 square, preventing Black's rook from moving there\n- Puts pressure on the d4 square\n- Prepares to double rooks on the e-file\n- Maintains flexibility for the knight on e3\n\nOther moves either don't improve piece activity or allow Black to consolidate. b2e5 is the most active and flexible move, improving White's position while maintaining all options.\n\n```\nb2e5\n```"
