When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on b7\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's queen on e6 is very active\n- White's knight on f5 is threatening to jump to g7 or e7\n- Black's rook on h7 is vulnerable to attacks\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6f5: Capturing the knight immediately, but after Qxf5 Black's king remains exposed\n- e6d5: Capturing the dangerous passed pawn, but allows Ng7+ winning the rook\n- h7h6: Moving the rook to safety while maintaining pressure on the h-file\n- e5e4: Pushing the pawn to create threats and open lines\n\n4. Best move seems to be e6d5:\n- It eliminates White's dangerous passed pawn\n- After Ng7+ Kc8, Black can play Qxd5 with a slight material advantage\n- It maintains Black's active queen while reducing White's counterplay\n\nThe move e6d5 solves the most pressing problem (the passed pawn) while maintaining Black's active piece play. Other moves either don't address the passed pawn or allow dangerous tactics.\n\n```\ne6d5\n```"
