When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on e5 that's very active\n- Black's queen on e4 is exposed and could be vulnerable\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning the e2 pawn to the queen\n- White's king is still in the center\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4f3: Capturing the knight on f3 would win material, but White can play Qd2 defending\n- e4e5: Capturing the active knight on e5, but White can play Qd2 attacking the queen\n- g4f3: Moving the bishop to capture the knight, but White can play Qd2\n- e8d7: Moving the king to safety while connecting rooks\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4f3:\n- It wins a knight for a queen (material gain)\n- After Qd2, Black can play Qf4 maintaining the pin\n- White doesn't have any immediate threats\n- It improves Black's piece activity\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow White to maintain pressure. e4f3 is the most forcing and best move.\n\n```\ne4f3\n```"
