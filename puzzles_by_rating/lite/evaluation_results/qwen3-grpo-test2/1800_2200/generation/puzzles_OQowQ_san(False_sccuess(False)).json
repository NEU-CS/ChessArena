When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, knight and bishop vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. White is down material but has some compensation with the active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on f7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on b8\n- Black's rook on d8 is pinned to the queen on f8 by White's queen on a6\n- Black's bishop on d5 is blocked by its own pawn on f5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7h8: Captures the rook but allows Black to play Qxh8\n- f7d8: Captures the pinned rook, winning material\n- a6c8: Moves the queen to safety but doesn't capitalize on the pin\n- e3h6: Moves the bishop but doesn't address the main opportunity\n\n4. Best move is f7d8 because:\n- It captures the pinned rook\n- Black cannot take back because Qxh8 would lose the queen to Qxh8\n- After Nxd8, White is up material (queen vs rook+bishop)\n- Black has no immediate threats or checks\n\nAll other moves either don't win material or allow Black to maintain the pin. f7d8 is the most forcing and winning move.\n\n```\nf7d8\n```"
