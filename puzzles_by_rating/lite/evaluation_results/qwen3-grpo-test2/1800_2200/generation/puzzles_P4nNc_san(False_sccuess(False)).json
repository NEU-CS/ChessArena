When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- White has a passed pawn on f6 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a rook on g4 controlling the g-file\n- White's rook on h5 is active\n- Black's bishop on d3 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d3e4: Centralizing the bishop and attacking the f5 pawn\n- g4g5: Pushing the rook to attack the h5 rook\n- d3f5: Capturing the f5 pawn to eliminate White's passed pawn\n- c7c5: Moving the rook to defend the d5 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d3f5:\n- It captures a pawn and eliminates White's dangerous passed pawn\n- After f6xf5, Black can play g4g5 attacking the h5 rook\n- White can't take the bishop because of Rg4xh5\n- This maintains Black's active piece play while reducing White's counterplay\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or allow White to maintain pressure. d3f5 is the most forcing and improves Black's position.\n\n```\nd3f5\n```"
