When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Black is up a queen for a bishop, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on f5\n- White's rook on c7 is under attack by Black's bishop on g7\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black has a knight on h4 threatening to jump to g2\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7c8: Retreating the rook but allows Black to play Qf4+ winning material\n- d4g7: Capturing the bishop but allows Qxg7 winning the rook\n- g2b7: Moving the bishop to defend the rook but allows Qf4+ \n- d1d3: Moving the rook to defend the bishop but allows Qf4+\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4e4:\n- Blocks the queen's diagonal to f4\n- Maintains defense of the rook on c7\n- If Black takes the bishop with Qxg7, White can play Rxc8 winning the rook\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains material equality\n\nThis seems like the most resilient move, maintaining defensive resources while preventing immediate threats.\n\n```\nd4e4\n```"
