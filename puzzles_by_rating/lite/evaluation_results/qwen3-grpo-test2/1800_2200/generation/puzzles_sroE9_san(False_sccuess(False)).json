When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and pawns vs Black's rook, pawns and a passed c-pawn. Material is roughly equal, but Black's passed c-pawn is dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a rook on a4 controlling the a-file\n- White's knight on c5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has a rook on e2 and c3, Black has a rook on c1\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3 that could promote\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c5d7: attacks the rook on a4, but allows Black to push c2\n- c5e6: centralizes the knight but doesn't address the c-pawn\n- c3c4: blocks the c-pawn but allows Black to play ...a3\n- e2e4: centralizes the rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be c5d7:\n- It attacks the rook on a4, forcing Black to move it\n- After ...Ra5, White can play c3c4 stopping the c-pawn\n- If Black tries to push c2, White can play e2e2 to stop it\n- The knight on d7 is very strong, controlling key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or allow Black to make progress with the c-pawn. c5d7 is the most active and forcing move.\n\n```\nc5d7\n```"
