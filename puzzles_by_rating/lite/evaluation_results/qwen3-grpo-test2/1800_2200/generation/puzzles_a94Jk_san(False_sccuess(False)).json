When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, knight and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h6 is very active\n- Black's queen on e3 is centralized but exposed\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n- White's knight on g5 is threatening to jump to f7 or e6\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e3e7: Centralizing the queen and attacking the rook, but allows Qf7+ winning the bishop\n- e3e6: Blocking the knight's diagonal, but Qxg5 is possible\n- e3g5: Capturing the knight, but Qxg5 is forced and Black loses material\n- e3e5: Centralizing the queen and defending the d5 pawn\n- d5d4: Advancing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3e5:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Defends the d5 pawn\n- Keeps options open to go to f4 or d4\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics from White\n- Maintains pressure on the position\n\nOther moves either lose material or allow White to maintain the initiative. e3e5 is the most solid choice.\n\n```\ne3e5\n```"
