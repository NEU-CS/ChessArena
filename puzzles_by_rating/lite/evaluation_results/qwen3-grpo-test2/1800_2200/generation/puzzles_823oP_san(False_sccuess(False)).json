When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black has a bishop on f6 controlling the long diagonal\n- White has a bishop on e4 controlling the dark squares\n- Black's queen on b6 is somewhat loose\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5e8: Queen check, but Black can block with rook\n- h5h7: Attacks the h7 pawn, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- e4h7: Bishop takes pawn, but allows Black to defend\n- c1h6: Bishop move attacking the f8 rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be h5e8:\n- It's a check that forces Black to respond\n- After 26...Rxe8, White can play 27. Bxh6 winning the exchange\n- If 26...Qxe8, then 27. Bxh6 wins the rook on f8\n- Black has no good way to handle the check without losing material\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. h5e8 is the most forcing and wins material.\n\n```\nh5e8\n```"
