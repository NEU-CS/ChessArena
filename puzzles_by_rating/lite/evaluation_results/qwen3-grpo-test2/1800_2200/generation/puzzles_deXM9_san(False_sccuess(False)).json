When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black has a knight on e4 that's very active\n- White's bishop on g5 is pinning the f6 pawn to the king\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has a pawn on h3 that could be weak\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5e7: Capturing the bishop, but after ...Qxe7 White's bishop is lost\n- c4f7: Threatening the rook, but Black can defend with ...Qe7\n- d2f4: Attacking the e4 knight, but Black can play ...Nf6\n- e1g1: Castling to safety, but misses tactical opportunities\n- c3e4: Capturing the strong knight, but Black can play ...Bxe4\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3e4:\n- Wins the active knight on e4\n- If Black recaptures with Bxe4, White can play Bxe4 winning the h3 pawn\n- If Black doesn't recapture, White is up a piece\n- Maintains the pin on f6 after the capture\n\nThis is the most forcing and advantageous move in the position, winning material while maintaining pressure.\n\n```\nc3e4\n```"
