When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a knight on g4 attacking White's bishop on g5\n- White has a bishop on g5 that's very active\n- Black's queen on b6 is eyeing the b2 pawn\n- White's king is exposed due to the open h-file\n- Black has castling rights (kq) while White doesn't\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5d8: Bishop takes rook, but Black can play Qxd8 and we lose the bishop\n- g5e7: Bishop takes knight, but Black can play Qxe7\n- g5h6: Bishop moves away from attack but loses momentum\n- c3d5: Centralizing the knight and attacking the e7 pawn\n- f1f7: Rook lift to put pressure on Black's position\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3d5 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the e7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If Black takes the knight (Nxe7), White can play Bxd8 winning the exchange\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure\n- It's a strong centralizing move that improves White's piece activity\n\nOther moves either don't address the knight on g4 or don't improve White's position as much. c3d5 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
