When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's rook, pawns and a king. Material is roughly equal, but Black's king is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on f8 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is exposed on g3\n- Black's rook on a3 is controlling the a-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8h8: Rook retreat, but seems passive\n- f8f7: Centralizing the rook, but doesn't address threats\n- g3h4: Moving king away from potential checks\n- e6e7: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not very advanced\n- b4b5: Pushing the pawn to create a passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be b4b5:\n- Creates a passed pawn on b5\n- Black's a-pawn is blocked by the new b-pawn\n- Opens the b-file for the rook\n- If Black takes (a4b5), White can play e6e7 creating another passed pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can push b5b6 creating a dangerous passed pawn\n\nThe move b4b5 improves White's pawn structure and creates counterplay, which is essential in this endgame.\n\n```\nb4b5\n```"
