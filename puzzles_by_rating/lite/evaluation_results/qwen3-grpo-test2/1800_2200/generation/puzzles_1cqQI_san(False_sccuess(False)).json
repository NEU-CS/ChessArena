When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen, knight and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on e3\n- Black's bishop on g2 is pinning the knight on g3 to the king on c1\n- Black's queen on h2 is threatening to capture the rook on d7\n- White's rook on d7 is defending the queen\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h2h1: Captures the rook but allows White to play Qxh1\n- g2e4: Moves the bishop to a more active square, maintaining the pin\n- g2d5: Centralizes the bishop and maintains the pin\n- h2g3: Captures the knight but allows Qxg3\n\n4. Best move seems to be g2e4:\n- Maintains the pin on the knight\n- Centralizes the bishop\n- Keeps pressure on White's position\n- If White takes the bishop (Qxe4), Black can play Qxd7 winning the exchange\n- If White doesn't take, Black can continue to press with moves like Qxd7 or h2h1\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to consolidate. g2e4 is the most active and maintains Black's initiative.\n\n```\ng2e4\n```"
