When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on h6\n- White has a rook on g7 controlling the 7th rank\n- Black has a rook on a2 and bishop on f7\n- White's king is on e1, which is somewhat exposed\n- Black has a passed pawn on a6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7g8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- g7h7: Attacks the black king directly\n- g3g6: Centralizes the rook and attacks the e6 pawn\n- e1f2: Gets the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be g7h7:\n- Directly attacks the black king\n- If Black moves Kh5, White can play Rh5+ winning the bishop\n- If Black plays Kg6, White can play Rh6+ winning the bishop\n- If Black does nothing, White can play Rh6+ next move\n- Other moves either don't attack or allow Black to consolidate\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is g7h7, putting immediate pressure on Black's king.\n\n```\ng7h7\n```"
