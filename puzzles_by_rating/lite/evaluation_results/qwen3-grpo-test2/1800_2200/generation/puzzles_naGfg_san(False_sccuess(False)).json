When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, bishop, pawns and rook. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on a6\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocked by its own pawn on e5\n- Black has a passed pawn on b4\n- White has a passed pawn on d6\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- d7d6: Captures the dangerous passed pawn but allows Qa6xd6\n- e6d5: Opens the bishop's diagonal and attacks the bishop on e4\n- f6f4: Pushes the pawn to create threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be e6d5 because:\n- It opens the bishop's diagonal towards White's king\n- It attacks the bishop on e4, forcing it to move\n- It prevents White from playing Bf5, which would be very strong\n- It maintains Black's defensive resources\n\nAfter e6d5, if White plays Bf5, Black can play ...f6f4 creating counterplay. If White moves the bishop, Black can capture the d6 pawn with d7d6.\n\n```\ne6d5\n```"
