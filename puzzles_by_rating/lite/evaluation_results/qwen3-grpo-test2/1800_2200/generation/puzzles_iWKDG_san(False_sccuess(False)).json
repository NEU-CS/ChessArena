When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on e4\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning the knight on g3\n- Black has a passed pawn on c5\n- White's rook on a5 is eyeing the a-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4e6: Bishop takes queen - but White can just take the bishop back\n- g4h3: Bishop moves to h3, maintaining the pin\n- d7d4: Rook moves to d4, attacking the queen\n- c5c4: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g4e6:\n- It forces White to take the bishop (Qxe6)\n- Then Black can play d7d4, attacking the queen\n- After Qe4, Black can play d4e4, winning the queen for a rook\n- Even if White doesn't take, Black maintains the strong bishop\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow White to maintain their advantage. The bishop trade is the most forcing and advantageous line.\n\n```\ng4e6\n```"
