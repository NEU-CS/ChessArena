When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and pawns vs White's rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e4\n- Black's king is on d7, which is somewhat exposed\n- Black has passed pawns on g4 and h4\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n- Black's knight on b7 is not very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7e8: Moves king to safer square but away from action\n- d7d8: Similar to e8, not very active\n- b7d6: Centralizes knight and attacks c5 pawn\n- e6e5: Advances pawn but blocks knight's movement\n- h4h3: Advances passed pawn but may be premature\n- g4g3: More aggressive pawn advance\n\n4. Best move seems to be b7d6 because:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the dangerous c5 pawn\n- Prepares to bring knight to e4 to attack white king\n- Maintains flexibility for king movement\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't improve piece activity or create new weaknesses. The pawn advances are too slow and don't address the immediate need to activate the knight.\n\n```\nb7d6\n```"
