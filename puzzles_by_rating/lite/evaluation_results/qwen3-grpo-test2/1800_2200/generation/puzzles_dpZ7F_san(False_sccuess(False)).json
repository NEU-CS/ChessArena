When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White has a bishop on b5 pinning the knight on d7\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White has castling rights while Black doesn't\n- Black's bishop on g4 is very active\n- White's queen on e2 is somewhat exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d8d7: Moves the queen but doesn't address the pin\n- f6d7: Captures the pinned bishop but allows Bxd7 winning a piece\n- e5d7: Captures the bishop but allows Bxd7\n- e5c6: Moves the knight but doesn't address the pin\n- g4d7: Captures the bishop while maintaining the pin (Bxd7 allows Nxd7 winning the bishop)\n\n4. Best move is g4d7 because:\n- It captures the bishop while maintaining the pin\n- After Bxd7, Black can play Nxd7 winning the bishop back\n- It keeps Black's active bishop on the diagonal\n- It prevents White from castling kingside\n- It maintains Black's active piece play\n\nThe move g4d7 is the most forcing and maintains Black's initiative.\n\n```\ng4d7\n```"
