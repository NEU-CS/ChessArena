When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black has a rook on a2 threatening to capture the h2 pawn\n- White's rook on c7 is very active\n- Black's knight on f5 is well placed\n- White's knight on c6 is centralized\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c7c8: Rook lift, but doesn't accomplish much\n- c7h7: Attacks the h7 pawn, but Black can defend\n- c6e7: Centralizes the knight and attacks the rook on e8\n- c6d4: Attacks the a2 rook and threatens to win material\n- a5a6: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6d4:\n- Attacks the a2 rook directly\n- If Black moves the rook, White can play Nf3 winning the f5 knight\n- If Black plays a2a1, White can play Nf3 winning the rook\n- Maintains all other threats while gaining material\n\nThe move c6d4 is the most forcing and wins material immediately.\n\n```\nc6d4\n```"
