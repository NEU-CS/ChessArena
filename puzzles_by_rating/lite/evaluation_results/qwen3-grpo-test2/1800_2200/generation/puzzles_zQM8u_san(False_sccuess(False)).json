When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has a queen on g3 eyeing the black king\n- Black has a bishop on g6 controlling important squares\n- White has a rook on f1 and bishop on e2\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8h4: Queen move attacking the queen, but White can just move the queen\n- d8g5: Centralizing the queen and attacking the h4 pawn\n- f8f7: Moving the rook to defend the king\n- e4e3: Pushing the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d8g5:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the h4 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If White takes the queen (Qxg5), Black can play Bf5+ winning the rook on f1\n- If White moves the queen, Black can push e4e3 creating threats\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or don't improve Black's position as much. d8g5 is the most active and threatening move.\n\n```\nd8g5\n```"
