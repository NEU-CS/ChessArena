When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on g3 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black's rook on h7 is active\n- White's knight on f3 is under pressure from Black's bishop on d6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g5: Attacks the h7 rook but allows ...Bxg5\n- f3e5: Centralizes the knight but doesn't address the g3 pawn\n- d2a5: Targets the a7 pawn but is too slow\n- b2e5: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the d6 bishop\n- b1c3: Develops the knight and prepares to defend g3\n\n4. Best move seems to be b1c3 because:\n- Develops a piece\n- Prepares Nc3-d5 to challenge Black's center\n- Defends the g3 pawn indirectly (if ...g2 then Nc3-d5+)\n- Keeps options open for the knight on f3\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics for Black\n\nOther moves either don't address the g3 pawn or allow Black to consolidate. b1c3 is the most active and defensive move.\n\n```\nb1c3\n```"
