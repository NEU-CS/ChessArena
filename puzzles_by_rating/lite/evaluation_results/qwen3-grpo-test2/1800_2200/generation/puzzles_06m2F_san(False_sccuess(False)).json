When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, queen, pawns. Black is up a bishop but White has some compensation with the active rook on g4.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h3 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- Black's bishop on b7 is blocked by its own pawn on a7\n- White has a passed pawn on h6\n- Black has a passed pawn on f4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8h7: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- d8e7: Centralizes the queen and defends f6 bishop\n- f6g5: Attacks the active rook on g4\n- f4f3: Advances the passed pawn\n- e4e3: Advances another passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6g5:\n- It attacks the dangerous rook on g4\n- If White moves the rook, Black can play Qd8-e7 defending f6\n- If White takes the bishop (Qxg5), Black can play Qd8-h4+ winning the h3 queen\n- It maintains Black's initiative and keeps White's pieces under pressure\n\nOther moves either don't address the active White pieces or are too passive. f6g5 is the most forcing move.\n\n```\nf6g5\n```"
