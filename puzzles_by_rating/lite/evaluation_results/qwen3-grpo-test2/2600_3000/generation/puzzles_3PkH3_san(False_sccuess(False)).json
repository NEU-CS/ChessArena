When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, pawns. Black has a queen, bishop, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White's queen is very active on d5\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on a4\n- Black's bishop on b5 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5d7: Attacks the f7 pawn and threatens to win material\n- d5e6: Centralizes the queen and attacks the bishop\n- e3e7: Moves the rook to a more active file\n- h2g3: Gets the king to safety\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5d7:\n- It attacks the f7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If Black takes the queen (Qxd7), White can play Qxd7 and then Rxe7 winning the bishop\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Qxf7 winning a pawn\n- It maintains pressure while keeping the queen active\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. d5d7 is the most forcing move that creates concrete advantages.\n\n```\nd5d7\n```"
