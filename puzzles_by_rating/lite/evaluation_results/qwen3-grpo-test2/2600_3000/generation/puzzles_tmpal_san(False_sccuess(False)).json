When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. White is down material but has some compensation with the active queen.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White's queen is very active on e6\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on f4 that could be advanced\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6g8: Queen check, but Black can block with Qg7\n- e6f7: Attacks the g7 queen and threatens to win material\n- c2g6: Bishop move that pins the f7 pawn to the king\n- f4f5: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e6f7:\n- It attacks the black queen on g7\n- If Black moves the queen, White can play Qxg7 winning the queen\n- If Black plays Qg6, White can play Qxg6+ Kxg6 and then Bg6 winning the rook\n- It maintains all of White's threats while increasing pressure\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. e6f7 is the most forcing and dangerous move.\n\n```\ne6f7\n```"
