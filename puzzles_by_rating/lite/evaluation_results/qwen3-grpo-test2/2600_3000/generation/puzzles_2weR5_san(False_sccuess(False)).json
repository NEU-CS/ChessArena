When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook and bishop.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on g5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on h8\n- White has a passed pawn on a4\n- Black's bishop on e8 is blocked by pawns\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- e8e7: Develops the bishop and connects rooks\n- d7d4: Centralizes the queen and attacks the a4 pawn\n- d7g4: Attacks the queen but allows Qxg4\n\n4. Best move seems to be d7d4 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the dangerous a4 pawn\n- If White takes the queen (Qxd4), Black can play Bxd4 winning the exchange\n- If White moves the queen, Black can play Qxa4 winning a pawn\n- It's more active than other options\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or are too passive. d7d4 is the most challenging move for White to face.\n\n```\nd7d4\n```"
