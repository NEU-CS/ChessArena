When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a king and pawns (a7, b5, c4, f7, g7, h7). White has a king and pawns (a3, c3, f4, g2, h2). Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is more active (d6 vs White's d4)\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4\n- White has a passed pawn on f4\n- Black's pawns on b5 and a7 are potential targets\n- White's king is more centralized\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e7: King moves towards center but away from action\n- d6d7: King moves backward, not ideal\n- d6c7: King moves towards a7 pawn\n- d6e6: King moves towards center and f4 pawn\n- d6c6: King moves towards b5 pawn\n- Pawn moves: h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, a7a6, b5b4, h7h5, g7g5, f7f5, a7a5\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6c6:\n- Attacks the b5 pawn which is weak\n- Prepares to support the c4 passed pawn\n- Keeps options to go after White's pawns\n- If White takes b5 pawn (Kc5), Black can play Kc7 and the c4 pawn becomes very strong\n\nOther moves either don't address the pawn structure or move the king away from the action. The pawn moves don't accomplish as much as improving the king position.\n\n```\nd6c6\n```"
