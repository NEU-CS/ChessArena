When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on d6 that's very advanced\n- White's king is exposed on e3\n- Black's rook on d5 is very active\n- White's rook on d3 is blocking the d-pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e7: Advances the passed pawn but allows White to capture it\n- d5d4: Attacks the white rook and opens the d-file for the other rook\n- d5d3: Captures the white rook, but after Kxd3 Black's pawn is lost\n- c7c8: Moves the rook to a more active file\n\n4. Best move seems to be d5d4:\n- Attacks the white rook\n- If White takes the rook (Rxd4), then d6e7 wins the rook back\n- If White moves the rook, Black can play d6e7 next move\n- Maintains pressure while keeping the passed pawn\n\nOther moves either don't make progress or allow White to consolidate. d5d4 is the most forcing move that creates immediate threats.\n\n```\nd5d4\n```"
