When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has pawns on a4, b4, c4, d5, g4.\n\n2. King positions: Black king is on h3, White king on f3. Both kings are active but Black's is slightly more exposed.\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - Black has a passed pawn on e5\n   - White has a passed pawn on d5\n   - The g-pawns are locked (g4 vs g6)\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - h3h4: Moves king towards center but exposes it to checks\n   - h3h2: Moves king to safety but away from action\n   - c7c6: Releases pressure on d5 but weakens b6\n   - e5e4: Advances passed pawn but allows d5d6\n   - c7c5: Challenges d5 pawn directly\n\nAfter considering these:\n- e5e4 seems most promising as it advances Black's passed pawn while maintaining control\n- After e5e4, if White takes d5e4, Black can play c7c5 winning a pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can push e4e3 creating a dangerous passed pawn\n\nThe move e5e4 puts maximum pressure on White's position while maintaining Black's structural advantages.\n\n```\ne5e4\n```"
