When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, queen, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on f5 is very active\n- White's queen on c6 is under attack by Black's pawn on h4\n- Black's knight on e4 is centralized and threatening\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6h6: Queen takes pawn, but allows Qxh6 and Black's queen becomes even more active\n- c6d5: Queen takes knight, but after Qxd5, Black's queen is still very active\n- c6c8: Retreating queen to safety while maintaining pressure\n- b1c3: Developing knight and attacking the e4 knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be b1c3:\n- Develops a piece\n- Attacks the dangerous e4 knight\n- If Black takes our queen with h4xc6, we can play Nxe4 winning material\n- If Black doesn't take, we maintain pressure on e4\n- Keeps our queen safe while improving our position\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or allow Black to maintain too much activity. b1c3 is the most active and improving move.\n\n```\nb1c3\n```"
