When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Black is down a queen for a rook, which is a significant material disadvantage.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on f5 is very active\n- Black's knight on g4 is threatening but can be easily kicked away\n- Black's queen on h1 is trapped and vulnerable\n- White's king is exposed on e2\n- Black's rook on d8 is blocked by its own pawn on b6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h1h5: Trying to save the queen but it's still trapped\n- g4f6: Removing the knight but allows White to play Qf5e5+\n- d8d5: Centralizing the rook but doesn't address the queen issue\n- h1g1: Moving the queen to safety while maintaining some activity\n\n4. Best move seems to be h1g1 because:\n- It saves the queen from immediate capture\n- The queen becomes more active on g1\n- It prevents any immediate checks from White's queen\n- It maintains some coordination between Black's pieces\n\nOther moves either don't address the queen's safety or allow White to maintain too much initiative. h1g1 is the most practical choice in this difficult position.\n\n```\nh1g1\n```"
