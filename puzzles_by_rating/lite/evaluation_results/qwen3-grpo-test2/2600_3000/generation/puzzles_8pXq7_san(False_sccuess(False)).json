When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and pawns vs White's knight and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is more active (b6) while White's king is stuck on d2\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on b4\n- Black's knight is very active on d6\n- White's knight on a5 is blocked by its own pawn on b4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d6e4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the b4 pawn\n- d6c4: Attacks the a3 pawn and controls important squares\n- b6a6: Moves the king towards the a-pawn\n- a4a3: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6e4 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- It attacks the b4 pawn which is White's main passed pawn\n- It prepares to support the a4 pawn's advance\n- It limits White's options as the knight can't move without losing material\n- After d6e4, if White defends b4 with Nc3, Black can play a4a3 creating a passed pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the key features of the position or are less active. For example, a4a3 immediately allows Nc3 attacking the pawn.\n\n```\nd6e4\n```"
