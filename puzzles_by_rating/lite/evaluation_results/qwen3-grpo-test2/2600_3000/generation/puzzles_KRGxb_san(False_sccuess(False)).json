When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, knight and pawns vs White's queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on d7\n- White's bishop on c2 is blocked by its own pawn on e3\n- Black's knight on c5 is well placed\n- White's king is exposed on f1\n- Black's king is relatively safe on g7\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g7g8: Moves king to corner, but doesn't accomplish much\n- g7f8: Moves king towards center but exposes it to checks\n- g7h7: Moves king to edge, not ideal\n- g7h6: Moves king forward but exposes it\n- d7d4: Centralizes queen and attacks e3 pawn\n- f7f6: Creates luft but weakens king position\n\n4. Best move is d7d4 because:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the e3 pawn which is pinned to the king\n- If White takes the queen (Qxd4), Black can play Nxe3 winning a pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with Qd3+ winning the bishop\n- Maintains all other options while improving the queen's position\n\n```\nd7d4\n```"
