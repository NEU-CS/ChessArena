When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and pawns vs White's bishop and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is more active (f7) while White's king is on d5\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on c3\n- Black's bishop is very active on g1, controlling key squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: King moves to corner, but seems passive\n- g1a7: Bishop takes the a4 pawn, but after Bxa4, White can play Kc4 attacking the bishop\n- g1d4: Centralizes the bishop and attacks the c3 pawn\n- a4a3: Advances the passed pawn, but White can play Kc4 stopping it\n\n4. Best move seems to be g1d4 because:\n- Centralizes the bishop\n- Attacks the c3 pawn which is White's most advanced passed pawn\n- If White takes the bishop (Kxd4), Black can play a4a3 creating a passed pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can maintain pressure\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to consolidate. g1d4 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\ng1d4\n```"
