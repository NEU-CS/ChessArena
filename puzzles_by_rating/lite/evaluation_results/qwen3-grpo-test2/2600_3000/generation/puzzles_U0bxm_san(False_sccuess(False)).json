When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but Black's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on h6\n- White's knight on d7 is under attack by Black's rook on e6\n- White's bishop on b2 is blocked by pawns\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning White's f3 pawn to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7f8: Moves the knight to safety but doesn't address the pin\n- d7f6: Attacks the queen but allows Qxf6\n- g1e3: Breaks the pin by moving the king\n- a1e1: Centralizes the rook and defends e3\n- b2a3: Moves the bishop out of the way\n\n4. Best move seems to be g1e3:\n- Breaks the dangerous pin immediately\n- After Qxe3, White can play Nf6 winning the queen\n- If Black doesn't take, White can defend e3 with Re1\n- Other moves either don't address the pin or allow Black to maintain pressure\n\nThe move g1e3 solves the most pressing problem (the pin) while maintaining material equality and initiative.\n\n```\ng1e3\n```"
