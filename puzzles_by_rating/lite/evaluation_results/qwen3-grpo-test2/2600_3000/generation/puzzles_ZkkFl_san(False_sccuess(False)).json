When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on b5 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on g5 that's advanced but blockaded by Black's f4 pawn\n- Black's rook on b1 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on f3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g2: Gets the king to safer square but away from action\n- d2d3: Centralizes the rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d2h2: Puts rook on open file but might be too passive\n- g5g6: Advances passed pawn but allows ...fxg6 opening files\n- a3a4: Stops ...b5-b4 but weakens b3 square\n\n4. Best move seems to be d2d3:\n- Centralizes the rook\n- Prepares to double on the d-file if needed\n- Covers the b3 square against Black's b5 pawn\n- Maintains flexibility to go to e3 or c3 later\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n\nOther moves either don't improve White's position or create new weaknesses. d2d3 is the most solid and flexible choice.\n\n```\nd2d3\n```"
