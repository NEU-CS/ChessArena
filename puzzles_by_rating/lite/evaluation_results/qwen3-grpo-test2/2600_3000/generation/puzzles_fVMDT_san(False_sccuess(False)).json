Black is down a minor piece but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's bishop on h5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on f4\n- White's king is exposed on c4\n- Black's rook on f7 is controlling the 7th rank\n- White's rook on a6 is tied to defending the a7 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h5g4: Bishop takes pawn, but White can play Kd3 attacking the bishop\n- h5f3: Bishop checks the king, but White can play Kd3\n- g3g2: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n- f4f3: Pushing the passed pawn, creating a dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be f4f3:\n- Creates an immediate passed pawn threat\n- White can't stop both the f-pawn and h-pawn\n- If White takes the pawn (Kd3), Black can play h5g4 winning a pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can push f3f2 next move\n\nThe move f4f3 creates the most problems for White while maintaining Black's active pieces. It's the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\nf4f3\n```"

Best move seems to be g3g5:\n- It pushes the passed pawn while maintaining the threat of g5-g4\n- White can't stop the pawn advance without sacrificing material\n- If White plays Nxd7, Black can play Bg4+ winning the rook\n- If White does nothing, the pawn will queen\n\nThe move g3g5 maintains maximum pressure and creates immediate threats that White must address.\n\n```\ng3g5\n```"
