When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on f5 is very active\n- Black's queen on a3 is awkwardly placed\n- Black's bishop on g7 is blocked by its own pawn on h6\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black has a knight on c2 that's very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c3c4: Centralizes the queen and attacks the d4 pawn\n- a3a4: Moves the queen to a more active square\n- c2e3: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n- g7e5: Opens the bishop's diagonal\n\n4. Best move seems to be c2e3:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks White's queen on f5\n- If White moves the queen, Black can play a3a4 increasing pressure\n- If White takes the knight (Qxe3), Black can play a3a4+ winning the rook on e8\n\nOther moves like c3c4 are good but don't create immediate threats. a3a4 is safe but doesn't improve Black's position as much. g7e5 is too slow.\n\n```\nc2e3\n```"
