Key features:\n- Black's king is on e6, White's king on e4\n- Black has a passed pawn on c6 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that's currently blocked by Black's king\n- Black's pawns on f6 and g6 are fixed and can't advance without being captured\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- e4f4: Moves king towards Black's pawns but away from the d-pawn\n- e4f3: Moves king towards Black's pawns but leaves d-pawn blocked\n- e4e3: Moves king backward, not helpful\n- e4d3: Moves king towards d-pawn to support its advance\n- g4f5: Captures Black's f-pawn, opening lines\n\n4. Best move is g4f5 because:\n- It captures a pawn, reducing Black's material\n- After Kxf5, White can advance the d-pawn with support from the king\n- It prevents Black from playing ...f5 in the future\n- It opens the g-file which might be useful for White's king to approach\n\nThe other moves either don't improve White's position or move the king away from the important d-pawn.\n\n```\ng4f5\n```"

Best move is e4d3 because:\n- It brings the king closer to the d-pawn which is White's most advanced pawn\n- Prepares to support d4-d5 push, creating a passed pawn\n- Maintains flexibility to go after black's pawns if needed\n- Keeps the king active in the center\n\nThe other moves either don't improve White's position or move the king away from key areas. e4d3 is the most purposeful move.\n\n```\ne4d3\n```"
