When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on d1\n- White's king is exposed on f3\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n- White has a passed pawn on g5\n- Black's rook on a8 is not active\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f3e4: Moves king towards center but exposes it more to checks\n- f3e3: Moves king towards safety but blocks the bishop on g5\n- f3g2: Moves king towards safety and protects the h2 pawn\n- f3f2: Moves king towards safety but blocks the queen's defense of h4\n\n4. Best move is f3g2 because:\n- Gets the king to relative safety\n- Protects the h2 pawn which is under attack from Black's queen\n- Maintains the bishop's control of g5\n- Doesn't block any pieces\n- Keeps options open for future movement\n\nThe other moves either expose the king more or block important pieces.\n\n```\nf3g2\n```"
