When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on g3 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on f1\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4\n- White has a passed pawn on a6\n- Black's rook on d2 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3h2: Queen check, but White can block with Qh1\n- g3g1: Queen takes rook, but White can play Qxg1\n- d2d1: Rook check, but White can play Kxd1\n- g3e5: Centralizing queen while attacking f4 pawn\n- d2d3: Pushing passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g3e5 because:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the f4 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If White takes the queen (Qxe5), Black can play d2d1+ winning the rook\n- If White doesn't take, Black can follow up with d2d1+ next move\n- Maintains all of Black's threats while improving the queen's position\n\n```\ng3e5\n```"
