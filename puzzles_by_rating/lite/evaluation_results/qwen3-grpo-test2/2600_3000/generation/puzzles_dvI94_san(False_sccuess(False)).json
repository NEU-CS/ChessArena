When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen and pawns vs White's queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's bishop on h6 is very active\n- Black's queen on e6 is under attack by White's queen on b5\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White has a passed pawn on a2 that could become dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6d7: Moves the queen to safety while maintaining control\n- e6f6: Blocks the bishop's diagonal but leaves queen exposed\n- e6c6: Moves queen away from attack but gives up control of important squares\n- f7f8: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be e6d7 because:\n- Gets the queen out of attack\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Keeps options open for future play\n- After Qd7, Black can consider activating the rook or pushing pawns\n\nOther moves either leave the queen exposed or don't address the immediate threat. e6d7 is the most solid choice.\n\n```\ne6d7\n```"
