When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, queen and pawns. White is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on e6\n- White's bishop on d4 is blocked by Black's pawn on b4\n- White has a passed pawn on g4\n- Black has a bishop on a4 controlling the long diagonal\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4g7: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Qxg7\n- d4a7: Bishop takes rook, but Black can play Qxa7\n- f2f8: Queen checks, but Black can block with Qxf8\n- g4g5: Advances passed pawn but doesn't create immediate threats\n- d2d3: Opens bishop's diagonal and prepares to push c3-c4\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4a7:\n- Wins the exchange (bishop for rook)\n- After Qxa7, White can play Qf7+ winning the queen\n- Even if Black doesn't take the bishop, White gains material\n- Other moves either don't win material or allow Black to maintain material advantage\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is to take the rook with the bishop.\n\n```\nd4a7\n```"
