When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on h6 that could be dangerous\n- Black's queen on f6 is very active\n- White's queen on e3 is protecting the h3 pawn\n- Black has a rook on c4 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f6h4: Attacks the h3 pawn, but White can defend with Qe3-h3\n- f6g5: Centralizes the queen and attacks the h5 pawn\n- c4c3: Advances the rook to attack the pawns\n- d7e6: Moves the bishop to a more active square\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6g5:\n- Centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the h5 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If White takes the queen (Qxg5), Black can play Rxc3 winning a pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can continue to pressure with moves like Qf4 or Qf6\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position as much or allow White to consolidate. f6g5 maintains maximum activity for Black's pieces.\n\n```\nf6g5\n```"
