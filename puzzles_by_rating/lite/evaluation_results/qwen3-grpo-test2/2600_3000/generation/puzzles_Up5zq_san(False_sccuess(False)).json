When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black has a knight on c4 that's very active\n- White's bishop on f4 is strong, controlling important squares\n- Black's queen on d8 is somewhat restricted\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d8e8: Centralizes the queen and connects rooks\n- e6f5: Attacks the strong bishop on f4\n- c4e3: Forks the bishop and pawn\n- d7e5: Captures the passed pawn\n\n4. Evaluating the best move:\n- e6f5 looks tempting as it attacks the bishop, but after Bg3 the bishop remains strong\n- c4e3 is very interesting as it wins the bishop after Bxe3 dxe3\n- d7e5 is solid, eliminating the passed pawn but allowing Bg3\n\nThe most forcing and best move is c4e3, as it creates a direct tactical opportunity. After:\n1... Nc4e3\n2. Bxe3 dxe3\nBlack wins a bishop for a knight, improving material balance while maintaining active pieces.\n\n```\nc4e3\n```"
