When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's king is more active (d4 vs Black's e6)\n- Black's pawns are mostly blocked (a7, b7)\n- White has passed pawns on c5 and d5\n- Black's h6 pawn is advanced but isolated\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6f7: Moves king towards white's pawns but away from own pawns\n- e6e7: Similar to f7, not improving position\n- e6d7: Moves king towards center and white's pawns\n- e6f6: Keeps king active but doesn't address passed pawns\n- b7b6: Releases the blockade on c5 pawn\n- a7a6: Doesn't accomplish much\n- h6h5: Advances isolated pawn\n- a7a5: Creates passed pawn but leaves b7 weak\n\n4. Best move seems to be b7b6:\n- Releases the blockade on c5 pawn\n- After b7b6, if white takes cxb6, Black can play a7a5 creating a passed pawn\n- If white doesn't take, Black can play a7a5 next move\n- This is the most active move, creating counterplay\n\n```\nb7b6\n```"
