When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on g4\n- White's king is exposed on e2\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n- White has a knight on g5 that's attacking the queen\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- e2d3: Moves king towards center but exposes it to checks\n- e2f2: Moves king towards safety but still leaves it exposed\n- e2d2: Moves king towards queenside but still exposed\n- e2f1: Moves king to corner, but may be dangerous\n- e2e1: Moves king to back rank, but still exposed\n- g5f3: Captures the queen with the knight\n\n4. Best move is g5f3:\n- It captures Black's powerful queen\n- After Qxf3, White can play Qxg4 winning the exchange (queen for rook)\n- This would leave White with bishop+knight vs rook, which is roughly equal\n- Other king moves don't address the immediate threat of the queen\n\nThe move g5f3 is the most forcing and best in the position, as it eliminates Black's most dangerous piece.\n\n```\ng5f3\n```"
