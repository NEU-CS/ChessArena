When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is on g8, White's king on d2\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's g5 pawn is threatening to advance\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d2e3: Centralizes king and prepares to stop c-pawn\n- d2c3: Directly blocks the c-pawn but leaves e-pawn unattended\n- g3g4: Stops black's g-pawn but weakens king position\n- h2h4: Prepares h-pawn advance but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- f2f4: Creates a passed pawn but may be premature\n\n4. Best move seems to be d2e3 because:\n- It centralizes the king\n- Prepares to stop the dangerous c-pawn (Ke3-d4-c5)\n- Maintains flexibility to support the e-pawn\n- Doesn't create any weaknesses\n- Keeps options open for both pawn advances\n\nOther moves either don't address the c-pawn threat or create weaknesses. d2e3 is the most active and flexible move.\n\n```\nd2e3\n```"
