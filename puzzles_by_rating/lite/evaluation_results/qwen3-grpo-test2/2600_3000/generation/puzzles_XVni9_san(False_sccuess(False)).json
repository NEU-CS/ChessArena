When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on f5 that's very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a rook on g4 eyeing the g-file\n- Black's queen on b6 is somewhat restricted by pawns\n- White's queen on e2 is controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Moves king to safety but seems passive\n- e8e7: Centralizes the rook and defends the king\n- b6d4: Queen moves to active square, attacking the knight\n- b6e3: Queen checks the king, but White can block with Qe3\n- e4d3: Pawn takes knight, but White can recapture with rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be b6d4:\n- Attacks the active knight on f5\n- If White takes the queen (Qxd4), Black can play Qxd4 and have a strong centralized queen\n- If White moves the knight, Black's queen becomes very active\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't allow any immediate threats from White\n\nOther moves either don't address the active knight or leave the king exposed. b6d4 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nb6d4\n```"
