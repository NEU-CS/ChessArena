When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's bishop is very active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is close to Black's pawns\n- Black's king is on e3, somewhat exposed\n- White's bishop controls important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6e8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- c6d7: Centralizes bishop but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- c6e4: Attacks the e4 pawn, but Black can defend\n- g5h6: King moves away from action\n- g5f6: King moves towards Black's pawns\n\n4. Best move seems to be g5f6 because:\n- It brings the king closer to Black's pawns\n- Prepares to capture the e4 pawn next move (Kf6e5)\n- Limits Black's king movement\n- Maintains control over key squares\n- Prevents Black from advancing the a-pawn without consequence\n\nThe move g5f6 improves White's position by centralizing the king and preparing to win material while maintaining control of the position.\n\n```\ng5f6\n```"
