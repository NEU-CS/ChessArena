When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's bishop on g7 is blocked by its own pawn on f5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f8e8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- e7h4: Attacks the queen but allows Qxh4\n- f5f7: Opens the f-file but allows Qxh4\n- c3b2: Advances the passed pawn but seems slow\n- e7g5: Centralizes the queen and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7g5:\n- Attacks White's queen immediately\n- If Qxh4, then Qxh4 and Black's queen becomes very active\n- If Q moves away, Black can play f5f7 next, opening the f-file\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Prevents any immediate threats from White\n\nOther moves either don't address the active White queen or are too passive. e7g5 is the most active and challenging response.\n\n```\ne7g5\n```"
