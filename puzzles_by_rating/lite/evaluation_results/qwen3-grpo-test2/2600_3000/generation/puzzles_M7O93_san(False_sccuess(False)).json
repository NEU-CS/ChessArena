When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is very active on f4\n- Black's king is on f6\n- White has a passed pawn on h6 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a passed pawn on c4\n- The pawn structure is locked in several places\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f6f7: Moves king away from center, not helpful\n- f6e7: Moves king towards center but away from action\n- f6g6: Moves king towards h6 pawn, but allows white to push h6-h7\n- f6e6: Keeps king central and flexible\n- b5b4: Pushes pawn but allows a3xb4\n- a5a4: Pushes pawn, creating a passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be a5a4:\n- Creates a passed pawn on a4\n- If white takes b5b4, black can play a4a3 creating a dangerous passed pawn\n- If white doesn't take, black can push a4-a3 later\n- Keeps king flexible to move to e6 or g6 as needed\n\nThe move a5a4 creates the most long-term threats while maintaining king flexibility.\n\n```\na5a4\n```"
