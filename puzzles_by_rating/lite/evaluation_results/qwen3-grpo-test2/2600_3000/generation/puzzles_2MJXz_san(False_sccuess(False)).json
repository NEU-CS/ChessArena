When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a bishop on e3 controlling important squares\n- White's queen on g5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on d8\n- White has a knight on h4 that could be dangerous\n- Black has a passed pawn on c2 that could promote\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g7: Bishop takes pawn, but allows Black to play ...Bxh4\n- g5g8: Queen checks, but Black can block with ...Kd7\n- h4g6: Knight moves to a strong square, attacking f8\n- c3d5: Knight centralizes and attacks the bishop on e3\n- a1e1: Rook lifts to defend against the c2 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be h4g6:\n- Attacks the f8 square, threatening to jump to f8 next move\n- If Black takes the knight with ...Bxg6, White can play Qxg6+ winning the bishop\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Nf8+ winning the rook\n- Maintains pressure while developing the knight to a strong square\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. h4g6 is the most forcing and dangerous move.\n\n```\nh4g6\n```"
