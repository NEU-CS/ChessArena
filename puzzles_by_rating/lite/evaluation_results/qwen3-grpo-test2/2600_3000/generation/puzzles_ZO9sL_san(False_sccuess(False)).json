When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on b6 that could be dangerous\n- White's rook on d7 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g5\n- White's knight on e3 is well placed\n- Black has a rook on d2 that's threatening White's king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d7d8: Rook lift, but doesn't address immediate threats\n- e3f5: Centralizing the knight, attacking the bishop\n- e3g4: Attacking the h2 pawn, but allows Black's rook to check\n- a6a7: Pushing the passed pawn, but it's not immediately threatening\n- h1h2: Defending against the rook check\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3f5:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the bishop on g6\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can play h1h2 defending against the rook check\n- If Black plays ...Bh5, White can play a6a7 pushing the passed pawn\n- Maintains control of key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the position's needs or allow Black counterplay. e3f5 is the most active and flexible move.\n\n```\ne3f5\n```"
