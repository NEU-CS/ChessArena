When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on f5 is very active\n- White's queen on h8 is trapped and needs to find a safe square\n- Black's king is exposed on e7\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black has a pawn on f4 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the queen out of danger but doesn't accomplish much\n- g2b7: Bishop takes pawn, but allows Black's queen to become more active\n- e5e6: Advances the passed pawn, but Black can play Qf5e6\n- a1b1: Prepares to double rooks but is slow\n\n4. Best move seems to be g2b7:\n- Wins a pawn immediately\n- After Bxb7, White can play Qh8g7+ forcing the king to move\n- Then White can follow up with Qg7h7+ winning more material\n- Black's queen can't defend both the bishop and the king simultaneously\n\nThe sequence would be:\n1. g2b7 Bxb7\n2. Qh8g7+ Kd6 (only move)\n3. Qg7h7+ Ke5\n4. Qh7g7 winning the bishop on b7\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng2b7\n```"
