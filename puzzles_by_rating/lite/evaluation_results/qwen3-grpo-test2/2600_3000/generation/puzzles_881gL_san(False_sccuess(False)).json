When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and bishop vs White's rook and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has passed pawns on b6 and c6\n- Black's bishop is very active on f4\n- Black's rook on c7 is controlling the c-file\n- White's king is exposed on g2\n- Black's king is relatively safe on f7\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: Moves king towards corner but doesn't accomplish much\n- f7f8: Similar to g8, passive\n- f7e8: Moves king away from center\n- f7g6: Gets king more active but exposes to checks\n- f7f6: Keeps king safe while maintaining control\n- f7e6: Centralizes king but may be risky\n- c7d7: Rook move that maintains control of c-file\n\n4. Best move seems to be c7d7 because:\n- Maintains control of the c-file\n- Prepares to double on the d-file if needed\n- Doesn't expose the king\n- Keeps all options open for the bishop\n- Prevents White from advancing the b-pawn (b6-b7) as Rd7 would control that square\n\nThe other moves either don't improve Black's position or could lead to complications. c7d7 is the most solid and active choice.\n\n```\nc7d7\n```"
