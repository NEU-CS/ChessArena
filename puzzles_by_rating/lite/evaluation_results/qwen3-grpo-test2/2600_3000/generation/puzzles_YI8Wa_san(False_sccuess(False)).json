When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is more active (f6) while White's king is on g2\n- Black has a passed pawn on e4 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on f4 that could be advanced\n- The h3 pawn is under attack by Black's h7 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g2h2: Moves king towards the h-pawn but doesn't address the e4 pawn\n- g2h1/g2g1/g2f1: Retreating king seems passive\n- f4f5: Advances the passed pawn but allows ...e3\n- h3h4: Pushes the pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n- g3g4: Creates a passed pawn but weakens the h3 pawn\n- f2f3: Blocks the e4 pawn's advance and protects h3\n\n4. Best move is f2f3 because:\n- It blocks the dangerous e4 pawn\n- Protects the h3 pawn from being captured\n- Maintains flexibility for the king\n- Doesn't create any new weaknesses\n- Keeps all options open for future play\n\nThe other moves either don't address the immediate threats or create new weaknesses.\n\n```\nf2f3\n```"
