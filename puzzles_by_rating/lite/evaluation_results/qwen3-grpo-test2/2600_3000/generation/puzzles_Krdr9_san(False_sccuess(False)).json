When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and knight vs Black's rook and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but Black's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on d3 that's threatening to promote\n- White's bishop on d5 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d5g8: Bishop takes the h7 pawn, but Black can play ...Rd8 defending\n- d5f7: Bishop checks the king, but Black can take the bishop with ...Kxf7\n- e2e8: Rook takes the rook, but Black can play ...Bxe8\n- b3c5: Knight moves to attack the d3 pawn\n- g3g4: Pushes the pawn to create luft for the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be b3c5:\n- Attacks the dangerous d3 pawn\n- If Black takes the knight with ...dxc5, White can play Bg8+ winning the h7 pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Nxd3 eliminating the passed pawn\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Keeps all pieces active\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or allow Black to consolidate. b3c5 is the most active and problematic move for Black.\n\n```\nb3c5\n```"
