When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's rook is very active on e4, attacking the h4 pawn\n- White's rook on h7 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's bishop on d1 is controlling the long diagonal\n- White's king is exposed on b4\n- Black has a passed pawn on f5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7h8: Promotes the rook but allows Black to play ...Rd4+ winning the h4 pawn\n- h7e7: Centralizes the rook but doesn't address the immediate threats\n- b4c5: Moves the king towards the center but leaves h4 pawn hanging\n- h4h5: Pushes the pawn but allows ...Rd4+ winning it\n- b4a5: Moves the king away from checks but doesn't solve problems\n\n4. Best move seems to be h7h6:\n- Protects the h4 pawn from the rook attack\n- Keeps the rook active\n- If Black takes h4 pawn with ...Rxh4, White can play Rh7+ winning the bishop\n- If Black doesn't take, White can consider Rh7+ next move\n\nAfter considering all options, h7h6 seems like the most solid move, protecting the pawn while maintaining piece activity.\n\n```\nh7h6\n```"
