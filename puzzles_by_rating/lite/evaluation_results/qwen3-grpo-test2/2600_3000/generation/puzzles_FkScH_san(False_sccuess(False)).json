When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and queen vs Black's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black has some compensation with the active rook and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on g3\n- White's queen is very active on g4\n- Black's rook on h1 is threatening to capture the f2 pawn\n- White's knight on g5 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h7: Captures the pawn but allows Black's rook to capture f2\n- g4c8: Checks the king but Black can block with ...b7\n- g4e6: Centralizes the queen and attacks the d5 pawn\n- g4h5: Protects f2 but doesn't address other issues\n- g5e4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the d5 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g5e4 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the d5 pawn which is supporting Black's passed pawns\n- If Black takes the knight with ...dxe4, White can play Qxg3 winning the passed pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Qe6 or Qd7 putting more pressure\n\nThis move maximizes White's activity while minimizing Black's counterplay. It's the most forcing and positionally sound move.\n\n```\ng5e4\n```"
