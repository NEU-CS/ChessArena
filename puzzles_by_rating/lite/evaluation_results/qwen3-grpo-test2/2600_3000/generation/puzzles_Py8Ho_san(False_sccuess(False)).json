When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a knight on g5 attacking f7\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's bishop on d5 is very active\n- White's pawn on e5 is passed and dangerous\n- Black's pawn on b6 is weak\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- a8e8: Centralizes the rook but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d5e4: Captures the pawn but allows Nf7+ winning the bishop\n- d5c4: Moves the bishop to a safe square while maintaining pressure\n- d7e5: Captures the dangerous passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d7e5:\n- Eliminates the dangerous passed pawn\n- If Nf7+ after d5e4, we can play Kf8 and the bishop is safe\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Opens the d-file for the rook\n\nOther moves either don't address the passed pawn or allow White to maintain pressure. d7e5 is the most principled move, removing White's best asset while maintaining Black's active pieces.\n\n```\nd7e5\n```"
