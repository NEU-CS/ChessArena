When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on d8 is eyeing the a7 rook\n- Black's bishop on g4 is very active\n- White's knight on e4 is centralized but could be kicked\n- White's rook on a7 is under attack by the queen\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a7a8: Moves the rook to safety but seems passive\n- e4f6: Attacks the bishop on g4 but allows Qxa7\n- d2h6: Attacks the bishop but allows Qxa7\n- e4d6: Blocks the queen's attack on a7 while developing the knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4d6 because:\n- It blocks the queen's attack on the a7 rook\n- The knight on d6 is very strong, controlling key squares\n- It maintains material equality\n- It doesn't allow any immediate tactics for Black\n- It keeps options open for White's pieces\n\nOther moves either allow Qxa7 or don't address the immediate threat to the rook.\n\n```\ne4d6\n```"
