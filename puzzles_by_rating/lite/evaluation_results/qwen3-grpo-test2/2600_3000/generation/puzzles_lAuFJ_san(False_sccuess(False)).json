When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's king is still in the center\n- White's bishop on c4 is very active\n- Black's queen on c6 is under attack by the bishop\n- Black's knight on g5 is well placed but could be kicked by f3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6d7: Moves the queen to safety while maintaining pressure on e5\n- c6e4: Centralizes the queen and attacks the bishop\n- g5e4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the bishop\n- f8b4: Pins the knight on d2 to the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6e4:\n- Gets the queen to a more active central square\n- Attacks the strong bishop on c4\n- If White moves the bishop, Black can play ...Nxe4 winning a pawn\n- Maintains pressure on the e5 pawn\n- Keeps options open for ...Nxe4 or ...Qd5+\n\nOther moves either don't address the active bishop or don't centralize the queen as effectively. c6e4 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nc6e4\n```"
