When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (king + pawns). Black has pawns on a6, f4, g6, h7. White has pawns on c5, d5, d4, g2, h2.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's f4 pawn is advanced and dangerous\n- White's king is more active (d4 vs black's e7)\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's king is slightly more exposed\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d4e5: Centralizes king but allows f3, pushing black's dangerous pawn\n- d4e4: Keeps king active but doesn't address f4 pawn\n- d4c4: Moves away from action\n- d4c3: Similar to c4\n- d5d6: Advances passed pawn but allows f3\n- c5c6: Creates another passed pawn but slow\n- h2h3/g2g3: Prepares to stop f4 pawn but slow\n- h2h4/g2g4: More aggressive, preparing to create counterplay\n\n4. Best move is h2h4:\n- Directly challenges black's advanced f4 pawn\n- If black takes (g6xh4), white can play g2g4, opening the g-file for the king\n- If black doesn't take, white can play h4h5, creating a passed pawn\n- Maintains all other options while being the most active\n\n```\nh2h4\n```"
