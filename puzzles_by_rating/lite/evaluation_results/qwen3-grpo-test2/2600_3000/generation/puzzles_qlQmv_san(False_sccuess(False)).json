When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Q, B, P, P, P, K\n- Black has: Q, R, P, P, K\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop vs rook)\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on f4\n- Black's queen is on d1, but not very active\n- Black's king is exposed on h6\n- White has a passed pawn on a3 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- h6h7: Moves king away from potential checks but doesn't address any threats\n- h6g6: Moves king towards center but still exposed\n- h6h5: Moves king forward but into potential danger\n- g7g5: Creates luft for king but weakens pawn structure\n\n4. Threats:\n- White could play Qf4-e3+ next move, forcing black king to move\n- White could push a3-a4 at some point\n\nThe best move is g7g5 because:\n1) It creates an escape square for the king (h5)\n2) It prevents Qe3+ by breaking the diagonal\n3) It's the most flexible move, maintaining options for the king\n4) It doesn't create any new weaknesses like h6h5 would\n\n```\ng7g5\n```"
