When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is on e6, White's king on d3\n- Black's pawns are more advanced but potentially isolated\n- White has a passed pawn on c4 that could be dangerous\n- Black's g5 pawn is under attack by White's g4 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d3e4: Centralizes king but allows Black to play ...c4 capturing White's pawn\n- d3e3: Keeps king more active but doesn't address immediate threats\n- d3c3: Protects b3 pawn but seems passive\n- d3e2/d3d2/d3c2: Retreating king seems too passive\n- b3b4: Advances pawn but allows ...a4 capturing it\n\n4. Best move is d3e4 because:\n- It centralizes the king towards both flanks\n- After ...c4, White can play b3b4 winning a pawn\n- It prepares to support the c4 pawn's advance\n- It maintains flexibility to go after Black's g5 pawn later\n\nThe move d3e4 is the most active and maintains White's advantages in the position.\n\n```\nd3e4\n```"
