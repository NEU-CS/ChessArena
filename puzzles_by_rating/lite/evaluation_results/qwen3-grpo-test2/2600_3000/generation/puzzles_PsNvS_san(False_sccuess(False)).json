When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Pawn\n- Black has: Rook, Bishop, Queen, Pawn\nBlack is up a bishop but white has some compensation with the active queen and rook.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f5\n- White's queen on h5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5\n- White's king is on c3, relatively safe\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- f5e6: Moves the king towards the center but into potential checks from the white queen. After Qh5e5+, Black would have to move the king again, losing time.\n- f5e4: Moves the king towards the center but away from the queen's diagonal. This seems safer as it doesn't walk into immediate checks.\n\n4. Long-term considerations:\n- Black's a-pawn is dangerous but needs support\n- White's pieces are very active and need to be contained\n- Black should try to activate his rook and bishop\n\nThe safer move is f5e4 as it avoids immediate checks and keeps more options open. f5e6 would be too risky as it walks into the queen's diagonal.\n\n```\nf5e4\n```"
