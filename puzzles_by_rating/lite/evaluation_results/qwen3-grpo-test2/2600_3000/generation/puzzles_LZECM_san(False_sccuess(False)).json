When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook and pawns vs White's rook and pawns. Material is equal, but Black's rook is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on a5 is very active\n- White's king is exposed on e4\n- Black's king is somewhat exposed on e7\n- White has a passed pawn on b6 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a5a4: Attacks the g4 pawn and prepares to double on the g-file\n- a5e5: Centralizes the rook and attacks the e4 king\n- e7f7: Moves the king to a safer square\n- c6c5: Advances the pawn to create threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be a5e5 because:\n- It centralizes the rook\n- It directly attacks the white king\n- It cuts off the white king's escape squares\n- It prepares to double rooks if needed\n- It maintains pressure on the e-file\n\nOther moves either don't improve the position as much or allow White to consolidate. The rook move is most active and puts immediate pressure on White.\n\n```\na5e5\n```"
