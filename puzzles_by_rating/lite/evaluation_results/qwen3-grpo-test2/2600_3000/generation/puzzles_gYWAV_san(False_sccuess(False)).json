When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on d4 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- Black's rook on e7 is under attack by White's rook on d8\n- Black's bishop on c6 is blocked by its own pawn on b5\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7e8: Moves the rook out of attack but leaves king exposed\n- e7f7: Moves rook to defend king but still leaves it exposed\n- b7c7: Moves queen to defend rook but blocks bishop\n- c6d5: Moves bishop to active square, attacking white queen\n- e4e3: Advances pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6d5 because:\n- It attacks White's active queen\n- If White takes the bishop (Qxd5), Black can play Qb6+ winning the rook on d8\n- If White moves queen, Black can play Qb6+ anyway\n- It opens the diagonal for Black's queen\n- It maintains defense of the rook on e7\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or don't improve Black's position as much.\n\n```\nc6d5\n```"
