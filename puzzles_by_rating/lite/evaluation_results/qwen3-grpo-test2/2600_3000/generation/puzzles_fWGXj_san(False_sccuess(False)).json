When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, knight and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on h7 is very active\n- Black's rook on c2 is attacking the g2 pawn\n- Black's bishop on f6 is blocked by its own pawn on e6\n- White has a knight on g5 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c2g2: Captures the pawn but allows Qxg2 winning the rook\n- c2c1: Retreats the rook but seems passive\n- f6g5: Captures the knight but allows Qxh6\n- e6e5: Opens the bishop's diagonal but weakens d5\n- b5b4: Advances the passed pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be c2g2:\n- It wins a pawn immediately\n- After Qxg2, Black can play Bxg5 winning the knight\n- White can't take the rook because it's protected by the bishop\n- Even if White doesn't take, Black has active pieces\n\nThe sequence would be:\n1... c2g2\n2. Qxg2 Bxg5\nAnd Black is up a piece for a pawn.\n\n```\nc2g2\n```"
