When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on d3\n- White's king is exposed on e2\n- Black's queen on h1 is very active\n- White has a rook on a5 and queen on d1\n- Black has a bishop on e5 controlling important squares\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- e2e3: Moves the king towards the center but exposes it more to checks from the black queen\n- e2d2: Moves the king towards the queenside but still leaves it exposed\n- d1d3: Captures the dangerous passed pawn while attacking the bishop on e5\n\n4. d1d3 seems best because:\n- It eliminates the dangerous passed pawn\n- It attacks the bishop on e5\n- After Qxe5, White can play Ra5d5+ winning the knight on e6\n- It's the most active move that improves White's position\n\nThe other king moves leave the king exposed to checks and don't address the immediate threat of the passed pawn.\n\n```\nd1d3\n```"
