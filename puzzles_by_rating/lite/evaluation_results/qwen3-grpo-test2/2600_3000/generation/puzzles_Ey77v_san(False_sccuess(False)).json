When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on c3 that's threatening to promote\n- White's rook on h4 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's knight on g4 is threatening to capture the h3 bishop\n- White's king is exposed on c1\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h4h8: Rook retreat, but allows Black to push c2\n- f4d6: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play c2\n- a4a5: Rook moves to defend against c2 push\n- g1g4: Queen takes knight, but Black can play c2\n- h3g4: Bishop takes knight, but Black can play c2\n\n4. Best move seems to be h3g4:\n- Eliminates the threatening knight\n- After c2, White can play a4a5 to stop the pawn\n- If Black plays c2 anyway, White can play a4c4 to capture the pawn\n- Maintains material equality while removing a key attacker\n\nOther moves either allow the c-pawn to promote or lose material. h3g4 is the most forcing and eliminates Black's biggest threat.\n\n```\nh3g4\n```"
