When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Black is up a knight but White has some compensation with the active rook on e6.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on e6 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g7\n- White has a passed pawn on c6\n- Black's knight on h6 is awkwardly placed\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h6g4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the f2 pawn\n- f6e5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the e6 rook\n- c7e5: Bishop move that attacks the e6 rook\n- d8d7: Moves the queen to defend the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6e5:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the active e6 rook\n- If White takes the knight (Rxe5), Black can play Qd7+ winning the f2 pawn\n- If White moves the rook, Black can play Nf4 attacking the queen\n- It's more active than h6g4 which doesn't accomplish as much\n- It's better than c7e5 which allows Rxe5\n\nThe move f6e5 improves Black's piece activity while maintaining material advantage and putting pressure on White's position.\n\n```\nf6e5\n```"
