When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's bishop is more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a passed pawn on b4 that could be dangerous\n- White's king is exposed on g5\n- Black's king is on c7\n- White's bishop on b5 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h6: Moves king away from center but doesn't address threats\n- g5f6: Centralizes king but exposes it to checks\n- b5c6: Captures the knight, but after ...b3 White's king gets cut off\n- b5a6: Moves bishop to safety but doesn't address threats\n- b5c4: Attacks the b4 pawn while maintaining control\n\n4. Best move seems to be b5c4 because:\n- It attacks the dangerous b4 pawn\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- If Black takes the bishop (...bxc3), White can play Kf4 attacking the f6 pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Kf4 or b3 to stop the pawn\n\nOther moves either don't address the b4 pawn or leave the king too exposed. b5c4 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nb5c4\n```"
