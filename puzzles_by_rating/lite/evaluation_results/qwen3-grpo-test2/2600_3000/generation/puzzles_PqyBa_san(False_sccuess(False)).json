When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: 1 pawn, 1 rook, 1 knight, 1 king\n- Black has: 1 pawn, 1 rook, 1 knight, 1 king\nMaterial is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on a7 that could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's a7 pawn is very advanced and threatening to promote\n- Black's king is exposed and White's knight on e4 is very active\n- Black's rook on b2 is attacking White's king\n- Black's knight on g1 is trapped and will be lost\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- e5d5: Moves king towards center but away from a7 pawn\n- e5f4: Moves king towards White's pieces but away from a7 pawn\n- e5d4: Moves king towards a7 pawn while also attacking White's knight\n\n4. Best move is e5d4 because:\n- It moves the king towards the a7 pawn which is White's main threat\n- It attacks the knight on e4, forcing White to move it or lose it\n- It keeps the king more active and centralized\n- After Kd4, if White moves the knight, Black can capture the a7 pawn\n- If White doesn't move the knight, Black can take it next move\n\nThe other moves don't address the a7 pawn threat as effectively.\n\n```\ne5d4\n```"
