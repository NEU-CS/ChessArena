Evaluating the legal moves:\n- e3f3: Moves king towards center but doesn't address any threats\n- e3d3: Moves king towards black pawn on d5, but allows ...d4 winning a pawn\n- e3e2: Moves king back, but seems safest\n\n4. Best move is e3e2 because:\n- It keeps the king safe from any potential checks\n- It maintains control over f3 square\n- It doesn't allow black to win a pawn with ...d4\n- It keeps options open to move towards either side of the board\n- The king is already well placed on e3, and moving back is preferable to committing to a direction\n\nThe other moves either expose the king or allow black to gain material advantage.\n\n```\ne3e2\n```"

Best move seems to be b7d6:\n- It directly attacks the black king, forcing it to move\n- After Kc6-d7 (only legal move), White can play a6b5, cutting off more squares\n- This maintains pressure while keeping the initiative\n- Other moves either don't address the king or allow Black to push pawns\n\nThe most forcing and active move is b7d6, putting immediate pressure on Black's king.\n\n```\nb7d6\n```"
