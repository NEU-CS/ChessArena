When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is more active (g4) while White's king is on e4\n- Black has a passed h-pawn (h5) that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed f-pawn (f2) that could also be dangerous\n- Black's bishop is on g1, controlling the long diagonal\n- White's bishop is on e1, controlling the short diagonal\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g4g5: Advances king but doesn't accomplish much\n- g4h4: Moves king towards the h-pawn but exposes it to checks\n- g4h3: Moves king towards the f-pawn but away from the h-pawn\n- g1h2: Moves bishop to control f4 square and prevent f-pawn advance\n- g1f2: Captures the dangerous f2 pawn\n- b7b6/b7b5: Pawn moves that don't address immediate concerns\n- h5h4: Advances the passed h-pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be g1f2:\n- It captures the dangerous passed f-pawn\n- After Bxf2, Black can play h5h4 to advance the passed pawn\n- White's king is too far to stop both the h-pawn and potential b-pawn advance\n- It's the most active move that improves Black's position\n\n```\ng1f2\n```"
