When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- White's king is exposed on g3\n- Black's rook on f4 is very active\n- Black's king is on g7, which is somewhat exposed\n- White has a passed pawn on a2 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f4f3: Attacks the king directly, but White can play Kxf3\n- f4g4: Checks the king, but White can play Kh3\n- f4h4: Prepares to double on the h-file, but doesn't seem urgent\n- g7h6: Moves the king to safety\n- e4e3: Advances the pawn, but allows White to play Rxa6\n\n4. Best move seems to be f4f3:\n- It's a direct attack on the king\n- If White takes the rook (Kxf3), Black can play g7f6+ winning the h4 pawn\n- If White moves the king, Black can play f3f2 threatening to promote\n- It maintains Black's active rook position\n\nThe most forcing and dangerous move is f4f3, putting immediate pressure on White's position.\n\n```\nf4f3\n```"
