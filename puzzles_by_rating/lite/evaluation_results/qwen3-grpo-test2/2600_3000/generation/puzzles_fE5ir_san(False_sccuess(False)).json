When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's queen and bishop. Material is roughly equal, but Black's queen is very active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's knight on h7 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's queen on c7 is eyeing the h2 pawn\n- White's king is exposed on d1\n- Black's bishop on e5 is very strong\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h7f8: Saves the knight but allows Qxh2\n- e4f6: Centralizes the knight and attacks the bishop\n- d3a6: Bishop move that threatens to win the knight on c6\n- c2a4: Prepares to defend h2 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4f6 because:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the strong bishop on e5\n- If Black takes the knight (Bxf6), White can play Qd2 defending h2\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can play Nf7+ winning the pawn on g6\n- It maintains material balance while improving piece activity\n\nOther moves either don't address the threats or miss opportunities to improve White's position.\n\n```\ne4f6\n```"
