When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's bishop and knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's knight on g5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's bishop on d6 is blocked by its own pawn on d5\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black's pawn on a6 is weak\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h7: Knight check, but Black can block with f8h7\n- g5f7: Knight check, but Black can take with king\n- e2e6: Bishop move attacking f7 pawn\n- d2e4: Centralizing the queen and attacking d5 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2e6:\n- Attacks the f7 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If Black takes the bishop (d6e6), White can play Qd2xe3 winning a pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can follow up with Qd2xe3 anyway\n- Maintains pressure while developing the bishop to its most active square\n\nOther moves either don't create threats or allow Black to consolidate. e2e6 is the most forcing move that creates immediate problems for Black.\n\n```\ne2e6\n```"
