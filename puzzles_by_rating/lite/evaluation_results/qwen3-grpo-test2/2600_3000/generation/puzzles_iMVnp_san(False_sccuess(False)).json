When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's bishop on g5 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- Black's rook on c8 is blocked by pawns\n- White has a passed pawn on d4\n- Black's knight on d6 is under pressure from White's bishop\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Gets the rook out of potential bishop attacks but doesn't solve king safety\n- f8g8: Moves king to safety but blocks the rook\n- d6e8: Moves the knight to safety but gives up control of important squares\n- c6e5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the bishop\n- c6d4: Captures the passed pawn but allows Bf6+\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6e5:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the active bishop on g5\n- If White takes the knight (Bxe5), Black can play f7f5 attacking the bishop\n- If White moves the bishop, Black gains time to improve position\n- It maintains control of key squares around the king\n\nOther moves either don't address the bishop's activity or leave the king unsafe. c6e5 is the most active and challenging response.\n\n```\nc6e5\n```"
