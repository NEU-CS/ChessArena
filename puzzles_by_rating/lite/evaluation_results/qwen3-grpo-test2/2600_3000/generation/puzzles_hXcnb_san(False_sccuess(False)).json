When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, bishop and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active bishop and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on d6 is very active\n- Black's bishop on e4 is strong, controlling important squares\n- Black's queen on h7 is somewhat exposed\n- White has a passed pawn on b6 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4g6: Bishop takes pawn, but allows Qxg6\n- e4c6: Bishop takes queen! This seems very tempting\n- h7h6: Moves queen to safety but doesn't address the threat\n- f6f5: Advances pawn but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. The most forcing and best move is e4c6, capturing the queen:\n- After Bxc6, White can't recapture (Qxc6 allows Qxh2+ winning material)\n- Black maintains the bishop pair and active pieces\n- Black's passed pawns become more dangerous\n- White's b-pawn is still a threat but Black can handle it\n\nAll other moves either don't address the queen or allow White to maintain the strong queen. e4c6 is the most precise and winning move.\n\n```\ne4c6\n```"
