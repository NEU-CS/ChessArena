When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's rook on b6 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- Black's bishop on e5 is blocking the queen's diagonal\n- White's queen on a5 has potential to deliver checks\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- b6b8: Rook check, but Black can block with queen\n- a5a8: Queen check, but Black can capture with rook\n- b1e4: Bishop move attacking the bishop on e5\n- a5e1: Queen move threatening to check on g3\n\n4. Best move seems to be b1e4:\n- It attacks the bishop on e5 which is defending Black's king\n- If Black takes the bishop (dxe4), White can play Qa8+ winning the rook on c7\n- If Black moves the bishop, White can play Qa8+ winning the rook\n- It maintains all of White's threats while improving the bishop's position\n\nOther moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate. b1e4 is the most forcing move that creates complications in Black's position.\n\n```\nb1e4\n```"
