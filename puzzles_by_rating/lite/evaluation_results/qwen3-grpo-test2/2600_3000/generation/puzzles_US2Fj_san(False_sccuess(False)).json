When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is more active (f5) while White's king is stuck on f2\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n- White has a passed pawn on b4\n- Black's rook is very active on d4\n- White's rook on a3 is tied to defending the b4 pawn\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4h4: Attacks the g3 pawn, but White can defend with Rg3\n- d4g4: Centralizes the rook and attacks the g3 pawn\n- d4e4: Blocks the e6 pawn's advance\n- e6e5: Advances the passed pawn\n- f5g4: Centralizes the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4g4 because:\n- It centralizes the rook\n- It attacks the g3 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If White plays Rg3, Black can play f5g4 winning the pawn\n- It maintains pressure while keeping all options open\n- It's more active than e6e5 which would allow White to defend\n\nThe move d4g4 puts maximum pressure on White's position while maintaining flexibility.\n\n```\nd4g4\n```"
