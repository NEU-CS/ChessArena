When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, knight and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active queen and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d6\n- Black's queen on a5 is eyeing the weak white king position\n- Black has a passed pawn on a4 that could be dangerous\n- White's knight on d7 is blocking Black's rook on e8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a5d2: Queen checks the king, but White can just take the queen\n- a5e1: Queen checks the king, but White can block with rook\n- a5b4: Attacks the b3 pawn, but doesn't create threats\n- a8a7: Moves the rook to defend the a4 pawn\n- e8e7: Moves the rook to attack the knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be a5d2:\n- It's a forcing check that disrupts White's coordination\n- After Kbd1, Black can play Qxd2 winning the knight\n- Even if White finds a better defense, Black maintains active play\n- It's the most direct way to capitalize on Black's active queen\n\nThe move a5d2 creates immediate threats and forces White to react, which is ideal in this position where Black needs to be active.\n\n```\na5d2\n```"
