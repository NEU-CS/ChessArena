When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

White has pawns on a4, b3, c2, e5, g3, h3.\n\n2. King positions: Black king is on e6, White king is on e4. Both kings are active and central.\n\n3. Key features:\n   - Black has a passed pawn on d4\n   - White has a passed pawn on e5\n   - Black's g5 pawn is threatening to advance\n   - White's h3 pawn is vulnerable\n\n4. Candidate moves analysis:\n   - e6e7: Moves king away from center, not helpful\n   - e6d7: Moves king towards queenside, but away from action\n   - f7f6: Weakens king safety by opening g-file\n   - b6b5: Advances queenside pawn, but doesn't create threats\n   - a6a5: Similar to b6b5\n   - c5c4: Advances central pawn, but allows White to capture\n   - d4d3: Advances passed pawn, but White can capture with e5d3\n   - f7f5: Most active, creates passed pawn and opens g-file for king\n\nThe best move is f7f5, creating a passed pawn and opening the g-file for the king. This puts immediate pressure on White and creates counterplay. The passed f-pawn is dangerous and White will have to deal with it.\n\n```\nf7f5\n```"
