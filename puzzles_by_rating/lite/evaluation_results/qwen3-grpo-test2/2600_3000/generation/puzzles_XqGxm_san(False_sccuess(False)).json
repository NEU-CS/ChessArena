When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, bishop, pawns vs White's queen, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on g6 is very active\n- Black's queen on e7 is under attack by the bishop on f7\n- Black's knight on e3 is pinned to the king by White's rook on f2\n- Black's a1 rook is not very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e7f8: Moves queen to safety but allows White to play Qxg7\n- e7e8: Moves queen to safety but blocks the bishop\n- e3f5: Unpins the knight and attacks the queen\n- a1a2: Prepares to activate the rook\n\n4. Best move seems to be e3f5 because:\n- It unpins the knight from the king\n- It attacks White's very active queen\n- If White takes the knight (Qxf5), Black can play Qxf7 winning the bishop\n- If White moves the queen, Black can play Qxf7 winning material\n- It maintains control of key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the pin or allow White to maintain pressure. e3f5 is the most active and disruptive move.\n\n```\ne3f5\n```"
