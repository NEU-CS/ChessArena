When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and pawns vs Black's knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but White's bishop is more active.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on e5\n- White's bishop on f5 is very active\n- Black's knight on f6 is defending the king\n- White has a passed pawn on c4 that could be dangerous\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5c8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- f5h7: Bishop checks, but Black can just take the bishop\n- f5d7: Bishop checks, but Black can block with knight\n- f5g6: Bishop checks, but Black can take the bishop\n- f5e6: Bishop checks, but Black can take the bishop\n- f5e4: Bishop checks, but Black can take the bishop\n- f5d3: Bishop checks, but Black can take the bishop\n- f5c2: Bishop checks, but Black can take the bishop\n- f5b1: Bishop checks, but Black can take the bishop\n- a4b5: Pushes passed pawn, but allows Black to defend\n- a4a5: Doesn't accomplish much\n- a4b3: Creates a passed pawn but is slow\n- a4a3: Doesn't accomplish much\n\n4. Best move is f5e4+:\n- It's a check that forces Black's king to move\n- After Kd6 (only legal move), White can play Bf3+ winning the knight\n- Even if Black tries Kf5, White can play Bf3+ winning the knight\n- This leads to a winning material advantage\n\n```\nf5e4\n```"
