When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and queen vs Black's queen and knight. Material is roughly equal, but White has a passed pawn on d4 which could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f8\n- White's bishop on c6 is very active\n- Black's knight on f4 is threatening White's pawn on g2\n- White's queen on b3 is eyeing the black king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6e8: Bishop checks the king, but Black can block with queen\n- b3e6: Queen moves to attack the king and defend g2\n- b3d5: Queen centralizes and attacks the knight\n- g1h2: Moves king away from potential checks\n\n4. Best move seems to be b3e6 because:\n- It attacks the black king directly\n- Defends the g2 pawn from the knight\n- If Black takes the bishop with queen (Qxe6), White can play Qxg6 winning a pawn\n- If Black moves king, White can play Qxg6 winning a pawn\n- It maintains all of White's threats while defending key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the knight threat or don't maximize White's active pieces. The move b3e6 is the most forcing and maintains White's initiative.\n\n```\nb3e6\n```"
