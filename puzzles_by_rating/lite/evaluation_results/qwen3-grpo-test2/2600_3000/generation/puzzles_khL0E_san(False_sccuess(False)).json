When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook and pawns vs Black's bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black's bishop is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on b4 that could be dangerous\n- White's rook is active on b5\n- Black's king is exposed on c6\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on f5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f5g6: Moves king towards center but away from action\n- f5e6: Centralizes king but exposes to checks\n- b5b6: Attacks the pawn but allows ...b3\n- b5e5: Centralizes rook but doesn't address b4 pawn\n- a4a5: Stops ...b3 but doesn't address king safety\n- h2h4: Prepares g4 but is slow\n\n4. Best move seems to be b5b6:\n- Directly attacks the dangerous b4 pawn\n- If Black takes (cxb6), White can play a4a5 winning the pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play a4a5 next move\n- Maintains rook activity while addressing the most pressing concern\n\nThe move b5b6 solves the most immediate problem (the passed pawn) while maintaining piece activity.\n\n```\nb5b6\n```"
