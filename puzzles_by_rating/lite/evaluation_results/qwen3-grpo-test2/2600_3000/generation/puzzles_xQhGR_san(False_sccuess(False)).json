When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen and pawns vs Black's queen and pawns. Material is equal, but White has a passed pawn on d4 which could be dangerous.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen is very active on c4\n- Black has a pawn on a3 that could promote if not stopped\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could advance\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c4c8: Queen checks the king, but Black can just move the king\n- c4e6: Centralizes queen and attacks f7 pawn\n- d4d5: Advances the passed pawn\n- c4a4: Stops the a3 pawn from promoting\n\n4. Best move seems to be c4a4 because:\n- It stops Black's a3 pawn from promoting immediately\n- If Black takes the queen (Qxa4), White can play d4d5 creating a passed pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White can maintain pressure\n- Other moves either don't address the a3 pawn or don't maximize queen activity\n\nThe a3 pawn is the most urgent threat, so stopping it should be the priority.\n\n```\nc4a4\n```"
