When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has 3 pawns vs Black's 4 pawns. Black has a slight material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: Both kings are exposed, but Black's king is more centralized. White's king is on e3, Black's on e5.\n\n3. Pawn structure:\n   - White has passed pawns on a3 and h4\n   - Black has pawns on a5, b7, c6, g6, h6\n   - White's g4 pawn is under attack by Black's h6 pawn\n\n4. Candidate moves to consider:\n   - e3f3: Moves king towards center but doesn't address immediate threats\n   - e3d3: Moves king towards queenside but away from action\n   - e3f2: Moves king towards h-pawn but seems passive\n   - e3e2: Moves king backwards, not helpful\n   - e3d2: Moves king towards a-pawn but away from center\n   - h4h5: Advances passed pawn but allows g6xh5\n   - g4g5: Pushes pawn but allows h6xg5\n   - c3c4: Creates passed pawn but allows b7xc4\n   - a3a4: Advances passed pawn but allows b7xa6\n   - b2b3: Prepares c3-c4 but slow\n   - b2b4: More aggressive but creates weaknesses\n\nThe best move is h4h5, advancing the passed pawn. Even though it allows g6xh5, this opens the h-file for White's king to potentially attack Black's pawns. The passed h-pawn is very dangerous and Black will have to spend time dealing with it.\n\n```\nh4h5\n```"
