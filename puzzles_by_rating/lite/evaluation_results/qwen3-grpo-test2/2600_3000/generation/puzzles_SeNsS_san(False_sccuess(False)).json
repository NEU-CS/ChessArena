When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop and pawns vs White's queen, rook and pawns. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active rook and passed pawns.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is exposed on e4\n- Black's rook on a3 is very active\n- Black's queen on g2 is threatening\n- White's queen on d5 is very active\n- Black has a passed pawn on h5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a3a4: Attacks the d4 pawn and threatens to win material\n- g2g4: Checks the king and forces it to move\n- h5g4: Captures the g4 pawn with the h-pawn\n- a3f3: Checks the king and attacks the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be a3a4:\n- It attacks the d4 pawn which is unprotected\n- If White takes the rook (Qxa4), Black can play Qg4+ winning the g4 pawn\n- If White doesn't take, Black can continue to harass White's position\n- It maintains all of Black's threats while gaining material\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow White to consolidate. a3a4 is the most forcing and wins material.\n\n```\na3a4\n```"
