When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a knight and bishop vs White's queen and bishop. Black is down material but has some compensation with the active knight on d4.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen on e5 is very active\n- Black's knight on d4 is centralized and threatening\n- White has a bishop on c4 pointing at Black's kingside\n- Black's king is exposed after castling\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- d4e6: Centralizing the knight and attacking the queen\n- d4f5: Attacking the queen from another angle\n- d8e7: Developing the queen and connecting rooks\n- c8e6: Developing the bishop and attacking the queen\n\n4. Best move seems to be d4e6:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the queen which has no good retreat\n- If queen moves, Black can play c8e6 developing the bishop\n- If queen takes knight (Qxe6), Black can play d8e7 developing the queen with tempo\n\nOther moves either don't attack the queen or don't improve Black's position as much. d4e6 is the most forcing move in the position.\n\n```\nd4e6\n```"
