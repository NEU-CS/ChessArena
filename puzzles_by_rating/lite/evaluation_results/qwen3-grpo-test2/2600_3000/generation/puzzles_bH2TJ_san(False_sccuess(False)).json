When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on e3 is very active\n- White's queen on g7 is also active but potentially trapped\n- Black's king is exposed on b6\n- White has a bishop on c2 controlling important squares\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g7h8: Queen escape but allows Black to play Qe3xh6\n- g7f7: Keeps queen active and defends h5 pawn\n- c2h7: Bishop move attacking the rook on g8\n- f1f7: Rook move attacking the queen on e3\n\n4. Best move seems to be c2h7:\n- Attacks the rook on g8\n- If Black takes bishop (Rxh7), then Qg7xg8 wins the rook\n- If Black moves rook, we can play Qg7xg8 winning material\n- If Black plays Qe3xh6, we have Bxh7 winning the rook\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow Black to maintain the initiative. c2h7 is the most forcing and wins material in all variations.\n\n```\nc2h7\n```"
