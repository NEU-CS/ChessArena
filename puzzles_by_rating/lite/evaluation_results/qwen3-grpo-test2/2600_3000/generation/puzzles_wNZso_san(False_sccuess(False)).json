When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, knight and pawns vs White's rook, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on f7\n- White's king is on f3, relatively safe\n- Black's rook on d7 is active but could be vulnerable\n- White's bishop on f4 is very active\n- Black's knight on d6 is well placed but could be challenged\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f7g8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- d6e4: Centralizes the knight and attacks the bishop\n- d6f5: Attacks the h4 pawn but leaves e4 square\n- d7e7: Connects rooks but doesn't address immediate concerns\n\n4. Best move seems to be d6e4:\n- Attacks the active bishop on f4\n- If bishop moves, Black can play d7e7 increasing rook activity\n- If White takes the knight (Bxe4), Black can play d7e7+ winning the bishop\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Keeps all pieces active\n\nOther moves either don't address the active bishop or are too passive. d6e4 is the most forcing and active move.\n\n```\nd6e4\n```"
