When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop, knight and pawns vs White's rook, queen, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h6 is very active\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a knight on h5 that could be dangerous\n- Black's bishop on f6 is pinned to the king by White's rook on g3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8f7: Moves the king away from the pin but exposes it to checks\n- f6d8: Unpins the bishop but allows Qh6xg7\n- f6e5: Moves the bishop but allows Qh6xg7\n- e4e3: Advances the pawn but doesn't address the pin\n- c7f7: Moves the queen to defend g7\n\n4. Best move seems to be c7f7 because:\n- It defends the g7 pawn which is under attack by Qh6\n- It maintains the pin on White's knight\n- It keeps the bishop protected\n- It prepares to potentially double rooks on the f-file\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or create new weaknesses. c7f7 is the most solid move that maintains Black's position.\n\n```\nc7f7\n```"
