When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal, but White's king is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on c2 that's very dangerous\n- White's rook is active on c6\n- Black's king is on g7, White's king on d2\n- Black has a rook on a2 controlling the a-file\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6c8: Rook retreat, but doesn't address the c2 pawn\n- c6c7: Similar to c8, not addressing immediate threats\n- d2e3: Centralizing king, but allows c2c1 promotion\n- d2c3: Captures the dangerous pawn! This seems critical\n- h5h6: Pushing pawn, but doesn't address immediate threats\n\n4. The most pressing issue is the c2 pawn. If we don't capture it, Black will promote. d2c3 captures this pawn while also:\n- Removing Black's most dangerous asset\n- Keeping the king active\n- Maintaining control of key squares\n\nAfter d2c3, if Black plays a2a1, White can play c6a6 to stop the new rook. The position should be winning for White.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nd2c3\n```"
