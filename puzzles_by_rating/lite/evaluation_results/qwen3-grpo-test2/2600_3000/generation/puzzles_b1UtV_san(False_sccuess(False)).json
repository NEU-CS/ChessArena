Material count:\n- White has: Rook, Queen, Knight, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Rook, Queen, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with knight vs no minor piece)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's knight on a7 is very active and threatening\n- Black's king is exposed on c7\n- White's queen on a5 is eyeing the black king\n- Black's rook on d8 is blocked by pawn on d7\n- White has a passed pawn on c5\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- c7b8: Moves king towards corner, but allows Qa5-b6+ winning the rook on d8\n- c7d7: Moves king towards center, but allows Nc5 winning the rook on d8\n- b7b6: Moves pawn, but allows Qa5xb6 winning a pawn\n\n4. Best move is c7d7 because:\n- It prevents Nc5 winning the rook\n- After Qa5-b6, Black can play Rd8-b8 defending the rook\n- It keeps the king more active in the center\n- It's the only move that doesn't immediately lose material\n\nThe other moves all allow immediate material loss, while c7d7 maintains the position.\n\n```\nc7d7\n```"

Evaluation:\n- d7e6 seems most active, centralizing the king\n- After d7e6, White could play Qd2e3+ forcing Ke6f7, but then Black can play Rf8e8 defending\n- d7e7 is safer but passive\n- d7c7 moves away from the action on kingside\n\nThe best move is d7e6, centralizing the king and preparing to activate the rooks. It's the most active choice that doesn't expose the king further.\n\n```\nd7e6\n```"
