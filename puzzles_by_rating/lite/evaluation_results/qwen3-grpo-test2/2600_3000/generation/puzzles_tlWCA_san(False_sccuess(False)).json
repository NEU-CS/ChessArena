When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a knight and bishop vs Black's queen and bishop. Black is up in material (queen vs knight+bishop).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on f5\n- White's king is exposed on g1\n- Black has a passed pawn on a5\n- White has a knight on c3 that could be useful\n- Black's bishop on h3 is pinning White's g3 pawn to the king\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- f3g5: Attacks the queen but allows Qxg5\n- c3d5: Centralizes the knight and attacks the queen\n- c1h6: Develops the bishop and attacks the queen\n- b1e4: Centralizes the knight and defends g3\n\n4. Best move seems to be c3d5:\n- It centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the black queen\n- If queen moves, we can play Bxh6 winning the bishop\n- If queen takes knight (Qxd5), we can play Bxh6 winning the bishop\n- It maintains control of key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address the material deficit or allow Black to maintain pressure. c3d5 is the most active move that creates counterplay.\n\n```\nc3d5\n```"
