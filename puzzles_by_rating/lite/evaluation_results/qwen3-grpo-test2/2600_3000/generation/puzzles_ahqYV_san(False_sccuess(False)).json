When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and rook vs Black's rook and queen. Black is up in material (queen vs bishop).\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on g2 that's one square from promotion\n- White's king is exposed and under pressure\n- Black's queen is very active on h2\n- White has a bishop on d3 that could be useful\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g3g4: Blocks the g-pawn but leaves the king more exposed\n- d3a6: Moves the bishop to safety but doesn't address the g-pawn\n- e2g4: Captures the dangerous g-pawn but allows Qxg4+\n- c1c2: Defends the g2 pawn but is passive\n\n4. Best move seems to be e2g4:\n- It eliminates the immediate threat of the passed pawn promoting\n- After Qxg4+, White can play Kxg4 and the material deficit is reduced\n- It opens the e-file for White's rook\n- It prevents Black from playing Qh1+ next move\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threat or are too passive. Capturing the pawn is the most forcing move that improves White's position.\n\n```\ne2g4\n```"
