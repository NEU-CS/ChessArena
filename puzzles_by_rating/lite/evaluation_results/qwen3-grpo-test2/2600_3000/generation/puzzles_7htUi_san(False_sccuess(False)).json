When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on d4\n- White's queen on d6 is under attack by Black's rook on e2\n- White's king is exposed on g2\n- Black has a passed pawn on d5\n- White has pawn weaknesses on a3 and b3\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- g2g3: Moves king away from potential checks but blocks the rook's file\n- g2f3: Moves king towards center but still leaves queen hanging\n- g2h1: Moves king to corner, seems passive\n- f1f2: Moves rook to defend queen, but allows ...Qxd6\n\n4. Best move is f1f2 because:\n- It defends the queen on d6\n- After Qxd6, Rxd6 and White is fine\n- Other moves either lose the queen or leave the king in danger\n- It maintains material equality while keeping the initiative\n\nThe move f1f2 solves the immediate problem of the hanging queen while maintaining a solid position.\n\n```\nf1f2\n```"
