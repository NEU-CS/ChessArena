When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen on b4 is very active\n- White's queen on c6 is also active but potentially exposed\n- Black has a knight on c3 that's forking White's rook on d2 and pawn on e3\n- White's bishop on f4 is blocked by its own pawn on e3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6e8: Queen checks the king, but Black can block with f7\n- c6d7: Attacks the pawn on c7 while keeping the queen safe\n- d2d3: Captures the knight on c3, but allows Qxd3\n- f4h6: Moves the bishop to safety while attacking h6 pawn\n\n4. Best move seems to be d2d3:\n- It captures the dangerous knight on c3\n- After Qxd3, White can play Qe8+ winning the f7 pawn\n- Even if Black doesn't take, White maintains material equality while removing a key attacker\n\nOther moves either don't address the knight fork or allow Black to maintain initiative. d2d3 is the most forcing and best move.\n\n```\nd2d3\n```"
