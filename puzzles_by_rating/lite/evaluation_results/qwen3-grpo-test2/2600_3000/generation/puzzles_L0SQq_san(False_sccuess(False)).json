When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is on d6, White's king on f6\n- White has a passed pawn on g7 that's very advanced\n- Black has a passed pawn on h3 that's also advanced\n- Black's bishop is on g8, White's bishop on g6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g6e8: Bishop retreat, but doesn't accomplish much\n- g6h7: Bishop moves to h7, attacking the h3 pawn\n- g6f7: Bishop moves to f7, controlling more squares\n- f6g5: King moves towards the h3 pawn\n- f6f5: King moves forward\n\n4. Critical line:\n- If we play g6h7, attacking the h3 pawn, Black must defend it:\n  - If ...Bh7, then Kxh3 wins the pawn\n  - If ...Kd5, then Bxh3 wins the pawn\n  - If ...Bf6, then Kxh3 wins the pawn\n\n5. Other moves either don't address the h3 pawn or allow Black to promote first.\n\nThe most forcing and winning move is g6h7, attacking the h3 pawn and winning it in all variations. This will leave White with a passed g-pawn that can promote while Black's bishop is too far away to stop it.\n\n```\ng6h7\n```"
