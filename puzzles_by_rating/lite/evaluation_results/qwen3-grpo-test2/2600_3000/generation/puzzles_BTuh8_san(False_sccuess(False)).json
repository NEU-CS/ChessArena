When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n- White has: Queen, Rook, Bishop, 3 pawns\n- Black has: Queen, Bishop, 3 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (White has slight edge with bishop vs no bishop)\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's queen is very active on e2, attacking White's rook on c1\n- White's queen on a5 is not very active\n- Black's bishop on g4 is pinning White's pawn on e3 to the king\n- White's king is exposed on f2\n\n3. Evaluating the legal moves:\n- f2g3: Moves king away from pin, but allows Qe2xc2 winning a pawn\n- f2g1: Moves king towards safety, but still allows Qe2xc2\n\n4. Best option:\n- Both moves lose a pawn to Qe2xc2, but f2g1 is slightly better as:\n  - It moves the king towards safer squares (castling area)\n  - It doesn't block the bishop's pin on e3\n  - After Qxc2, White can play Bd2 breaking the pin\n\nThe alternative Qe2xc2 is forced in both cases, but f2g1 minimizes further damage.\n\n```\nf2g1\n```"
