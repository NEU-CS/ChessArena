When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, queen, bishop and pawns vs White's rook, knight, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White's queen on h3 is very active\n- Black's bishop on c5 is blocked by its own pawn on b5\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on e5\n- Black's queen on b7 is somewhat restricted\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- f8e8: Centralizes the rook but doesn't address immediate concerns\n- b7e4: Centralizes the queen and attacks the e5 pawn\n- c5e7: Moves the bishop to a more active diagonal\n- b5b4: Advances the pawn to open lines\n\n4. Best move seems to be b7e4 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the dangerous e5 pawn\n- Prepares to double rooks on the e-file\n- If White takes the queen (Qxe4), Black can play Bxe4 winning the knight on c3\n- It's more active than other options\n\nThe move b7e4 improves Black's piece activity and addresses the most pressing concerns in the position.\n\n```\nb7e4\n```"
