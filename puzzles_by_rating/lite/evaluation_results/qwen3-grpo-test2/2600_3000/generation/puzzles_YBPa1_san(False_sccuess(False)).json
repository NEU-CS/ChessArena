When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a rook, bishop, queen and pawns vs White's rook, queen and pawns. Black is up a bishop but White has some compensation with the active rook on b8.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's rook on b8 is very active\n- Black's queen on c5 is centralized but could be vulnerable\n- White's queen on e2 is protecting the pawn on e3\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g8h8: Gets the king to safety but seems passive\n- c5a7: Attacks the rook on b8 but allows White to play Qe3+\n- e4h4: Moves the rook to a more active file\n- e4e3: Captures the pawn but allows Qxe3+\n- c5d4: Centralizes the queen more\n\n4. Best move seems to be e4e3:\n- It wins a pawn\n- After Qxe3+, Black can play Kh7 and the king is safe\n- White's rook on b8 is no longer so active\n- It opens the e-file for Black's rook\n\nOther moves either don't win material or leave the king exposed. e4e3 is the most forcing and wins material while maintaining king safety.\n\n```\ne4e3\n```"
