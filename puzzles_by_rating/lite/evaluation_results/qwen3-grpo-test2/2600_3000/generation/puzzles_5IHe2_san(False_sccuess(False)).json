When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop and pawns vs Black's rook, bishop, queen and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen on d2 is very active\n- White's queen on c6 is under attack by Black's bishop on f5\n- White's rook on e1 is pinned to the king by Black's queen\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c6e8: Queen moves to e8, attacking the rook on d8. But Black can play Qd2e3 defending.\n- c6d7: Queen moves to d7, blocking the bishop's attack. But Black can play Qd2e3+.\n- c4f7: Bishop moves to f7, attacking the king. This seems promising as it's a discovered check.\n- e1e8: Rook moves to e8, unpins itself and attacks the queen. But Black can play Qd2e3+.\n\n4. Best move appears to be c4f7:\n- It's a discovered check from the bishop\n- After Kf8, White can play Qc6e8 winning the rook\n- Even if Black doesn't take the rook, White maintains the initiative\n- It's the most forcing move in the position\n\nThe move c4f7 creates immediate threats and forces Black to react, giving White the initiative.\n\n```\nc4f7\n```"
