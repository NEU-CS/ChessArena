When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's queen, rook, bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White's queen is very active on e4\n- Black has a pawn on f5 that's weak\n- White has a passed pawn on d3 that could be dangerous\n- Black's bishop on d7 is blocked by its own pawn on e6\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e4c6: Captures the knight, but allows Black to play ...Qxc6\n- e4f5: Captures the weak pawn, but Black can play ...Qxf5\n- f3g5: Attacks the weak f5 pawn\n- d3a6: Moves the passed pawn but it's not immediately threatening\n- c1h6: Develops the bishop with tempo on the king\n\n4. Best move seems to be f3g5:\n- Attacks the weak f5 pawn\n- If Black takes the knight with ...fxg5, White can play Qxg5+ winning the rook on d8\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Qxg5 winning the pawn\n- Black's best is probably ...h6, but then White can play Qxh6+ winning material\n\nOther moves either don't win material or allow Black to consolidate. f3g5 is the most forcing and wins material.\n\n```\nf3g5\n```"
