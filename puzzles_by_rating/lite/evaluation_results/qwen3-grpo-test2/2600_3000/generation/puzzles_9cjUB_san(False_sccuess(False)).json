When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a queen, rook and pawns vs White's queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a passed pawn on a5 that could be dangerous\n- Black's rook on a1 is very active\n- White's queen on c3 is controlling important squares\n- Black's queen on e7 is somewhat restricted by White's pieces\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a1a5: Capturing the passed pawn immediately, but after Qxa5 Black's rook is lost\n- e7f6: Centralizing the queen and attacking the f4 pawn\n- e7d6: Protecting the e5 pawn and maintaining flexibility\n- g8h7: Moving the king to a safer square\n\n4. Best move seems to be e7f6 because:\n- It centralizes the queen\n- Attacks the f4 pawn which is only defended by the king\n- If White takes the rook with Qxa5, Black can play Qxf4 winning a pawn\n- It maintains options for the queen while improving its position\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to gain an advantage. The king move g8h7 is too passive and doesn't address the active play needed.\n\n```\ne7f6\n```"
