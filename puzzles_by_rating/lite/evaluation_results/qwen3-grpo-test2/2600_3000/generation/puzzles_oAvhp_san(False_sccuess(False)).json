When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has a bishop and knight vs White's bishop and knight, so material is equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- White has a passed pawn on b5\n- Black's king is exposed in the center\n- White's bishop on b5 is very active\n- Black's knight on f6 is under pressure from White's pawns\n- Black's dark-squared bishop is blocked by its own pawn on e5\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- h8g8: Castling to safety, but White can play Bc6+ winning the exchange\n- e8e7: Moving the king to safety, but blocks the d8 queen\n- d8e7: Centralizing the queen while defending e5\n- f6e4: Centralizing the knight and attacking the b5 pawn\n- c5d4: Capturing the pawn and opening lines\n\n4. Best move seems to be f6e4:\n- Centralizes the knight\n- Attacks the advanced b5 pawn\n- If White takes the knight (Bxe4), Black can play dxe4 and the b5 pawn is weak\n- If White doesn't take, Black can play Nc3+ winning the b5 pawn\n- Maintains control of key squares\n- Doesn't allow any immediate tactics for White\n\nOther moves either don't improve Black's position or allow White to maintain pressure. f6e4 is the most active and challenging move.\n\n```\nf6e4\n```"
