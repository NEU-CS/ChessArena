When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's king is very active on e7\n- Black's king is stuck on a8\n- Black has a passed pawn on c6 that could be dangerous\n- White has a passed pawn on a7 that's very advanced\n- Black's pawns on f7 and h6 are potential targets\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- a8b7: Gets the king more active but allows a7a8 promotion\n- c6c8: Pushes the passed pawn but it's not clear if it's safe\n- c6d6: Moves the pawn but doesn't accomplish much\n- f7f6: Creates a passed pawn but weakens e6\n- h6h5: Prepares to push h5-h4 but is slow\n- g5g4: Advances the pawn but may be premature\n\n4. Best move seems to be c6c7:\n- Pushes the passed pawn which is very dangerous\n- If white takes (Kxc7), then a7a8 promotes with check\n- If white doesn't take, the pawn can queen\n- Other moves either don't accomplish as much or allow white to promote\n\nThe most forcing and dangerous move is to push the passed pawn immediately.\n\n```\nc6c7\n```"
