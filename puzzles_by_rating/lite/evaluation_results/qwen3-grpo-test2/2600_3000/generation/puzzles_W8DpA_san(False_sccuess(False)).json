When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is on d4, very active\n- White's bishop is on c2, blocked by pawns\n- Black has a passed pawn on e3\n- White has a passed pawn on d5\n- Black's bishop on f2 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- c2h7: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- c2g6: Bishop moves towards center but doesn't address immediate threats\n- c2f5: Bishop attacks e4 pawn, but Black can defend\n- c2e4: Bishop takes e4 pawn - this seems strongest as it removes a defender\n- Other moves don't address the immediate position\n\n4. After c2e4:\n- If Black takes bishop (d4e4), White can play d5d6 creating a passed pawn\n- If Black doesn't take, White maintains pressure\n- This removes a key defender of Black's e3 pawn\n\nThe most forcing and best move is to take the e4 pawn with the bishop, as it:\n- Removes a defender\n- Opens lines for White's pieces\n- Maintains initiative\n\n```\nc2e4\n```"
