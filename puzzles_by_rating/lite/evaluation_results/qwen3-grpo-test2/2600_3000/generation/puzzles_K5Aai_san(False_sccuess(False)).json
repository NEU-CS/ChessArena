When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a rook, bishop, knight and pawns vs Black's rook, queen, bishop and pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features of the position:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8\n- White has a strong bishop on g5 pinning the f6 pawn to the queen\n- Black has a knight on c4 attacking the rook on d5\n- White's queen on h4 is very active\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- g5h6: Bishop takes pawn, but Black can play Qxh6\n- d5d6: Rook moves forward, but allows Nxd6\n- h4h7: Queen checks, but Black can block with Qe7\n- f3e5: Knight moves to centralize, but doesn't create immediate threats\n- e4e5: Pawn push, but Black can play Nxe5\n\n4. Best move seems to be h4h7:\n- It's a check that forces Black to respond\n- After Qe7 (only legal move), White can play Bxf6 winning the bishop\n- Even if Black finds a better defense, White maintains initiative\n\nThe immediate check with h4h7 is most forcing and creates complications that favor White. Black has no good way to handle both the check and the pin on f6.\n\n```\nh4h7\n```"
