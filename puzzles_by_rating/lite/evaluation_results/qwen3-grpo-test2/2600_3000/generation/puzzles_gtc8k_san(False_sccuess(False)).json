When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has a bishop and rook vs Black's bishop, knight and pawns. Material is roughly equal, but Black has more active pieces.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black has a passed pawn on d4 that's very dangerous\n- White's bishop on e6 is very active but potentially trapped\n- Black's knight on c3 is threatening to fork with Nc3e2\n- White's rook on f4 is under attack by Black's pawn on d4\n\n3. Candidate moves to consider:\n- e6g8: Bishop retreat, but seems passive\n- f4f8: Rook retreat, but allows d3\n- c2e4: Blocking the passed pawn while developing the bishop\n- b2c3: Capturing the dangerous knight\n\n4. Best move seems to be b2c3:\n- Removes the dangerous knight that was threatening to fork\n- Opens the b-file for White's rook\n- After Nxc3, Bxc3 maintains material equality while removing threats\n- If Black doesn't take, White can play Bxc3 next move\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or are too passive. b2c3 is the most active and\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898 move.\n\n```\nb2c3\n```"
