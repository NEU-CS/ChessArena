When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is on c8, putting pressure on the white king.\n- White's rook on e5 is very active, controlling important squares.\n- Black's bishop on c5 is blocking the queen's diagonal.\n- White's knight on a3 is not very active currently.\n- Black's pawn on g2 is threatening to promote.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\nOnly legal move is h1h2, which seems to be a defensive move to prevent the g2 pawn from promoting.\n\n4. Analysis of h1h2:\n- After h1h2, black can play g2g1=Q, but then white can capture with the rook (e5g5) and the queen is exposed.\n- Alternatively, black might not push the pawn immediately, but h1h2 at least prevents the promotion threat.\n\n5. Other considerations:\n- There are no other legal moves, so we must play h1h2.\n- Not playing h1h2 would allow black to promote the pawn next move, which would be disastrous.\n\nConclusion: The only move is to play defensively and prevent the pawn from promoting. \n\n```\nh1h2\n```"
