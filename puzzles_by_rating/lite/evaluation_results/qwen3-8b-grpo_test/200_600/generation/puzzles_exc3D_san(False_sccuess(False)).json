When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has bishop, knight, queen, pawns. Black has queen, bishop, knight, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on e8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White's queen is on f3, putting pressure on black's position.\n- The bishop on d4 is very active, controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's queen on c7 is blocking the c8 rook.\n- The knight on g5 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g5h7: Attacks the queen and threatens to win material. After Qxh7, Qxh7 Nxh7 and white is up a queen.\n- g5f7: Attacks the queen and pawn. After Qxf7, Qxf7 Nxf7 and white is up a queen.\n- d4a7: Bishop to a7, putting pressure on the queen. But black can just move the queen.\n- f3d5: Queen to d5, increasing pressure on the black king.\n- c3d5: Knight to d5, attacking the queen.\n\nAfter considering all options, g5h7 seems the most promising:\n- It forces black to either give up the queen or allow a material gain.\n- If black doesn't take the knight, we can win the queen next move.\n- Even if black takes the knight, we recapture the queen and are up material.\n\nThe move is both aggressive and forces black into a losing position. Other moves either don't capitalize on our active pieces or allow black to consolidate their position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5h7\n```"
