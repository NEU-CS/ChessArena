When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, pawns). Black has a slight lead in development with both bishops and knights active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is on c2, potentially exposed\n- Black's queen is on c7, controlling important diagonals\n- The e5 pawn is a potential target\n- Both sides have castling rights (KQ in FEN)\n- The f5 knight is well placed, attacking multiple squares\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e6c8: Bishop to c8, defending the queen and putting pressure on f5\n- f5e7: Knight to e7, attacking the queen and putting pressure on d5\n- c7d7: Queen to d7, increasing pressure on the center\n- f5h6: Knight to h6, attacking g4 and putting pressure on the kingside\n- a8e8: Rook to e8, doubling on the e-file\n\nAfter considering these options, e6c8 seems most promising:\n1. It defends the queen\n2. It puts pressure on the f5 knight\n3. It prepares to double rooks or go to d6\n4. It doesn't allow White to play Qd3 or Qb4 with threats\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow White to become more active. The move e6c8 maintains our slight advantage and doesn't give White any counterplay.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne6c8\n```"
