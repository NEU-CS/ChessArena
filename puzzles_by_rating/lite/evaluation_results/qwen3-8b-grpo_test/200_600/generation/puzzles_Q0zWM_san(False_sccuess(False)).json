When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has rook and pawn. Black has bishop, knight and pawn. Black is up a bishop and pawn, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on g5, also not very safe.\n\n3. Rook activity: The rook on b5 is very active, controlling the b-file and putting pressure on black's pawns.\n\n4. Pawn structure: White's pawn on e3 is blocked and not very useful. Black's pawn on e4 is also blocked.\n\n5. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Rook moves: b5b8 looks tempting to attack the black king, but after ...Kf6 the rook has no good follow-up. b5f5 attacks the e4 pawn but allows ...Bxf5 after ...Kxf5.\n- King moves: g2h3 gets the king to a safer square but doesn't address immediate threats.\n- Pawn moves: g3g4 creates a passed pawn but doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n\nAfter considering all options, b5b8 seems the most aggressive move, putting pressure on black's king. While it's not immediately winning, it's the most active move that creates threats. Black will have to respond to the rook's attack on the king.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play the rook to b8, putting maximum pressure on black's position.\n\n```\nb5b8\n```"
