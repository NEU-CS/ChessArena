When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is on d8, putting pressure on black's king on g8.\n- Black's queen is on f5, controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's rook on c8 is very active, controlling the c-file.\n- White's king is exposed on c1 with limited pawn cover.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c8d8: Rook trade. After Qxd8, Qxd8 exd8 and white is up a queen. Not good.\n- e7e8: Rook move to e8. This seems to defend the king and potentially coordinate with the queen.\n\n4. Best move:\ne7e8 is the only move that doesn't immediately lose material. After this:\n- If white takes the rook with Qxe8, we can play Qxe8 and the position is simplified but playable.\n- Other white moves don't seem to create immediate threats.\n\nc8d8 leads to a forced loss after Qxd8 exd8 and white is up a queen. Therefore, e7e8 is the only reasonable move.\n\n```\ne7e8\n```"
