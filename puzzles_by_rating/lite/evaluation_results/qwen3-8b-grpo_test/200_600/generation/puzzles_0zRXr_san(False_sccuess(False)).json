When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on c5, putting pressure on white's position.\n- White's queen is on b2, somewhat exposed.\n- Black's rook on d8 is controlling the d-file.\n- White's rook on g3 is very active, attacking black's pawns and putting pressure on the black king.\n- The bishop on c6 is blocking the queen's diagonal.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g3g6: Rook trade. After ...Rxg6, Qxg6 and white is up a rook. But black can play ...Qd8 instead, defending the rook.\n- b2h8: Queen trade. After ...Qxh8, Rfxh8 and white is up a queen. But black can play ...Qd8 instead.\n- c1c5: Rook lift to c5, defending the queen and putting pressure on black's queen.\n- c1g1: Rook lift to g1, defending the pawn on h2.\n\nAfter considering all options, g3g6 seems the most promising:\n- If black takes the rook with ...Rxg6, we play Qxg6 and are up a rook.\n- If black doesn't take, we can consider Qxg7 or other aggressive moves.\n\nThe move b2h8 is also interesting but allows black to defend with ...Qd8.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most forcing and winning move is to trade rooks and then win material.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng3g6\n```"
