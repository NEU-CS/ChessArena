When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is on e8, putting pressure on black's king on g8.\n- Black's queen is on g5, controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's rook on d8 is very active, controlling the d-file.\n- White's king is exposed on h1 with limited pawn cover.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d8e8: Rook trade. After Qxe8, Qxe8 Rxe8 and white is up a queen. Not good.\n- g6f8: Queen trade. After Qxf8, Rxf8 and white is up a queen. Also not good.\n\nWait, both moves lead to losing material. Is there any other option? No, these are the only legal moves.\n\nBut let's think deeper:\n- After d8e8 Qxe8, we can play Qxe8 and then Rxe8, but white is up a queen.\n- After g6f8 Qxf8, we can play Rxf8, but again white is up a queen.\n\nIs there any defensive resource? The king is in a bad position. Maybe we can try to create some counterplay with the bishop or knight?\n\nBut according to the legal moves list, we can only play d8e8 or g6f8. Both lead to material loss.\n\nIn this case, g6f8 seems slightly better because after Qxf8 Rxf8, we can play Rxf8 and at least get some activity with the rook. Whereas d8e8 leads to a more straightforward material loss.\n\nTherefore, the least worse move is:\n\n```\ng6f8\n```"
