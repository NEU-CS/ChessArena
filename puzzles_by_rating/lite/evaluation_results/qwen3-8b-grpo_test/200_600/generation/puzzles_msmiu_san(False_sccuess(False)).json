When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has bishop and pawn, black has knight and pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's knight on f1 is very active, attacking multiple squares.\n- White's bishop on h5 is controlling important diagonals but can be challenged.\n- The pawn structure is locked with pawns on f5 and g5.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- h5e8: Bishop to e8. This would attack the knight but allow ...Nxe8 and black is up a bishop.\n- h5f7: Bishop to f7. This defends the pawn on g6 but doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n- h5g6: Bishop to g6. This attacks the pawn on f5 but allows ...Nxg6 and black is up a bishop.\n- f3g2: King to g2. This gets away from the knight's attacks but doesn't improve our position.\n- g5g6: Pawn to g6. This breaks the pawn structure but creates a passed pawn.\n\nAfter considering all options, g5g6 seems the most promising:\n- It creates a passed pawn that could potentially advance\n- It forces black to deal with the pawn\n- Other moves either lose material or don't improve our position\n\nThe other moves either allow black to win material or don't accomplish anything meaningful. While g5g6 creates some weaknesses, it's the most active move that creates counterplay.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng5g6\n```"
