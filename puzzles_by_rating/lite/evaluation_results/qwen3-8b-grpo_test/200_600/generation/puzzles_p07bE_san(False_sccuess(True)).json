When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is equal but white's queen is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is on d8, putting pressure on black's king on h8.\n- Black's queen is on h4, attacking white's pawn on c4 and putting pressure on the white king.\n- Black's bishop on f6 is controlling important diagonals.\n- White's bishop on a2 is not very active.\n- White has a pawn on a4 that could become a target.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\nOnly legal move is f6d8 (bishop takes queen).\n\n4. Analysis of f6d8:\n- After Bxd8, Qxd8 and white is up a queen. This seems losing.\n- Is there any way to defend the queen after Bxd8? No, white can just take it.\n\n5. Conclusion:\nThe only legal move loses material immediately. However, since it's the only move available, we must play it.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf6d8\n```"
