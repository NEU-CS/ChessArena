When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black is up a pawn but has a material advantage.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on d8, controlling the back rank.\n- White's king is exposed on g1 with limited pawn cover.\n- Black has a bishop on a2 controlling the a2-g8 diagonal.\n- White's rook on c3 is very active, controlling the c-file.\n- The knight on e5 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- e2f1: Moves the queen to f1, defending the king and putting pressure on the black queen.\n- e2d1: Moves the queen to d1, defending the rook on c3 and controlling the d-file.\n\nAfter considering both options:\n- e2f1 seems more active, putting pressure on the black queen and potentially creating threats against the black king.\n- e2d1 is more defensive, protecting the rook but less aggressive.\n\nThe best move is to play actively and put pressure on Black's position. Therefore, the move is:\n\n```\ne2f1\n```"
