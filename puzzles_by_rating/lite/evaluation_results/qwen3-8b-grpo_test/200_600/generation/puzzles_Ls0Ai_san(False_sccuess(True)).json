When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

First, let's understand the position:\n   - Black's king is at b8, white's king at g2\n   - Black has a rook at g8 and pawns at c7, d7, e7, g3\n   - White has a rook at e1 and e8, pawns at a2, b2, g2\n   - It's Black's turn to move (b in FEN)\n\n2. The only legal move is g8e8 (Rook takes Rook). Let's see what happens after this:\n   - After Rxe8, White can recapture with Kxe8 or Rxe8\n   - If Kxe8, Black has pawns at c7, d7, e7 that can advance\n   - If Rxe8, Black can play Kxe8 and the position is simplified\n\n3. Alternative options:\n   - There are no other legal moves available (only g8e8 is listed)\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - The only move is to exchange rooks. After the exchange, Black's pawns become more active and the king is safer. The position is likely drawn but Black has some counterplay with the pawns.\n\nSince there's only one legal move, we must play it:\n\n```\ng8e8\n```"
