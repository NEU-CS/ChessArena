When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n   - White has: Rook (d1), Rook (a8), Bishop (c4), Bishop (a2), Knight (c6), Pawn (e4, b3, f5, h2)\n   - Black has: Rook (c8), Rook (d8), Bishop (a2), Pawn (a6, f5, g7)\n   - White is up a bishop and pawn, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety:\n   - Black's king is exposed on e8 with limited pawn cover.\n   - White's king is on c2, somewhat exposed but not immediately threatened.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n   - Only legal move is c8d8 (Rook c8 to d8).\n\n4. Analysis of c8d8:\n   - After Rd8, White can play Rxd8, winning the exchange (rook for rook).\n   - However, after Rxd8, Black can play Bxd8, and White is up a bishop.\n   - There are no immediate threats or tactics that can save the position.\n\n5. Other considerations:\n   - The position is lost due to material deficit.\n   - The only move is to exchange rooks and hope for a mistake.\n\nSince there's only one legal move and the position is lost, we must play it:\n\n```\nc8d8\n```"
