When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has a slight lead in development.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on g6, putting pressure on f7 and h6 squares.\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8) and hasn't castled yet.\n- White has a strong bishop on d3 controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's pawn structure is solid but somewhat rigid.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- The only legal move is h7g6 (Nxg6). Let's analyze this:\n  - After Nxg6, hxg6 opens the h-file and gives White a passed pawn on h7.\n  - White can then play Qxg6, putting pressure on f7 and h8.\n  - Black's position becomes somewhat exposed with the king in the center.\n\n4. Other considerations:\n- There are no other legal moves available, so we must play h7g6.\n- After Nxg6 hxg6, Black can consider castling or defending f7.\n\nSince h7g6 is the only legal move, we must play it. While it doesn't look great, it's the only option available.\n\n```\nh7g6\n```"
