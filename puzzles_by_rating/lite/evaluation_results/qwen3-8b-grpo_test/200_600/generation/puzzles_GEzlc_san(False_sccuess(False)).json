When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is on d5, putting pressure on the white king.\n- White's queen is on e3, controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's king is on f8, somewhat exposed.\n- White has a passed pawn on c6 that could become dangerous.\n- The bishop on b8 is very active, controlling important diagonals.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e3a7: Queen trade. After Qxa7, Rxa7 and white is up a queen. But black can play Qxa7 and then Rxa7, and white is up a queen. This seems winning.\n- e3b6: Defends the c5 square and puts pressure on the queen.\n- c2c5: Attacks the queen and opens up the position.\n- c6c7: Advances the passed pawn.\n\nAfter considering all options, e3a7 seems the most forcing and winning move. It forces a queen trade that leaves white up material. Even if black tries to complicate with ...Qxa7, white can simply play Rxa7 and is up a queen.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to force the queen trade and win material.\n\n```\ne3a7\n```"
