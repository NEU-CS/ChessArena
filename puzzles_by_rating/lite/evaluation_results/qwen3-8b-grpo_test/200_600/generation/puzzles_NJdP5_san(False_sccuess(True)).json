When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n   - White has queen, bishop, pawn\n   - Black has rook, pawn\n   - White is up a queen and bishop, which is a decisive material advantage.\n\n2. King safety:\n   - Black's king is exposed on f8\n   - White's king is on g2, relatively safe\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n   - f8g8: moves the king to the corner\n   - f8e8: moves the king towards the center\n\n4. Analysis:\n   - f8g8: After Qd6+ or Qe7+, black is in trouble as the king has no good squares\n   - f8e8: After Qd6+, black can play Rf8, but white can just take the rook\n   - Both moves lead to immediate material loss or checkmate\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - The position is lost regardless of the move\n   - f8e8 at least forces white to prove the win, while f8g8 is more passive\n\nAfter considering both options, the least worse move is to play f8e8, as it at least forces white to actively demonstrate the win rather than passively allowing it.\n\n```\nf8e8\n```"
