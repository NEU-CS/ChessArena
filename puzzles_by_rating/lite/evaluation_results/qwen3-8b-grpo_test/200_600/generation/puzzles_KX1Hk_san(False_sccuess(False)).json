When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on e5, putting pressure on black's position.\n- Black's rook on f8 is not very active currently.\n- White has a passed pawn on f4 that could become dangerous.\n- Black's king is exposed on h8.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Rook moves (f8g8, f8e8, etc): Moving the rook to a more active square seems logical. f8e8 could defend the pawn on d6 and put pressure on the queen.\n- Pawn moves (h7h6, g7g6, etc): Pushing the pawns doesn't seem to address immediate threats.\n- Bishop moves: The bishop on d6 is blocked by its own pawn on c5.\n\nAfter considering all options, f8e8 seems like the most solid move:\n- It defends the d6 pawn\n- It puts pressure on the white queen\n- It activates the rook\n- It doesn't allow white to play any dangerous tactics\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow white to maintain too much pressure. Therefore, the best move is to activate the rook to e8.\n\n```\nf8e8\n```"
