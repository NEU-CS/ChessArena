When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is on f1, putting pressure on white's king.\n- White's queen is on c4, controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's knight on c6 is well placed, controlling key squares.\n- White's rook on a1 is not very active.\n- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Only legal move is c4f1 (Qxf1). Let's analyze this:\n  - After Qxf1, Black can recapture with Rxf1 or Qxf1.\n  - If Rxf1, White can play Rxf1 and the position is roughly equal.\n  - If Qxf1, White can play Rxf1 and again the position is equal.\n\n4. Other considerations:\n- There are no other legal moves, so we must play Qxf1.\n- The move doesn't lose material immediately and leads to an equal position after exchanges.\n\nAfter considering all options, the only move is to capture the queen.\n\n```\nc4f1\n```"
