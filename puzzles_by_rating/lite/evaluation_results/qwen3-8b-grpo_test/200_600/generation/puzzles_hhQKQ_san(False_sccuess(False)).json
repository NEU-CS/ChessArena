When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook and pawns. White has rook, bishop and pawns. White is up a bishop.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on e8 is very active, controlling the e-file and putting pressure on white's position.\n- White's bishop on d1 is not very active currently.\n- White's king is exposed on g1 with limited pawn cover.\n- Black's king is on h8, somewhat exposed.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Rook moves (e8g8, e8f8, etc): Moving the rook to a more active square or to defend the king.\n- Pawn moves (h7h6, g7g6, etc): Pushing pawns to create threats or gain space.\n\nThe most promising moves seem to be the rook moves. Let's evaluate them:\n\ne8g8: Defends the king and connects with the other rook (if there was one). But after white plays Rf1, the rook becomes less active.\n\ne8f8: Similar to e8g8 but less defensive.\n\ne8e7: Moves the rook to a more central position, putting pressure on white's pawns.\n\nAfter considering all options, e8e7 seems the most active move:\n- It puts pressure on white's e5 pawn\n- It prevents white from playing Rf5 to defend the pawn\n- It maintains control over the e-file\n\nThe other moves either don't improve our position or make the rook less active. Therefore, the best move is to play the rook to e7, putting pressure on white's position.\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
