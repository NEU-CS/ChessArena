When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Current position analysis:\n   - White has king at g6, pawns at h5 and g4\n   - Black has king at d2, pawn at b3\n   - It's White's turn to move (55th move)\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - Both sides have only kings and pawns left\n   - White's pawns are advanced but not yet promoted\n   - Black's pawn is on b3 and can potentially promote if not stopped\n   - The kings are relatively close to each other\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n   - g6h7: Moves king towards black's pawn but allows black to play d2c2 and stop the pawn\n   - g6g7: Doesn't seem to accomplish much\n   - g6f7: Moves king away from both pawns\n   - h5h6: Advances the h-pawn but doesn't seem critical yet\n   - g4g5: Advances the g-pawn but doesn't seem immediately useful\n\n4. Best move reasoning:\n   - The most important factor is to stop black's b-pawn from promoting\n   - g6h7 seems to be the most active move, putting pressure on the b-pawn\n   - After g6h7, black would likely play d2c2 to stop the pawn\n   - Then white can play h7g7 to control the c2 square\n   - This creates a situation where white can potentially stop the pawn while advancing their own\n\n5. Other options:\n   - Moving the pawns (h5h6 or g4g5) don't address the immediate threat of black's pawn\n   - Moving the king to other squares (g6f7, etc.) are too passive\n\nAfter considering all options, the most proactive move that addresses the main threat is to play g6h7, putting pressure on black's pawn while improving our king position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng6h7\n```"
