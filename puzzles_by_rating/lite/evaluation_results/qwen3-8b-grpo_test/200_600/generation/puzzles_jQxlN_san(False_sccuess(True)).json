When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, pawns). Black has a slight lead in development.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on h5, putting pressure on f7 and e6 squares.\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8) and hasn't castled yet.\n- The f6 square is a potential weak point that White could exploit.\n- Black's bishop on e7 is blocking the queen's defense of f8.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e8f8 (king move): Gets the king to a safer square and connects with the rook. However, it doesn't address the immediate threats.\n- e7f6 (bishop move): Blocks the queen's attack on f7 and opens up the e5 square for the rook. It also prevents White from playing Qe4+ in the future.\n\nAfter considering both options, e7f6 seems more promising because:\n1. It directly addresses the queen's pressure on f7\n2. It opens up lines for Black's pieces\n3. It prevents White from gaining an initiative with Qe4+\n4. It maintains control over key central squares\n\nThe move e8f8 is too passive and doesn't improve Black's position. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne7f6\n```"
