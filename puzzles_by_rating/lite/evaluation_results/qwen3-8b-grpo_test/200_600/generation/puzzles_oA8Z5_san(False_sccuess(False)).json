When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight vs white's queen, rook, bishop, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is on e2, controlling important squares.\n- Black's queen is on g5, putting pressure on white's position.\n- Black's rooks are on d8 and e8, not very active yet.\n- White's king is on g1, somewhat exposed.\n- Black's knight on c6 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g5e7: Queen trade. After Qxe7, Rxe7 and white is fine. Not great.\n- g5f6: Attacks the pawn on f2 and puts pressure on the king.\n- e8e7: Defends the queen and connects the rooks.\n- d8c8: Moves the rook to a more active position.\n- c6b8: Moves the knight to a less active square.\n- e5d4: Pawn trade, but white can just take it back.\n\nAfter considering all options, g5f6 seems most promising:\n- It attacks the f2 pawn which is only defended by the queen.\n- If white defends with Qd4, we can play Qf5 with threats.\n- It puts pressure on white's king position.\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow white to consolidate. Therefore, the best move is to play the queen to f6, creating threats against white's pawn and king.\n\n```\ng5f6\n```"
