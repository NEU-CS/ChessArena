When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

After Kc5, white can play Kf6 and start approaching the a6 pawn.\n2. b4a5: Moves king towards a6 pawn. After Ka5, white can play Ke4 and start approaching the a6 pawn.\n3. b4c4: Moves king sideways. Doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n4. b4a4: Moves king to a4. White can respond with Ke4, getting closer to the a6 pawn.\n5. b4c3: Moves king away from both pawns. Not very promising.\n6. b4b3: Moves king down the b-file. White can respond with Ke4.\n7. b4a3: Moves king to a3. White can respond with Ke4.\n8. a6a5: Pushes the pawn. After a5, white can play Kf6 and start approaching the pawn.\n\nThe key idea is to try to defend the a6 pawn while preventing the white king from reaching it. The move b4c5 seems most promising because:\n- It cuts off the white king from the a6 pawn\n- It maintains control over the b5 square\n- It doesn't allow white to make progress towards the a6 pawn\n\nAfter b4c5, white's best response would be Kf6, but then we can play Kd6, maintaining control over the pawn. The position is drawn if both sides play correctly.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play the king towards the white pawn while keeping an eye on our own pawn.\n\n```\nb4c5\n```"
