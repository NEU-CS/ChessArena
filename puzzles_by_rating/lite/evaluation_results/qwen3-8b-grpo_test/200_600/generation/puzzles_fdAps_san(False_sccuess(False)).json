When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, pawns). Black has a slight lead in development with both bishops and knights active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on f4, putting pressure on f7 and e5 squares.\n- Black's queen is on d8, somewhat exposed.\n- The f6 bishop is blocking the rook on f8.\n- The c4 pawn is isolated and could become a target.\n- Both sides have castled positions.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d8e7: Gets the queen to a more active position and connects with the rook. Also defends f5 square.\n- d8c7: Defends the bishop on f6 and puts pressure on the c4 pawn.\n- f6e7: Trades off the active bishop but opens up the f8 rook.\n- b6d7: Develops the bishop and defends e5 square.\n- e6e5: Pushes the pawn to challenge white's queen.\n\nAfter considering all options, d8e7 seems most promising:\n1. Gets the queen to a more active central position\n2. Connects with the rook on f8\n3. Defends the f5 square\n4. Doesn't allow white to maintain too much pressure\n\nOther moves either don't address white's active queen or allow white to maintain the initiative. The move d8e7 improves black's piece coordination while reducing white's attacking options.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd8e7\n```"
