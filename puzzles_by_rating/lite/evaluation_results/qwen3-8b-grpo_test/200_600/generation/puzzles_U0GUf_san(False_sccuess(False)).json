When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, pawn. Black has queen, rook, knight, pawn. Black is up a knight.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on b2, controlling the a1-h8 diagonal and putting pressure on the white king.\n- White's queen is on a8, not very active currently.\n- Black's rook on c4 is very powerful, controlling the c-file and putting pressure on white's pawns.\n- The knight on g4 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- White's king is exposed on h1.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Queen moves (a8h8, a8g8, etc): Moving the queen to a more active square seems logical. a8b7 looks interesting to put pressure on the black queen.\n- Rook moves (b1b2, b1g1, etc): b1b2 seems to defend the pawn and trade queens, but after Qxb2, white is down material.\n- Pawn moves (g2g3, a2a3, etc): g2g3 could be considered to block the knight, but it's not very urgent.\n\nAfter considering all options, a8b7 seems the most promising:\n- It attacks the black queen, forcing it to move or be captured.\n- If black moves the queen, white can consider activating the rook or improving the position.\n- It also prevents black from playing Qa1+ in the future.\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or allow black to maintain too much pressure. Therefore, the best move is to activate the queen and put pressure on black's queen.\n\n```\na8b7\n```"
