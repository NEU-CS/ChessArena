When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop. White has queen, knight, bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on f3, putting pressure on black's position.\n- Black's queen is on c6, controlling important diagonals but potentially exposed.\n- The bishop on a6 is blocking the rook on c7 from defending the queen.\n- The pawn on f5 is isolated and could become a target.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c6e8: Queen trade. After Qxe8, Rxe8 and white is up a queen. Not good.\n- c6a8: Queen to a8. Doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n- c7c8: Rook to c8. Defends the queen but seems passive.\n- c6d7: Queen to d7. Defends the rook and controls more squares.\n- f7f6: Pawn to f6. Creates some counterplay but doesn't address immediate threats.\n- e6e5: Pawn to e5. Blocks the queen's diagonal but gives up control of d4.\n\nAfter considering all options, c6d7 seems the most solid move:\n- Defends the rook on c7\n- Controls important central squares\n- Doesn't allow white to play a dangerous attack\n- Maintains flexibility in the position\n\nOther moves either don't address white's active queen or give up material. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nc6d7\n```"
