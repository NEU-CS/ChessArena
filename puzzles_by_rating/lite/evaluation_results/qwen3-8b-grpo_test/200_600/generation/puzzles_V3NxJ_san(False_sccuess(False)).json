When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has bishop, rook, pawn. Black has bishop, rook, pawn. Material is equal but black has an extra pawn (c5 vs d5).\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on c5 is very active, controlling the c-file and putting pressure on white's pawns.\n- White's bishop on c3 is blocked by its own pawn on d4.\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous if advanced.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c3a5: Bishop to a5. Attacks the rook on c5 and puts pressure on black's pawn structure. After ...Rc7, white can play e6 to advance the passed pawn.\n- b1b8: Rook to b8. Attacks the bishop on b8 and puts pressure on black's king. But black can just move the bishop.\n- c5c6: Pawn to c6. Blocks the rook and creates a passed pawn. But black can just take it back.\n- g1h1: King move. Seems passive but gets the king to a safer square.\n\nAfter considering all options, c3a5 seems the most promising:\n1. It attacks the active rook on c5\n2. If black moves the rook, we can consider advancing our e-pawn\n3. It doesn't allow black to maintain all their pressure\n\nThe move also prevents black from playing ...Rc7 to double on the c-file. \n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc3a5\n```"
