When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is on e2, putting pressure on white's position.\n- White's king is exposed on b1.\n- Black has a rook on e8 controlling the e-file.\n- White's knight on c5 is well placed, attacking d7 and e6 squares.\n- The pawn structure is locked with pawns on d4 and g4.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d3d1: Moves the queen to d1. This would:\n  * Defend the pawn on c2\n  * Put pressure on the black queen\n  * Potentially coordinate with the rook on h1\n- h1e1: Moves the rook to e1. This would:\n  * Defend the queen\n  * Control the e-file\n  * But seems passive\n\n4. Best move reasoning:\nd3d1 seems more active:\n- It directly challenges black's queen\n- If black takes the queen with Qxd1, we can recapture with the rook\n- It also prevents black from playing Qe1 in the future\n- The move improves our piece coordination\n\nh1e1 is too passive and doesn't address the immediate threats.\n\nAfter considering both options, d3d1 is the more active and challenging move that puts pressure on black's position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd3d1\n```"
