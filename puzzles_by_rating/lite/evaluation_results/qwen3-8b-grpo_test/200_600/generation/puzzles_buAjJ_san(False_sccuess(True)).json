When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is on d8, putting pressure on black's king on h8.\n- Black's queen is on f5, attacking the pawn on e4 and putting pressure on white's position.\n- White's knight on f6 is very active, controlling key squares.\n- Black's bishop on c6 is blocking the queen's diagonal.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- The only legal move is b6d8 (bishop takes queen). Let's analyze this:\n  - After b6d8, white can recapture with the rook (g1d1) or pawn (e2d3).\n  - If white recaptures with the rook, black can play qf7, attacking the rook and putting pressure on the white king.\n  - If white recaptures with the pawn, black can play qe7, attacking the pawn and putting pressure on the white position.\n\n4. Other considerations:\n- There are no other legal moves, so we must play b6d8.\n- This move exchanges our bishop for white's queen, which is a significant material gain.\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move is to capture the queen with the bishop.\n\n```\nb6d8\n```"
