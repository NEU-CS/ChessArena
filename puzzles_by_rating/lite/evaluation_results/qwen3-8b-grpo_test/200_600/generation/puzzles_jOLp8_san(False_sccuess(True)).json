When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is on e5, putting pressure on the white king.\n- White's queen is on g4, defending the pawn on d4 and putting pressure on f5.\n- Black has a rook on f8 controlling the f-file.\n- White's king is exposed on f2.\n- The pawn structure is locked with pawns on d4 and c5.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Only legal move is f2f1 (king moves to f1).\n\n4. Analysis of f2f1:\n- Gets the king to a slightly safer square.\n- Avoids any immediate tactics involving the queen checks.\n- Doesn't allow black to play Qe4+ or similar threats.\n- Maintains control over the g2 square.\n\n5. Other considerations:\n- There are no other legal moves, so we must play f2f1.\n- After f2f1, black may play Qe4 or Qf5, but white can respond appropriately.\n\nSince f2f1 is the only legal move, and it's a reasonable defensive move that doesn't worsen our position, we must play it.\n\n```\nf2f1\n```"
