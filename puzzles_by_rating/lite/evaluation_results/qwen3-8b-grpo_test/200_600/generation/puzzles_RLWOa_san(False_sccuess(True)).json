When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on e8, putting pressure on black's king.\n- Black's queen is on d5, controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's king is exposed on g8.\n- White has a bishop on f5 controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's knight on d3 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\nOnly legal move is a8e8 (rook move). Let's see what happens after this move:\n- After a8e8, white can play Qxe8, and black must recapture with the bishop (b7xe4).\n- Then white can play Qxe4, and black is down material.\n\n4. Alternative ideas:\nThere are no other legal moves available. The rook on a8 is not very active currently, so moving it to e8 to defend the king seems forced.\n\n5. Conclusion:\nThe move a8e8 is forced, despite leading to material loss after white's Qxe8. There are no better options available.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\na8e8\n```"
