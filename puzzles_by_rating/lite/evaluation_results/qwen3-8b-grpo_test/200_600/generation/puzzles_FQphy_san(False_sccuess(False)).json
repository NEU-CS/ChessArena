When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop. White has queen, rook, bishop. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is on e2, controlling important squares.\n- Black's queen is on b6, putting pressure on white's position.\n- Black's rook on d8 is very active, controlling the d-file.\n- White's bishop on f5 is blocking the pawn on d5.\n- Black's bishop on d4 is very strong, controlling important diagonals.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d8f8: Rook trade. After Qxf8, Qxf8 Rxf8 and white is fine. Not great.\n- d8e8: Defends e7 square, but doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n- b6c7: Queen trade. After Qxc7, Rxc7 and white is fine.\n- d4f6: Bishop trade. After Bxf6, Qxf6 and white is fine.\n- d4e5: Bishop move, but doesn't seem to improve position.\n- b6g6: Queen to g6, threatening to take f5 bishop.\n- f7f6: Pawn move, but doesn't seem to help.\n\nAfter considering all options, b6g6 seems most promising:\n- It attacks the f5 bishop which is defending important squares\n- If white defends with Qd5, we can play Qxg2 winning a pawn\n- If white doesn't defend, we can take the bishop\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow white to consolidate. The move b6g6 creates immediate threats and forces white to react.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nb6g6\n```"
