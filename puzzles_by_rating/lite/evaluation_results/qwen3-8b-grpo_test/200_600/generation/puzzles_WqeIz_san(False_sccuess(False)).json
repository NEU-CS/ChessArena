When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, two rooks, two bishops, knight, pawns). Black has a slight lead in development with their queen and bishop active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on f5, putting pressure on f2 and e3.\n- White's bishop on c4 is blocked by its own pawn on d3.\n- The knight on f4 is well placed, controlling key squares.\n- Black's king is exposed on g7 with limited pawn cover.\n- White has a potential discovered attack opportunity with the bishop on c4.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c4g8: Bishop sacrifice to win the exchange. After ...Qxg8, Qxg8 Kxg8 and White is up a rook. But Black might not take the bishop.\n- c4f7: Blocking the queen and attacking the pawn. Black would likely play ...Qe6 or ...Qd7.\n- e3a7: Queen trade. After ...Qxa7, White can play Rxa7 and is up a queen. But Black might not take the queen.\n- d2d6: Rook lift to d6, putting pressure on f6 and e6 squares.\n- g1h2: King safety move, but seems passive.\n\nAfter considering all options, c4g8 seems the most promising:\n- If Black takes the bishop with ...Qxg8, White recaptures with the queen and is up a rook.\n- If Black doesn't take the bishop, White can consider other attacks or simply improve the position.\n\nThe move creates immediate threats and forces Black to react. Other moves either don't address Black's active queen or miss this opportunity.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc4g8\n```"
