When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material count:\n   - White: Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, 2 pawns\n   - Black: Rook, Queen, Bishop, pawn\n   - White is up a pawn but black has active pieces\n\n2. Key features:\n   - Black's queen is on c1, controlling the c-file and putting pressure on white's king\n   - White's queen is on b7, controlling the b-file and putting pressure on black's pawns\n   - Black's rook on c8 is very active, controlling the c-file\n   - White's knight on b3 is well placed, attacking multiple squares\n   - Black's bishop on e3 is blocking the pawn on d2\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n   - Only legal move is b3c1 (Nc1)\n\n4. Analysis of b3c1:\n   - After Nc1, black can play Qxc1, but then white can recapture with the queen (Qxc1)\n   - This would lead to a queen exchange, leaving white with a material advantage\n   - Alternatively, black might not take the knight immediately, but the knight is under attack and needs to be saved\n\n5. Other considerations:\n   - There are no other legal moves, so we must play b3c1\n   - The move doesn't seem to offer immediate tactics, but it's the only way to avoid losing material\n\nAfter considering all options, the only move is to save the knight with:\n\n```\nb3c1\n```"
