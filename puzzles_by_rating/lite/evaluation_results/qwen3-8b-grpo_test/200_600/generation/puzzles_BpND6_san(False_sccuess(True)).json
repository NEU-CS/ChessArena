When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on b5, putting pressure on black's position.\n- Black's queen is on h3, attacking the pawn on g2 and putting pressure on the white king.\n- Black's rook on f6 is very active, controlling the f-file.\n- White's knight on e3 is well placed, defending key squares.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Only legal move is c6d8 (rook moves to d8). Let's analyze this:\n  - After c6d8, white can play Qb5xd7, winning the exchange (rook for bishop).\n  - Alternatively, white might play Qb5a5, maintaining pressure.\n\n4. Other considerations:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8.\n- White has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous.\n- Black's queen on h3 is not very active currently.\n\nAfter considering all options, c6d8 seems to be the only move. While it doesn't solve all our problems, it at least gets the rook to a more active square and defends the bishop on c6.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc6d8\n```"
