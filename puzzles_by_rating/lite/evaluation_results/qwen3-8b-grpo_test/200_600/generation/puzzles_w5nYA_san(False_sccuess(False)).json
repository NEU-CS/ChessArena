When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (bishop, knight, pawns). Black has a slight lead in development with both bishops and rooks connected.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on c8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White's bishop on d4 is very active, attacking multiple squares.\n- Black's bishop on g4 is putting pressure on f3 and h2 squares.\n- White has the option to castle kingside (KQ in FEN indicates this).\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d4g7: Bishop sacrifice to win the exchange. After ...fxg7, Qd5 wins the exchange back and puts pressure on f7.\n- d4f6: Attacks the pawn on e7 and puts pressure on the king.\n- f1a6: Develops the queen to an active square, putting pressure on f7.\n- e1d2: Gets the king to a safer square and connects rooks.\n- b1d2: Develops the knight and defends e4.\n\nAfter considering all options, d4g7 seems the most promising:\n1. It forces Black to either give up the exchange or allow Qd5 with strong pressure.\n2. Even if Black doesn't take the bishop, we can follow up with Qd5 or castling.\n3. It opens up the f8 square for our queen or rook to attack.\n\nThe move creates immediate threats and forces Black to react to our initiative. Other moves are more passive or don't take advantage of Black's exposed king.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd4g7\n```"
