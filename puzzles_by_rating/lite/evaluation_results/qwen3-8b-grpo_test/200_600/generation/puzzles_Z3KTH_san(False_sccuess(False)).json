When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook on f8, bishop on c7, pawn on g6. White has rook on d1, bishop on d6, pawn on c2, b2, a2. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's rook on f8 is very active, controlling the f-file and putting pressure on the white king.\n- White's bishop on d6 is blocking the rook on d1, but also controlling important diagonals.\n- The pawn structure is locked with pawns on c5 and b5 preventing each other from advancing.\n- White's king is exposed on h1.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e6g8: Bishop takes rook. After ...Rxg8, White can play Rxd8 and is up material. But Black can just move the rook away instead.\n- d6d8: Rook trade. After ...Rxd8, Bxd8 and White is up a bishop. But Black can just move the rook away.\n- d1d5: Rook to d5, putting pressure on the c5 pawn. But Black can just defend with ...Rf7.\n- h1g1: King move to safety. But doesn't address immediate threats.\n- d1g1: Rook to g1, defending the pawn and getting out of potential pins.\n\nAfter considering all options, e6g8 seems the most promising:\n- If Black doesn't take the rook, we can play Rxd8 and be up material.\n- If Black takes the rook with ...Rxg8, we can play Rxd8 and are up a bishop.\n- In both cases, we gain material advantage.\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or don't maximize our material advantage. Therefore, the best move is to take the rook with the bishop.\n\n```\ne6g8\n```"
