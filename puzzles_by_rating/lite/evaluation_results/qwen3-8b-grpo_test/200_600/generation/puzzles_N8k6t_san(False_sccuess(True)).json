When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is on f8, putting pressure on black's king on h8.\n- Black's queen is on h6, defending the king and putting pressure on e3.\n- Black's rook on a8 is not very active.\n- White has a strong knight on d2 controlling key squares.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\nOnly legal move is e8f8 (king moves to f8).\n\n4. Analysis of e8f8:\n- Gets the king to a safer square away from the f8 queen's attack.\n- Connects with the other rook on f8.\n- Prevents any immediate tactics from white.\n\n5. Other considerations:\n- There are no other legal moves, so we must play e8f8.\n- After this move, white may play Qf7 or Qe7, but black can defend accordingly.\n\nSince e8f8 is the only legal move, and it improves king safety and connects the rooks, it's the best move in this position.\n\n```\ne8f8\n```"
