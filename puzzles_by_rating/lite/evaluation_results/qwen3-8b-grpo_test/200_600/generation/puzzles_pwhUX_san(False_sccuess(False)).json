When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety: White's king is exposed on h1. Black's king is on g7, also not very safe.\n\n3. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on e7 is very active, controlling important squares.\n- White's queen on g4 is putting pressure on black's position.\n- The knight on f2 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- The pawn structure is locked with pawns on d5 and c6.\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n- h1g1: Moves the king to a slightly safer square and connects the rooks.\n- f1f2: Moves the rook to f2, defending the knight and potentially putting pressure on black's position.\n\nAfter considering both options:\n- h1g1 seems more prudent, getting the king to a safer square and connecting the rooks. It also prevents black from playing ...Qe5+ in the future.\n- f1f2 is more aggressive but leaves the king exposed and doesn't address the immediate threats.\n\nThe best move is to prioritize king safety and connect the rooks. Therefore, the move is:\n\n```\nh1g1\n```"
