When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook, bishop, pawn. White has rook, bishop, pawn. Material is equal but black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's rook on e8 is very powerful, controlling the e-file and putting pressure on white's king.\n- White's bishop on h6 is blocking the g7 square and not very active otherwise.\n- Black's bishop on e4 is very strong, controlling important diagonals and putting pressure on white's pawns.\n- White's king is exposed on d2 with limited pawn cover.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Rook moves (e8f8, e8d8, etc): Moving the rook to a less active square seems passive. e8e7 looks interesting to double on the e-file.\n- Bishop moves (e4f5, e4f3, etc): e4f5 attacks the g4 pawn but allows white to play g4g5. e4d3 seems to defend c2 square but is passive.\n- Pawn moves (c7c6, b7b6, etc): Pushing pawns seems slow and doesn't address immediate threats.\n\n4. Best move:\ne8e7 seems most promising:\n- It doubles rooks (if we can get another rook to e7)\n- It maintains pressure on the e-file\n- It doesn't allow white to counterattack\n- It keeps options open\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow white to become more active. The rook on e7 would be very powerful, controlling both e and 7th ranks.\n\nAfter considering all options, the most solid move is to keep pressure on the e-file with the rook.\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
