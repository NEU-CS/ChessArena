When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook on a8 and r8, bishop on c8, pawns on c6, e7, f7, g7, h8. White has rook on a1, king on e1, pawns on c3, e4, f4, g2, h2. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White has a strong bishop pair potential (though currently blocked).\n- The e4 pawn is a potential target.\n- White has castling rights (K side) but hasn't castled yet.\n- Black's rooks are not very active currently.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e1g1 (castling): Gets the king to safety and connects rooks. Seems solid.\n- a1a7: Attacks the f7 pawn, but black can just move the pawn.\n- e5e6: Pushing the pawn to open up the position, but it's not immediately threatening.\n- f4f5: Creates a passed pawn but may be premature.\n- e3e4: Pushing the pawn to control more space.\n\nAfter considering all options, castling (e1g1) seems like the most prudent move. It:\n1. Gets the king to a safer square\n2. Connects the rooks\n3. Doesn't allow black to counterattack\n4. Maintains all of white's options\n\nThe other moves either don't improve white's position or could potentially give black counterplay. Castling is a fundamental principle in chess when you have the chance.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to castle kingside.\n\n```\ne1g1\n```"
