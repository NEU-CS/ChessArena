When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, pawns). Black has a slight lead in development with both knights and queen active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on f5, putting pressure on f2 and e3 squares.\n- White's bishop on h5 is very active, attacking f7 and putting pressure on black's king.\n- Black's king is exposed on g7 with limited pawn cover.\n- White has a strong central pawn on d4, but it's somewhat isolated.\n- Both sides have castling rights, but white hasn't castled yet.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- h5g6: Bishop takes pawn, but after ...Qxg6 white loses material.\n- d2e4: Queen trade, but after ...Qxe4 dxe4 opens up the position further.\n- d1g4: Queen to g4, putting pressure on f7 and h6 squares.\n- g1f3: Knight to f3, defending e5 and putting pressure on d4.\n- e1e2: King move to safety.\n- a1c1: Rook lift to c1, connecting rooks and defending d3.\n\nAfter considering all options, d1g4 seems most promising:\n1. It puts immediate pressure on f7 square\n2. If black doesn't defend properly, we can consider Qxf7 or Qxh6\n3. It also prevents black from playing ...Qe7 to defend f5\n4. It maintains our initiative while improving our queen's position\n\nOther moves either don't address black's threats or allow black to consolidate their position. The move d1g4 creates the most problems for black to solve.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd1g4\n```"
