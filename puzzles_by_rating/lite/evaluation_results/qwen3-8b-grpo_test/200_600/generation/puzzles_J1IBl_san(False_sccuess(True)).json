When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is on d6, putting pressure on the white king.\n- White's queen is on h5, controlling important diagonals.\n- Black has a rook on f8 and another on f1 (though the f1 rook is blocked by its own pawn).\n- White's king is on g1, somewhat exposed.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- h2g1: This moves the bishop to g1, blocking the f1 rook. However, after ...Qd6xh2, Black wins the bishop and has a material advantage.\n- c1f1: This moves the rook to f1, attacking the black rook on f1. After ...Rxf1, Qxf1 and White is up a rook.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n- c1f1 is a much better move as it either wins a rook or forces Black to give up their queen. After ...Rxf1, Qxf1 and White is up a rook. If Black doesn't take the rook, we can take the f1 rook next move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play the rook to f1, putting pressure on Black's rook and creating winning opportunities.\n\n```\nc1f1\n```"
