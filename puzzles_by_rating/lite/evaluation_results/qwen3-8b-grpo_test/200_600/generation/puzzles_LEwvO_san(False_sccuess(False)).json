When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, bishop, pawn. Black has queen, two rooks, bishop. Black is up a rook and bishop, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g1. Black's king is on g7, also not very safe.\n\n3. Key observations:\n- Black's queen and rooks are very active, controlling important squares.\n- White's queen is on g4, putting pressure on black's position.\n- The bishop on a7 is not very active currently.\n- Black's bishop on f8 is blocking the rook on e8.\n\n4. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g4g8: Qxg8, but after Rxg8 White is down material and the position is lost.\n- g4c8: Qxc8, but after Rxc8 White is still down material.\n- d2d8: Qxd8, but after Rxd8 White is down material.\n- g4g7: Qxg7+, but after Kxg7 White is down material.\n- g1h1: King move to safety, but doesn't address the material deficit.\n- h2h3: Pawn move to create some counterplay.\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move seems to be g4g8 (Qxg8). While it loses material immediately, it at least forces Black to recapture with the rook, and we can then try to create some counterplay with our remaining pieces. Other moves either lose even more material or don't address the immediate threats.\n\nTherefore, the move is:\n```\ng4g8\n```"
