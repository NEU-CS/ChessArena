When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has bishop, pawn, king, rook. Black has rook, bishop, knight, pawn, king. Black is up a knight.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's knight on g6 is very strong, controlling key squares.\n- White's bishop on c5 is active but potentially trapped.\n- Black's rook on b7 is controlling the b-file.\n- White's king is exposed on f1.\n- The e4 pawn is isolated and could become a target.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Bishop moves: c5f8 (attacking the rook), c5e7 (attacking the knight), c5a7 (attacking the rook). The most promising seems c5f8, putting pressure on the rook.\n- Rook moves: a1a8 (trading rooks), a1a7 (attacking the rook). a1a8 seems passive but could lead to simplification.\n- Pawn moves: e4e5 (advancing the pawn), h2h3 (improving king safety). e4e5 seems too committal.\n\nAfter considering all options, c5f8 seems the most promising:\n- It attacks the black rook on b7\n- If black moves the rook, we can consider activating our rook\n- It doesn't allow black to maintain all their pressure\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or allow black to consolidate their advantage. The bishop is too valuable to just trade off passively.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to put pressure on the rook with the bishop:\n\n```\nc5f8\n```"
