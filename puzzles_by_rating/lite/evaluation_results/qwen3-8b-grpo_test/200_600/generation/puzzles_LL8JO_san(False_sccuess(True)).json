When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on h6, putting pressure on f8 and g7.\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover.\n- The bishop on e4 is very strong, controlling important diagonals.\n- White's knight on e7 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- Only legal move is h8h7 (rook moves to h7).\n\nAnalysis of h8h7:\n- Gets the rook to a more active position\n- Defends the queen on d8\n- Prevents white from playing Qh5+ in the future\n- Doesn't allow white to play Qxf8 immediately\n\nAfter considering all options, h8h7 seems like the most solid move. It improves the rook's position and doesn't allow white to gain any immediate advantages.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh8h7\n```"
