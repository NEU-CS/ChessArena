When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Current position analysis:\n   - Black has a pawn on d5 and king on c4\n   - White has a knight on d3 and king on g2\n   - It's Black's turn to move (b in FEN)\n\n2. Key factors to consider:\n   - The pawn on d5 is isolated and can be captured by the knight\n   - The black king is actively placed in the center\n   - White's knight is well placed to control key squares\n   - The position is likely drawn with correct play\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n   - c4b5: Moves the king towards the pawn but allows Nxb5\n   - c4d4: Moves the king to d4, but white can play Nc5+\n   - c4d3: Moves the king to d3, but white can play Nxe5\n   - c4c3: Moves the king to c3, but white can play Nc5\n   - c4b3: Moves the king to b3, but white can play Nc5\n   - d5d4: Pushes the pawn to d4, but white can play Nxd4\n\nAfter considering all options, d5d4 seems the most resilient:\n- It creates a passed pawn that white must deal with\n- If white takes the pawn with Nxd4, we can play Kxd4 and the position is drawn\n- Other moves either allow white to capture the pawn or lose material\n\nThe best move is to push the pawn and create counterplay.\n\n```\nd5d4\n```"
