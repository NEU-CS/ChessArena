When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has king, bishop, knight, pawn. White has queen, bishop, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d6, putting pressure on black's position.\n- Black's king is exposed on c8.\n- The bishop on e7 is blocking the queen's diagonal.\n- The pawn on f6 is a potential target.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- h8h7: Moves the knight to h7, but doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n- c8b8: Moves the king to b8, getting away from the queen's attacks.\n- e7g6: Moves the bishop to g6, blocking the queen's diagonal and defending f5.\n- d7e8: Moves the bishop to e8, but this seems passive.\n- b5c4: Moves the pawn to c4, but this doesn't address immediate threats.\n- g7g6: Moves the pawn to g6, but this seems passive.\n- f6f5: Moves the pawn to f5, but this opens up the position further.\n\nAfter considering all options, e7g6 seems the most promising:\n- It blocks the queen's diagonal, reducing its activity\n- It defends the f5 square\n- It doesn't allow white to play Qd6-e7 or similar threats\n- It maintains control over key squares\n\nThe other moves either don't address the queen's activity or leave black's position too exposed. Therefore, the best move is to block the queen's diagonal with the bishop.\n\n```\ne7g6\n```"
