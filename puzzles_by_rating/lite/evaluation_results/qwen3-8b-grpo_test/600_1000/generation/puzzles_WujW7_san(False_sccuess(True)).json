When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is on g8, putting pressure on black's king on f8.\n- Black's queen is on a3, not very active currently.\n- Black's rook on f8 is defending the king but is also being attacked by the white queen.\n- White has a knight on f3 controlling important squares.\n- Black's knight on b3 is not very active.\n\n3. Candidate moves:\n- f8g8: Moving the rook to g8. Let's analyze this:\n  - After f8g8, white can play Qxg8, winning the exchange (rook for queen).\n  - Alternatively, white might not take immediately, but black's position would be passive.\n\n4. Other considerations:\n- There are no other legal moves available (only f8g8 is listed).\n- The position seems drawn, but black must avoid any mistakes.\n\nAfter considering all options, f8g8 is the only move available. While it leads to a material loss after Qxg8, it's the only move to make. \n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf8g8\n```"
