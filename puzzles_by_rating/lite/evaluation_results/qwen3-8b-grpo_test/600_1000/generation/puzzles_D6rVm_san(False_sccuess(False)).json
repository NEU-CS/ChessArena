When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn. White has queen, knight, pawn. Black is up a bishop and pawn, which is a significant material advantage.\n\n2. King safety: White's king is exposed on g2. Black's king is on c7, somewhat exposed.\n\n3. Key observations:\n- Black's queen on e8 is very active, controlling important squares.\n- White's queen on d3 is defending the pawn on c3 but not very active otherwise.\n- The knight on f3 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- The pawn on e5 is isolated and could become a target.\n\n4. Candidate moves analysis:\n- f3g5: Attacks the pawn on h7 and puts pressure on the black king. But after ...Qxg6, Black wins material.\n- d3d8: Trades queens. After ...Qxd8, White is down material and the position is lost.\n- e5f6: Captures the pawn, but after ...Qxf6, Black is up even more material.\n- g2g3: Moves the king to a safer square, but doesn't address the material deficit.\n- f1g3: Develops the knight and defends e2, but doesn't change the material situation.\n\nAfter considering all options, the most resilient move seems to be g2g3, getting the king to a slightly safer square and hoping for a mistake. All other moves either lose material immediately or lead to a worse position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to get the king to a safer square and hope for a mistake in the opponent's play.\n\n```\ng2g3\n```"
