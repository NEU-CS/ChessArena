When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's rook on d8 is very active, controlling the d-file and putting pressure on white's pawns.\n- White's rook on h6 is very active, controlling the h-file and putting pressure on black's king.\n- Black's bishop on e3 is blocking the pawn on f2 and controlling important diagonals.\n- White's knight on e4 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- h6h8: Rook trade. After ...Rxh8, white can play Nxg5, but black has ...Bxg5 and the position is drawn.\n- h6h7: Defends g5 square, but doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n- e4f6: Attacks the pawn on g8, but black can just take it back.\n- e4d6: Attacks the rook on d8, but black can just move the rook.\n- g2h3: Moves the pawn to safety, but doesn't address immediate threats.\n\nAfter considering all options, h6h8 seems the most promising:\n- It forces black to either trade rooks or find a defensive move.\n- If ...Rxh8, then Nxg5 wins a pawn and creates threats against black's king.\n- If black doesn't take the rook, white can consider other active moves.\n\nThe move h6h8 leads to the most promising position where white can gain an advantage. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nh6h8\n```"
