When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight, pawn. Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn. Black is up a bishop but down a pawn.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on d5, putting pressure on white's position.\n- White's knight on c5 is very active, attacking multiple squares.\n- Black's king is exposed on g8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White has a passed pawn on a4 that could become dangerous.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c5d7: Attacks the queen and threatens to win it. After Qxd7, exd7 opens up the e-file and white has a material advantage.\n- c5b7: Attacks the pawn on a5, but doesn't seem as promising.\n- d2d5: Trades queens. After Qxd5, Nxd5 and white is up a queen vs bishop.\n- c1c4: Defends the a4 pawn and puts pressure on black's position.\n\nAfter considering all options, c5d7 seems the most promising:\n- It forces black to either give up the queen or allow white to gain material.\n- If black doesn't take the knight, white can simply take the queen next move.\n- Even if black takes the knight, white can recapture with the pawn and be up material.\n\nThe move d2d5 is also interesting as it leads to a queen trade, but c5d7 is more aggressive and keeps more options open.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play the knight to d7, putting maximum pressure on black's position.\n\n```\nc5d7\n```"
