Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on g6 with limited pawn cover.\n- White's rook on e7 is very active, controlling the 7th rank.\n- Black's rook on c3 is blocking the c2 pawn and not very active.\n- White's knight on d4 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- Black's knight on d6 is defending the king but not very active.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Rook moves (e7e8, e7h7, etc): e7e8 looks tempting to deliver checkmate, but after ...Kf7 the rook is trapped. Other rook moves don't seem as promising.\n- Knight moves: d4e6 attacks the knight and puts pressure on the king. d4c6 attacks the rook but allows ...Rxc6.\n- Bishop moves: b1g6 is a interesting sacrifice to open up the position.\n- Pawn moves: g4g5 could be considered to create threats.\n\nAfter considering all options, d4e6 seems the most promising:\n- It attacks the black knight on d6\n- If Black moves the knight, we can follow up with Rook moves or Bishop sacrifices\n- It maintains pressure on the black king\n\nThe move d4e6 creates immediate threats and forces Black to react. Other moves either don't create enough pressure or allow Black to consolidate their position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd4e6\n```"

King is on h2.\n- Black has a rook on c3, rook on d2, pawn on g7 and a6. King is on g6.\n- White to move. Only two legal moves: h2h1 and h2g1.\n\nLet's evaluate both options:\n\n1. h2h1:\n   - Moves the king to h1.\n   - Black can respond with ...Rd1, attacking the rook on f8 and putting pressure on the king.\n   - Or ...Rc1, doubling rooks and increasing pressure.\n   - White's position becomes very passive and defensive.\n\n2. h2g1:\n   - Moves the king to g1.\n   - Black can respond with ...Rd1, similar to above.\n   - Or ...Rc1.\n   - However, the king is slightly more active on g1, potentially able to help defend the pawn structure.\n\nAfter considering both moves, h2g1 seems slightly better because:\n- The king is more active on g1\n- It doesn't allow black to immediately double rooks with threats\n- It keeps some defensive options open\n\nThe position is very difficult for white, but h2g1 offers the most resistance.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh2g1\n```"
