When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight. White has queen, rook, knight. Black is up a bishop but white has a passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous.\n\n2. Key observations:\n- White's queen is very active on c7, putting pressure on black's position.\n- Black's queen on b2 is somewhat exposed and could be challenged.\n- The knight on h6 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- The bishop on e7 is blocking the rook on d8.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d8e8: Rook lift to e8, defending the queen and connecting with the other rook. Seems solid.\n- b2b6: Queen trade, but after Qxb6 axb6 white is up a queen.\n- h6f7: Knight to f7, attacking the queen. But white can just move the queen.\n- e7d6: Bishop to d6, blocking the pawn and defending the queen.\n- f6f5: Knight to f5, but this seems passive.\n\nAfter considering all options, d8e8 seems like the most solid move:\n- Defends the queen\n- Connects the rooks\n- Doesn't allow white to play any dangerous tactics\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nThe other options either don't address white's active queen or allow white to gain an advantage. Therefore, the best move is to connect the rooks and defend the queen.\n\n```\nd8e8\n```"
