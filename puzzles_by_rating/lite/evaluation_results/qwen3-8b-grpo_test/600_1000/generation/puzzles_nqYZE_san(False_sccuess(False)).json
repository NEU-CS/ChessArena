When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on f6, putting pressure on white's position.\n- White's queen is on d4, defending the pawn on c4 and putting pressure on f6.\n- Black's rook on e8 is not very active currently.\n- White's knight on f3 is well placed, controlling key squares.\n- The bishop on f5 is blocking the rook on e8.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e2e7: Rook lift to e7, defending the queen and putting pressure on the pawn structure.\n- f6d8: Queen trade, but after Qxd8 Rfxd8 white is up a queen.\n- f5c8: Bishop to c8, but this seems passive.\n- e8f8: Rook to f8, defending the queen and connecting with the other rook.\n- f6e7: Queen to e7, defending the rook and putting pressure on the pawn.\n\nAfter considering all options, e2e7 seems the most promising:\n- It defends the queen\n- It puts pressure on the pawn on d6\n- It prevents white from playing Qe4 or Qe5\n- It maintains control over the e-file\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow white to become too active. The move e2e7 seems to solidify our position while maintaining all our options.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne2e7\n```"
