When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is on g7, putting pressure on the white king.\n- White's queen is on f4, controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's knight on e5 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- White's bishop on d3 is blocked by its own pawn on c2.\n- The pawn structure is locked with pawns on e4 and e5.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- f4f8: Qxf8, but after ...Qxf8, White is down material.\n- f4f7: Qxf7, but after ...Qxf7, White is down material.\n- f4h6: Qxh6, but after ...Qxh6, White is down material.\n- e2d4: Nxd4, but after ...Qxd4, White is down material.\n- d3a6: Bxa6, but after ...Qxa6, White is down material.\n- c1d2: Bxd2, but after ...Qxd2, White is down material.\n- g3g4: Pushing the pawn, but it doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n\nAfter considering all the options, the best move seems to be f4f8. Although it leads to a material exchange, it at least forces Black to respond to the threat of Qxf8. Other moves either lose material immediately or don't address Black's threats.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf4f8\n```"
