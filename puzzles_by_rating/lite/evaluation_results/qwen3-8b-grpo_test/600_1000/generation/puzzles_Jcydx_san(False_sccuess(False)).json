When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, pawns). Black has a slight lead in development with both bishops active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is on d3, putting pressure on f5 and e3 squares.\n- Black's queen is on d8, somewhat exposed.\n- Both sides have castled positions, but Black's king is slightly more exposed.\n- The f5 bishop is very active, controlling important diagonals.\n- The e5 bishop is also well placed, controlling the e5-h2 diagonal.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e5h8: Trading bishops. After Qxh8, Black can play Qxh8 and White must recapture, leading to a simplified position. This seems passive but safe.\n- e5g7: Defends f5 and puts pressure on h6. However, White can just ignore it for now.\n- d8e7: Gets the queen to a more active position and defends f5.\n- f5c8: Trades off the active bishop, but after Qxc8, Black is down a bishop.\n- e8e7: Moves the king to a safer square and connects the rooks.\n\nAfter considering all options, d8e7 seems the most promising:\n1. Gets the queen to a more active position\n2. Defends the f5 bishop\n3. Doesn't allow White to maintain too much pressure\n4. Keeps options open\n\nThe move also prevents White from playing Qe3 or Qf4 in the future. Other moves either seem too passive or don't improve Black's position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nd8e7\n```"
