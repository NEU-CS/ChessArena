When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, bishop, pawn. Black has rook, bishop, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on h8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White's queen is very active on b6, putting pressure on black's position.\n- Black has a rook on d8 controlling the d-file and another on e1.\n- White's bishop on g2 is not very active currently.\n- Black's bishop on g6 is blocking the pawn on g5.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- b6b8: Qxb8, but after Rxb8 White doesn't have enough compensation.\n- b6c7: Qc7, threatening to take the rook on d8. Black would likely play Rd7 or Rd7.\n- b6a7: Qa7, but this seems less promising.\n- g2a8: Bxa8, but this just trades off pieces and doesn't improve our position.\n- c3d4: Pawn exchange, but this opens up the position further.\n- g4g5: Pushing the pawn to challenge black's bishop.\n\nAfter considering all options, b6c7 seems the most promising:\n- It directly attacks the black rook on d8\n- If Black moves the rook, we can consider increasing pressure on the king\n- It maintains control over key squares\n- Other moves either don't create immediate threats or allow Black to consolidate their position.\n\nThe move b6c7 creates the most problems for Black to solve while improving our piece activity. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nb6c7\n```"
