When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has king, rook, bishop. White has king, rook, pawn. Material is equal but black's pieces are more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's rook on a7 is very powerful, controlling the a-file and putting pressure on black's king.\n- Black's rook on c4 is very active, attacking multiple squares.\n- Black's bishop on f6 is controlling important diagonals.\n- White's pawn on c3 is blocking the rook's control of c4.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Rook moves (c4c5, c4h4, etc): c4c5 seems to defend the bishop and put pressure on white's pawn. c4h4 could be interesting to double on the h-file.\n- King moves (g8h8, g8f8): moving the king to safety is important but doesn't address immediate threats.\n- Bishop moves (f6d8, f6e7): moving the bishop to a more active square or to defend.\n- Pawn moves (h7h6, g7g6): not very urgent.\n\nAfter considering all options, c4c5 seems like the most promising move:\n1. It defends the bishop on f6\n2. It puts pressure on white's pawn on c3\n3. It prevents white from playing Ra7-c7 to attack the bishop\n4. It maintains control over the c-file\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or allow white to maintain too much control. Therefore, the best move is to play the rook to c5, putting pressure on white's position.\n\n```\nc4c5\n```"
