When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on e6, putting pressure on multiple squares.\n- Black's rook on e8 is controlling the e-file.\n- White's queen is on d4, defending f2 and putting pressure on e5.\n- The knight on g3 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- The pawn structure is locked in the center with pawns on d5 and e5.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- f1g1: Moves the rook to g1. This would:\n  * Defend the f2 pawn\n  * Potentially coordinate with the queen\n  * But doesn't address immediate threats\n- f2g3: Moves the pawn to g3. This would:\n  * Attack the knight on g3\n  * Open up the f-file\n  * But might expose the queen to counterattacks\n\nAfter considering both options, f1g1 seems more solid:\n- It improves the rook's position\n- It doesn't allow Black to play any dangerous tactics\n- It maintains control over key squares\n\nThe move f2g3 seems riskier as it could open up the position when we're slightly worse.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play the more solid move that improves our piece coordination while maintaining defensive stability.\n\n```\nf1g1\n```"
