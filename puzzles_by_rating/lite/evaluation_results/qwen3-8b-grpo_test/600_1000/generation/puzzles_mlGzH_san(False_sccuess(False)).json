When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d4, putting pressure on black's position.\n- Black's queen is on d8, somewhat exposed.\n- Black's bishop on d6 is very strong, controlling important diagonals.\n- White's knight on f3 is well placed, defending key squares.\n- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e8e7: Gets the queen to a safer square and connects the rooks. But allows Qd4-e5+ in some lines.\n- d8e7: Trades queens. After Qxe7, Rxe7 and white is up a queen. Not great.\n- d6f8: Bishop to f8, defending the queen and putting pressure on g7.\n- g4c8: Bishop to c8, defending the queen and controlling the diagonal.\n- b8c8: Rook to c8, defending the queen and controlling the c-file.\n\nAfter considering all options, e8e7 seems the most solid move:\n- Gets the queen to a safer square\n- Connects the rooks\n- Prevents white from playing Qe5+ in the future\n- Maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves either don't address white's active queen or allow white to gain an advantage. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne8e7\n```"
