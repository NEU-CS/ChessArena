When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, bishop, pawn. White has queen, bishop, pawn. Material is equal but black's queen is more active.\n\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen is on f3, putting pressure on f2 and e3.\n- White's queen is on e2, defending f2 but not very active otherwise.\n- Black's bishop on e5 is controlling important diagonals.\n- White's bishop on e3 is blocked by its own pawn on c3.\n- The pawn structure is locked with pawns on e5 and c5.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e3h6: Blocking the queen and attacking it. After Qxh6, Qxh6 gxh6 and white is up a queen. But black can just move the queen away.\n- e2a6: Trading queens. After Qxa6, Qxa6 bxa6 and white is up a queen. But black can just move the queen away.\n- d1d8: Rook lift to d8, putting pressure on the black king. But black can just move the queen away.\n- e3g5: Blocking the bishop and attacking it. After Bxg5, Qxg5 and white is up a bishop.\n- g1h1: Moving the king to safety.\n\nAfter considering all options, e3h6 seems the most promising:\n- It forces black to either give up the queen or allow us to win material.\n- If black moves the queen away, we can consider trading queens and being up material.\n- It also prevents black from playing Qf2+ in the future.\n\nThe move that wins material immediately is e3h6, forcing Qxh6 gxh6 and we're up a queen.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne3h6\n```"
