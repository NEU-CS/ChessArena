When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has Rook, Rook, Knight, 3 pawns. Black has Rook, Rook, Bishop, 2 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on d8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White's rook on f7 is very active, controlling the 7th rank.\n- White's rook on e4 is also very active, controlling the e-file.\n- Black's bishop on b8 is not very active.\n- Black's pawn on g4 is isolated and could become a target.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Rook moves (f7f8, e4e8): f7f8 looks tempting to deliver checkmate, but after ...Kd7 it's not immediate. e4e8 is also interesting to put pressure on the black king.\n- Knight moves (b3c5, b3a5, etc): b3c5 could be considered to attack the pawn on d7.\n- King safety moves (g1h2, etc): Not urgent as the king is relatively safe.\n\nAfter considering all options, f7f8 seems the most promising:\n- It directly attacks the black king and forces Black to react.\n- If Black plays ...Kd7, we can follow up with e4e7, creating a mating net.\n- If Black doesn't take the rook, we can consider capturing the pawn on g4 next.\n\nThe move e4e8 is also strong, but f7f8 is more direct and creates immediate threats.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play the most forcing and aggressive move:\n\n```\nf7f8\n```"
