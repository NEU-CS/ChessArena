When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on b8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White's queen is very active on g8, putting pressure on black's position.\n- Black's queen is on a4, not very active currently.\n- White has a rook on h1 that can be activated.\n- The e5 pawn is isolated and could become a target.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Queen moves (g8h8, g8f8, etc): g8h8 looks tempting to deliver checkmate, but black can just take the queen with ...Qxh4.\n- Rook moves (h1g1, h1f1, etc): h1g1 seems to activate the rook and put pressure on the g-file.\n- Pawn moves (e5e6, h2h3, etc): e5e6 could be considered to open up the position further.\n\nAfter considering all options, h1g1 seems the most promising:\n- It activates the rook and puts pressure on the g-file.\n- It doesn't allow black to counterattack or defend comfortably.\n- It maintains all of white's options while improving piece coordination.\n\nThe move g8h8 is tempting but after ...Qxh4, black is fine. Other queen moves don't seem as strong. Rook activation with h1g1 seems like the most solid move that improves our position while limiting black's options.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh1g1\n```"
