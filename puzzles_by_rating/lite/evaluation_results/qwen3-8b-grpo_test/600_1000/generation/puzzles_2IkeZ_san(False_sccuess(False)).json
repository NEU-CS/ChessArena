When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Current position analysis:\n   - White has a strong bishop on c4, putting pressure on f7 and controlling important diagonals.\n   - White's queen is on f3, eyeing the f7 square and potentially participating in an attack.\n   - Black's king is still in the center (e8) and hasn't castled yet.\n   - Black's pawn structure is solid but somewhat passive.\n\n2. Candidate moves evaluation:\n   - g8f6: Developing the knight to a good square, defending e4 and putting pressure on c3. Also helps with king safety.\n   - f8g7: Developing the bishop and defending e5. But seems a bit passive.\n   - b8c6: Developing the knight and defending d4. But allows White to play d3 and gain control of the center.\n   - a8a7: Rook lift to prepare castling. But doesn't address immediate concerns.\n   - e7e6: Pushing the pawn to challenge White's bishop. But opens up the position further.\n\n3. Best move considerations:\n   - g8f6 seems most promising as it:\n     * Develops a piece to an active square\n     * Defends the e4 square\n     * Helps with king safety\n     * Doesn't allow White to maintain too much pressure\n   - Other moves either don't develop pieces or allow White to maintain the initiative.\n\n4. Potential threats:\n   - White could play Qd5 or Qe4 next, putting pressure on f7.\n   - We need to address these threats while developing our pieces.\n\nAfter considering all options, the most solid and active move is to develop the knight to f6.\n\n```\ng8f6\n```"
