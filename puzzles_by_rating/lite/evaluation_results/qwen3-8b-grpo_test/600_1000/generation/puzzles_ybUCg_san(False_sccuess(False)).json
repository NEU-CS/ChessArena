When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. King safety: Black's king is exposed on g5. White's king is on g3, also not very safe.\n\n3. Pawn structure: Black's pawns are isolated and not very advanced. White's pawns are more connected but also not very advanced.\n\n4. Candidate moves analysis:\n- f6g8: Knight to g8. Not very active, doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n- f6e8: Knight to e8. Similar to g8, not very promising.\n- f6h7: Knight to h7. Attacks g5 but doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n- f6d7: Knight to d7. Attacks c5 pawn but allows white to play c4-c5.\n- f6h5: Knight to h5. Attacks g3 but doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n- f6d5: Knight to d5. Attacks c3 and e3 squares but doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n- f6g4: Knight to g4. Attacks f2 and h2 but doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n- f6e4: Knight to e4. Attacks d2 and f2 but doesn't seem to create immediate threats.\n- g5h6: King to h6. Gets away from the center but doesn't seem to improve position.\n- b6b5: Pawn to b5. Creates a passed pawn but allows white to play c4-c5.\n- a6a5: Pawn to a5. Not very active.\n\nAfter considering all options, b6b5 seems the most promising move. It creates a passed pawn that could potentially advance. While it allows white to play c4-c5, it also opens up the position and creates counterplay.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to create a passed pawn with:\n\n```\nb6b5\n```"
