When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is on a4, putting pressure on the white king.\n- White's queen is on f3, controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's rook on c8 is very active, controlling the c-file.\n- White's rook on e1 is not very active currently.\n- The pawn structure is locked with pawns on g4 and h4.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e7e8: Rook trade. After ...Qxe8, Qxe8 Rxe8 and white is down material. Not good.\n- f3a8: Queen trade. After ...Qxa8, white is down material. Not good.\n- e1e6: Rook lift to e6. Defends g6 square and puts pressure on black's pawns.\n- f3f7: Queen to f7, defending g5 and putting pressure on black's position.\n- e1e5: Rook to e5, defending the queen and controlling more squares.\n\nAfter considering all options, e1e6 seems most promising:\n- It activates the rook\n- Defends the g6 square\n- Put pressure on black's pawns\n- Doesn't allow black to play ...Qb4+ or similar checks\n\nThe move f3f7 is also interesting to defend g5 and put pressure on black's position, but e1e6 seems more solid.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the best move is to activate the rook to e6.\n\n```\ne1e6\n```"
