When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's rook on e8 is very active, controlling the e-file and putting pressure on white's pawns.\n- White's rook on h7 is currently the only active piece.\n- Black's king is exposed on f5.\n- White has a passed pawn on c4 that could become dangerous.\n- Black's pawn on h4 is isolated and could be a target.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- h7h8: Rook trade. After ...Rxh8, Kxh8 and white is up a rook. But black can play ...Rf8 instead, keeping pressure.\n- h7g7: Defends g6 square, but doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n- h5h6: Pushing the pawn to create threats, but black can just take it.\n- b3b4: Pushing the c-pawn to create a passed pawn.\n- g2g3: Defends the pawn and prevents black from playing ...h3.\n- a2a3: Improves the pawn structure but doesn't seem urgent.\n\nAfter considering all options, h7h8 seems the most promising:\n- If black takes the rook with ...Rxh8, we play Kxh8 and are up a rook.\n- If black doesn't take, we can consider doubling rooks or improving our position.\n\nThe move h7h8 forces black to give up their active rook or face material loss. This seems like the most direct way to gain an advantage.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh7h8\n```"
