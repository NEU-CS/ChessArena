When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop, pawn. White has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on g3, putting pressure on multiple squares.\n- White's king is exposed on g1 with limited pawn cover.\n- The bishop on b5 is very powerful, controlling important diagonals.\n- The knight on f3 is well placed, defending key squares.\n- The pawn on d4 is isolated and could become a target.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- b5e8: Bishop to e8, attacking the queen. After Qxe8, Nxe8 and White is up a bishop. But Black can just move the queen away.\n- f3g5: Knight to g5, attacking the queen. Qxg5 and White is down a pawn.\n- e3f5: Knight to f5, defending d4 and putting pressure on g7.\n- d2a5: Rook to a5, defending the bishop and putting pressure on the queenside.\n- g1f1: King move to safety.\n\nAfter considering all options, b5e8 seems most promising:\n- It forces Black to either give up the queen or allow us to win material.\n- Even if Black just moves the queen, we can consider following up with Nxe8 or other active moves.\n- It's the most direct way to challenge Black's most powerful piece.\n\nOther moves either don't address the queen's activity or allow Black to maintain pressure. Therefore, the best move is to challenge the queen with the bishop.\n\n```\nb5e8\n```"
