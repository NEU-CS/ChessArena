When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, bishop, knight, pawns. Black has queen, bishop, rook, pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on e7, putting pressure on f7 and g6 squares.\n- White's queen is on e5, controlling important diagonals.\n- The bishop on f7 is very active, attacking black's queen and controlling key squares.\n- Black's king is exposed on f8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White has a knight on g5 that can jump into strong squares.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- f7g8: Bishop takes rook, but after ...Qxg5 White loses material.\n- f7e8: Bishop takes queen, but after ...Qxe8 White is down material.\n- g5h7: Knight to h7, threatening to fork the queen and rook.\n- e5g7: Queen to g7, putting pressure on the black king.\n- e5e7: Queen exchange, but this would be too passive.\n- b1c3: Developing the knight, but doesn't address immediate threats.\n\nAfter considering all options, g5h7 seems the most promising:\n- It threatens to fork the queen and rook with Nh7-f6+\n- If Black doesn't defend properly, we can win material\n- It also opens up possibilities to attack the black king\n\nThe move e5g7 is also interesting, putting direct pressure on the king, but after ...Qxg7 we don't have a immediate follow-up.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most aggressive and promising move is:\n\n```\ng5h7\n```"
