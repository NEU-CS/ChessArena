When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop. White has queen, rook, bishop. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d1, controlling important squares.\n- Black's queen is on f6, putting pressure on f2 and e3 squares.\n- The bishop on f5 is very strong, controlling important diagonals.\n- The pawn structure is locked in the center with d5 vs d4.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- f6d8: Queen trade. After Qxd8, Rfxd8 and White is fine. Not great.\n- f6e7: Defends the bishop and puts pressure on f2.\n- f5c8: Bishop trade. After Bxc8, Qxc8 and White is fine.\n- f5d7: Defends the queen and puts pressure on e6.\n- a8e8: Rook lift to e8, defending the queen and controlling the e-file.\n- f8e8: Rook lift to e8, similar idea.\n\nAfter considering all options, f6e7 seems most promising:\n- It defends the bishop on f5\n- It puts pressure on f2 square\n- It doesn't allow White to play Qe2 or similar active moves\n- It maintains control over the center\n\nOther moves either don't address White's active queen or allow White to gain an advantage. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\nf6e7\n```"
