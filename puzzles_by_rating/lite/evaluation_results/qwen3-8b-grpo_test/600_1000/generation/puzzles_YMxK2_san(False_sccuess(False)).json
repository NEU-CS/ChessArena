When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, pawns). Black has a slight lead in development with both knights active and bishop on b4.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is on d3, potentially exposed\n- Black's king is still in the center (e8)\n- Both sides have castling rights\n- The e5 pawn is isolated and could become a target\n- Black's bishop on b4 is very active, putting pressure on f8\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e8g8 (castling): Gets the king to safety and connects rooks\n- e8f8: King move to f8, but doesn't seem as safe\n- d8e7: Queen trade, but after Qxe7 Nxe7 White is fine\n- b4f8: Bishop trade, but after Bxf8 Qxf8 White is fine\n- f6d5: Knight to d5, attacking e3 and putting pressure on e5\n- g6e7: Knight to e7, defending f5 and putting pressure on d5\n\nAfter considering all options, castling (e8g8) seems most prudent:\n1. Gets the king to safety\n2. Connects the rooks\n3. Doesn't allow White to gain any initiative\n4. Maintains all of Black's options\n\nThe other moves either don't address the king safety or allow White to gain an advantage. Therefore, the best move is to castle.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
