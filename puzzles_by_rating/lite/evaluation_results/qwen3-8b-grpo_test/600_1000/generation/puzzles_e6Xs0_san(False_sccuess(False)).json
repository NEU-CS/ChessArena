When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is on d1, controlling the a4-e8 diagonal and putting pressure on white's king.\n- White's rook on e4 is very active, controlling the e-file and putting pressure on black's pawns.\n- Black's king is on g6, somewhat exposed.\n- White's king is on g3, also exposed.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e4e8: Rook trade. After Qxe8, Qxe8 Rxe8 and white is up a rook. But black can play Qxe8 and then Qxe8 Rxe8 and white is up a rook. This seems winning.\n- e4e7: Attacks the pawn on g5. But after Qxe7, white loses material.\n- e4e6: Attacks the pawn on g4. But after Qxe6, white loses material.\n- e4e5: Doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n- e4h4: Attacks the pawn on g5. But after Qxh4, white loses material.\n- e4g4: Attacks the pawn on g5. But after Qxg4, white loses material.\n- a5a6: Pushes the pawn. But after Qxa6, white loses material.\n- g3g4: Moves the king. But after Qxg4, white loses material.\n\nAfter considering all the options, e4e8 seems to be the best move. It forces a rook trade and leaves white up a rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne4e8\n```"
