When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, bishop, rook, pawn. White has queen, bishop, knight, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on e5 is very strong, attacking multiple squares.\n- Black's queen on g6 is putting pressure on white's position.\n- Black's king is exposed on d8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White has a bishop on c3 controlling important diagonals.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g6e8: Queen trade. After Qxe8, Black can recapture with the bishop or pawn. This would relieve pressure but give White the initiative.\n- g6f7: Defends the bishop on c8 and puts pressure on e6 square.\n- f8e7: Develops the bishop and connects the rooks.\n- d8e8: King move to a safer square.\n- f5e4: Pawn exchange to challenge White's knight.\n\nAfter considering these options, f8e7 seems most promising:\n1. Develops the bishop to a good diagonal\n2. Connects the rooks\n3. Doesn't allow White to maintain too much pressure\n4. Keeps options open\n\nThe move g6f7 is also interesting to defend the bishop and put pressure on e6, but f8e7 seems more solid.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to develop the bishop and connect the rooks:\n\n```\nf8e7\n```"
