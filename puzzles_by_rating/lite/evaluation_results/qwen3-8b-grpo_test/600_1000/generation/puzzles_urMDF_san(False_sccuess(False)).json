When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn. Black has queen, rook, bishop, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on g4, putting pressure on g2 and h3 squares.\n- White's queen is on d2, controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's bishop on h3 is very active, controlling the a8-h1 diagonal.\n- White's knight on g5 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- The pawn structure is locked in the center with d5 and e6 pawns.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g5h7: Knight check, but after ...Qxh7 White doesn't have a great follow-up.\n- g5f7: Knight to f7, blocking the queen and attacking e5.\n- d5b7: Bishop to b7, attacking the queen and putting pressure on f3.\n- d2a5: Queen to a5, increasing pressure on the queenside.\n- f1e1: Rook to e1, defending e2 and putting pressure on e6.\n\nAfter considering all options, d5b7 seems most promising:\n1. It attacks the black queen, forcing it to move or be exchanged.\n2. If ...Qxb7, then Qxb7 and White is up a bishop.\n3. If ...Qd6, then Qe2 defends and White has a strong position.\n4. It also opens up possibilities for the rook on f1 to become more active.\n\nOther moves either don't address the immediate threats or don't improve White's position as much. Therefore, the best move is to play the bishop to b7, putting pressure on Black's queen.\n\n```\nd5b7\n```"
