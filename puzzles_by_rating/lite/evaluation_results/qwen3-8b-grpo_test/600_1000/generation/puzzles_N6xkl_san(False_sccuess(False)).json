When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, bishop, pawn. Black has queen, rook, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on g5, putting pressure on the white king.\n- White's rook on f7 is very active, controlling the 7th rank.\n- Black's king is on c8, somewhat exposed.\n- White has a passed pawn on d4 that could become dangerous.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Rook moves (f7f8, f7h7, etc): f7f8 looks tempting to deliver checkmate, but after ...Qxf8, White doesn't have enough compensation. Other rook moves don't seem as promising.\n- Bishop moves (e5h8, e5b8, etc): e5h8 is a interesting sacrifice to expose the black king, but after ...Qxh8, White doesn't have a clear follow-up.\n- Queen moves (e2h5, e2g4, etc): e2h5 seems to defend the rook while putting pressure on the black queen.\n- Pawn moves (h2h3, g3g4): h2h3 seems passive but safe.\n\nAfter considering all options, e2h5 seems like the most solid move:\n- It defends the rook on f7\n- It puts pressure on Black's queen\n- It doesn't allow Black to counterattack\n- It maintains all of White's options\n\nThe move e2h5 seems to be the most prudent choice that doesn't allow Black to equalize or gain an advantage.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne2h5\n```"
