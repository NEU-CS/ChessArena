When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop, pawn. White has queen, rook, knight, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on e8 with limited pawn cover.\n- White has a strong knight on e4 controlling important squares.\n- Black's queen on e7 is putting pressure on white's position.\n- Both sides have castling rights but neither has castled yet.\n- The d5 bishop is very active, controlling important diagonals.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e8g8 (castling): Gets the king to safety and connects the rooks. Seems solid.\n- e7f8: Defends the king and connects with the rook. But seems passive.\n- d5c6: Attacks the pawn on b5 and puts pressure on the queen.\n- f5e4: Capturing the knight. But after Qxe4, black's position becomes loose.\n- e7h4: Queen trade. After Qxh4, black is down material.\n\n4. Best move:\nCastling (e8g8) seems like the most prudent move. It:\n- Gets the king to safety\n- Connects the rooks\n- Doesn't allow white to play aggressively\n- Maintains all of black's options\n\nOther moves either don't address the king safety or give white counterplay. The position is complex but castling is the most solid move.\n\nAfter considering all options, the best move is to castle.\n\n```\ne8g8\n```"
