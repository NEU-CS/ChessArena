When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight, 3 pawns. Black has queen, rook, 3 pawns. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on a5, putting pressure on the a4 pawn.\n- White's queen is on g4, controlling important diagonals.\n- The knight on e7 is very active, attacking multiple squares.\n- Black's king is on h8, somewhat exposed.\n- White has a passed pawn on e4 that could become dangerous.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e7g8: Nigh check, but after ...Qxg8 White doesn't have a immediate follow-up.\n- e7c8: Nigh check, but after ...Qxc8 White loses material.\n- g4c8: Queen trade, but after ...Qxc8 White is down material.\n- g4g7: Defends f5 square and puts pressure on black's pawns.\n- g4d7: Attacks the pawn on d6 and puts pressure on the queen.\n- b7b8: Rook lift to the 8th rank, but doesn't seem immediately threatening.\n\nAfter considering all options, g4d7 seems the most promising:\n- It attacks the pawn on d6 which is only defended by the queen.\n- If Black defends with ...Qe7, we can play Qxe7 and after ...Rxe7, Nxe6 and White is winning.\n- If Black doesn't defend, we can take the pawn on d6 next move.\n\nThe move also prevents Black from playing ...Qb5+ in the future. Other moves either don't improve our position or allow Black to consolidate.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng4d7\n```"
