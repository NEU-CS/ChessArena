When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop. White has queen, rook. Black is up a bishop but has a weak pawn structure.\n\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's queen is very active on c4, putting pressure on multiple squares.\n- White's queen is on e3, defending f2 and putting pressure on black's pawns.\n- Black's rook on e6 is controlling the e-file but can be challenged.\n- White's king is somewhat exposed on g1.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e3a7: Qa7 attacks the rook on e6 and puts pressure on the black king. After ...Rd8, Qxd8 wins the exchange.\n- e3h6: Qh6 attacks the pawn on g7. But after ...gxh6, White doesn't have enough compensation.\n- d1d3: Rook lift to d3, defending f3 and putting pressure on the queen. But Black can just move the queen.\n- g1h2: King move to safety. But doesn't address immediate threats.\n- b4b5: Pushing the pawn to create counterplay. But Black can just take it with the queen.\n\nAfter considering all options, e3a7 seems the most promising:\n- It attacks the rook on e6, forcing Black to either move it or defend it.\n- If Black moves the rook, we can consider winning it back or improving our position.\n- If Black doesn't move the rook, we can take it next move, winning the exchange.\n\nThe move also prevents Black from playing ...Qb4+ in the future, which would be very dangerous.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to put pressure on the rook with the queen:\n\n```\ne3a7\n```"
