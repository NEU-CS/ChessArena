When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's queen is on f2, putting pressure on f2 and controlling important squares.\n- White's queen is on g4, attacking the pawn on c8 and putting pressure on the black king.\n- The bishop on g5 is very active, controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed.\n- White has a rook on e1 and another on g1.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d2d1: Moves the queen to d1. This would defend the pawn on c2 and potentially coordinate with the rook on e1. However, it doesn't address the immediate threats.\n- d2c1: Moves the queen to c1. This would defend the pawn on a2 and put pressure on the black queen. But it seems a bit passive.\n- g4e2: Moves the queen to e2. This would attack the pawn on f3 and put pressure on the black queen. It also opens up the possibility of a discovered attack with the bishop on g5.\n- e1e2: Moves the rook to e2. This would defend the queen and put pressure on the black queen. It also helps to control the e-file.\n\nAfter considering all the options, g4e2 seems to be the most promising move. It attacks the pawn on f3, puts pressure on the black queen, and opens up the possibility of a discovered attack with the bishop on g5. It also helps to control the e-file and potentially coordinate with the other rook.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng4e2\n```"
