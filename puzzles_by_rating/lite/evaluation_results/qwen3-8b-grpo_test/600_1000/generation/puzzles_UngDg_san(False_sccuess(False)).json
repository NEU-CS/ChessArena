When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Current position analysis:\n   - White has king at d5 and pawns at d3 and g3\n   - Black has king at f5 and pawn at g4\n   - It's White's turn to move (57th move)\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - Both sides have only kings and pawns left\n   - The g4 pawn is passed but blocked by g3\n   - The d3 pawn is blocked by the black king\n   - The position is a race to promote pawns or stop the opponent's pawn\n\n3. Candidate move analysis:\n   - d5d6: Moves king towards black's pawn but allows ...Kf4 attacking both pawns\n   - d5c6: Moves king to c6, but doesn't seem to accomplish much\n   - d5c5: Moves king to c5, but doesn't help stop either pawn\n   - d5c4: Moves king to c4, but allows ...Kf4 attacking both pawns\n   - d3d4: Advances the d-pawn, creating a passed pawn\n\n4. Best move reasoning:\n   - d3d4 seems most promising as it creates a passed pawn that Black must deal with\n   - After d3d4, Black cannot stop both pawns (g4 and d4)\n   - If Black tries to stop the d-pawn, the g-pawn will queen\n   - If Black tries to stop the g-pawn, the d-pawn will queen\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - d3d4 creates a decisive passed pawn that Black cannot stop\n   - Other moves allow Black to coordinate and stop both pawns\n\nTherefore, the best move is to advance the d-pawn and create a passed pawn.\n\n```\nd3d4\n```"
