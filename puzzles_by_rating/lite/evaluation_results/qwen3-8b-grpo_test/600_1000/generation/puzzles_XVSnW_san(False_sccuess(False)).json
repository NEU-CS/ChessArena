When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop, pawn. White has queen, knight, rook, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on f4, putting pressure on f2 and e3.\n- White's queen is on e3, defending f2 and putting pressure on f4.\n- Black's rook on f6 is very active, controlling the f-file.\n- White's knight on c5 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- Black's bishop on e4 is blocking the queen's defense of f2.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c5d7: Attacks the rook on f6 and threatens to win material. After ...Rxd7, Qxd7 and White is up a piece.\n- e3h6: Trades queens, but after ...Qxh6, White is down material.\n- e3f4: Blocks the queen and defends f2, but allows ...Qxf4.\n- g1f1: Gets the king to safety and connects rooks.\n- c1c2: Defends f5 and prepares to double rooks.\n\nAfter considering all options, c5d7 seems the most promising:\n- It directly attacks the rook on f6\n- If Black moves the rook, we can win it back\n- If Black doesn't move the rook, we can take it next move\n- It doesn't allow Black to maintain material advantage\n\nOther moves either don't address Black's active pieces or allow Black to maintain pressure. The move c5d7 creates immediate threats that Black must respond to.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc5d7\n```"
