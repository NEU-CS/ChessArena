When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has rook on b8, rook on g3, pawn on e4, pawn on f5, pawn on g6. White has bishop on b3, knight on b4, pawn on a4, pawn on g2, rook on e2, king on b2. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key observations:\n- Black's king is exposed on e5\n- White's rook on e2 is very active, controlling the e-file\n- Black's rook on g3 is putting pressure on the g2 pawn\n- The e4 pawn is a potential target\n- White's bishop on b3 is controlling important diagonals\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Rook moves (b8h8, b8g8, etc): Moving the b8 rook to a more active square. b8e8 seems interesting to double rooks.\n- Rook g3 moves: g3g5 could be considered to put more pressure on the g2 pawn.\n- Pawn moves: e4e3 to challenge white's control of e3 square.\n- King moves: e5f6 to get the king to a safer square.\n\nAfter considering all options, b8e8 seems the most promising:\n- It doubles rooks on the e-file\n- It puts pressure on white's rook on e2\n- It doesn't allow white to play any dangerous tactics\n- It maintains control over key squares\n\nOther moves like g3g5 or e4e3 seem less convincing as they don't address the main issues in the position.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to double rooks on the e-file with:\n\n```\nb8e8\n```"
