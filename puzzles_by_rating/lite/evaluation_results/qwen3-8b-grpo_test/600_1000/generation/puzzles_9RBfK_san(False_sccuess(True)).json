When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King safety:\n   - White's king is exposed on g1\n   - Black's king is on e8, also not very safe\n\n3. Key observations:\n   - Black's queen is on d7, putting pressure on the white king\n   - White's queen is on h6, controlling important squares\n   - The bishop on d5 is very active, controlling key diagonals\n   - Black's rook on h3 is very dangerous, controlling the h-file\n\n4. Candidate moves:\n   - Only legal move is g2h3 (Qh6xh3)\n\n5. Analysis of g2h3:\n   - After Qxh3, Black can play Qxh3, and we'd have to recapture with the pawn\n   - Then Black can play Rook takes h2, winning the exchange\n   - Alternatively, after Qxh3, Black might play Qe4, maintaining pressure\n\n6. Other options:\n   - There are no other legal moves, so we must play g2h3\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, the only move is to capture the rook on h3. While the position is difficult, this at least reduces Black's material advantage.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng2h3\n```"
