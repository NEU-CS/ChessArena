When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d8, putting pressure on black's king.\n- Black's queen is on f6, defending the rook on e2.\n- The bishop on d4 is controlling important diagonals.\n- White's king is exposed on g3.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- f6f8: Queen trade. After Qxf8, Rxf8 and white is up a queen. Not good.\n- f6d8: Queen trade. Similar to f6f8, white is up a queen after Qxd8.\n- e2e8: Rook move. This seems interesting as it attacks the queen and creates threats.\n\n4. Best move analysis:\n- e2e8 is the only move that doesn't immediately lose material. After:\n  - If Qxe8, then Rxe8 and black is up a queen.\n  - If Q moves elsewhere, black can consider Qf7 or other active moves.\n\nThe other two moves lead to immediate material loss, so e2e8 is the only reasonable move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne2e8\n```"
