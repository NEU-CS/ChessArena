When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's rook on b4 is very active, controlling the b-file and putting pressure on d4 pawn.\n- White's rook on c1 is not very active currently.\n- Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed.\n- White's pawn structure is solid but not advancing.\n- The d4 pawn is under pressure from the black rook.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c1c6: Rook trade. After Rxc6, Black can recapture with the pawn or rook. Not great.\n- c1c5: Defends d4 pawn and puts pressure on black's c6 pawn.\n- c1c4: Defends d4 pawn directly.\n- d4d5: Pushes the pawn but leaves it more exposed.\n- f3f4: Creates a passed pawn but doesn't address immediate threats.\n- King moves (h1g1): Gets the king to a safer square.\n\nAfter considering all options, c1c5 seems most promising:\n1. Defends the d4 pawn\n2. Put pressure on black's c6 pawn\n3. If black doesn't respond well, we can consider doubling rooks or advancing the d-pawn\n\nThe move c1c4 is also solid but less active. After considering all options, the most active and defensive move is c1c5.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nc1c5\n```"
