When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, two rooks, bishop, pawns). Black has a slight lead in development with both rooks connected and queen active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on e4, putting pressure on f7 and g5.\n- Black's queen is on g5, controlling important diagonals but potentially overextended.\n- Black's bishop on e6 is blocking the rook on f8.\n- White has a passed pawn on e5 that could become dangerous.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e6c8: Blocking the queen and defending f5. After Qe2, Black can play ...Qd7 or ...Qe7. This seems solid.\n- g5d8: Trading queens. After Qxd8, Black can recapture with the rook. This leads to an endgame where Black has slight material advantage (bishop vs pawn).\n- g5e7: Defending f5 and putting pressure on the queen. White would likely play Qf4 or Qd6.\n- f8e8: Connecting rooks and getting the other rook more active.\n- g7g6: Pushing the pawn to challenge White's e5 pawn.\n\nAfter considering all options, e6c8 seems most promising:\n1. It blocks the powerful White queen\n2. It defends the f5 square\n3. It doesn't allow White to maintain too much pressure\n4. It keeps options open\n\nThe move also prevents White from playing Qf4 or Qd6, which would increase their activity. Other moves either allow White to keep too much initiative or don't address the queen's activity.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne6c8\n```"
