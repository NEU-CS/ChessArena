When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's pawn on d6 is passed but blocked by black's pawn on f5.\n- Black's rook on g4 is very active, controlling the g-file and putting pressure on white's king.\n- Black's knight on e4 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- White's knight on f7 is defending the d6 pawn and controlling key squares.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- Rook moves (g4g5, g4h4, etc): g4g5 seems to put pressure on the d6 pawn, but white can just take it back. Other rook moves don't seem as promising.\n- Knight moves (e4f6, e4d6, etc): e4f6 attacks the knight on f7, but white can just move the knight. e4d6 attacks the pawn, but white can defend it.\n- Pawn moves (g6g5, f5f4): g6g5 doesn't seem to accomplish much. f5f4 would open up the position but give white more activity.\n\nAfter considering all options, g4g5 seems the most promising:\n- It puts direct pressure on the d6 pawn\n- If white takes the pawn with d6e7, we can play e4f2, attacking the pawn and threatening to win it back\n- It maintains our rook's activity\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow white to consolidate. Therefore, the best move is to put pressure on the d6 pawn with the rook.\n\n```\ng4g5\n```"
