When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop. White has queen, bishop, knight. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on d8, controlling the back rank.\n- White's bishop on e6 is very active, attacking multiple squares.\n- Black's king is exposed on g6.\n- White has a knight on c3 that can jump into good positions.\n- The f5 pawn is isolated and could become a target.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e6g8: Bishop checks the king. After ...Kxg8, Qd5+ wins the exchange (rook on d5). But black can play ...Qe7 instead, defending g8.\n- c3d5: Knight attacks the queen. After ...Qxd5, exd5 opens up the e-file and white has a material advantage.\n- f2f5: Pushing the pawn to attack the bishop. But black can just take it back.\n- f1e2: Defends the pawn and connects the rooks. Seems solid but not aggressive.\n\nAfter considering all options, e6g8 seems the most promising:\n- It forces black to react to the threat of Qd5+\n- If black takes the bishop, we win the exchange\n- If black doesn't take, we can follow up with Qd5 or other strong moves\n\nThe move c3d5 is also interesting but allows black to trade queens and then have an advantage with the extra pawn.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the most forcing and aggressive move is to play the bishop check:\n\n```\ne6g8\n```"
