When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, pawn. White has queen, rook, pawn. Material is equal but black's queen is more active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is on d8, controlling the back rank and putting pressure on black's king.\n- Black's queen is on e5, very active and threatening multiple squares.\n- Black's rook on f7 is controlling the f-file but not very active otherwise.\n- White's rook on g3 is defending the g2 pawn and controlling the g-file.\n- Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g7f7: Moving the king to f7. This seems passive but gets the king to a safer square. However, it allows white to play Qd8-e7+ with a strong attack.\n- g7h6: Moving the king to h6. This seems even more passive and doesn't improve our position.\n- e5g5: Queen trade. After Qxg5, Rxg5 and white is up a queen. Not good.\n- e5g3: Capturing the rook. After Qxg3, Rxg3 and again white is up a queen.\n\n4. Best move:\nAfter considering all options, g7f7 seems to be the most resilient move. While it doesn't improve our position much, it at least gets the king to a safer square and doesn't allow white to immediately win material.\n\nThe other moves either lose material immediately or lead to a worse position. Therefore, the best move is to get the king to f7.\n\n```\ng7f7\n```"
