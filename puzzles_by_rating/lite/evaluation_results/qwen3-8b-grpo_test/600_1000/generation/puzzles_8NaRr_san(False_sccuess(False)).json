When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, pawns). Black has a slight lead in development with both bishops and queen active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on e4, putting pressure on f5 and g5.\n- Black's queen is on g5, attacking the pawn on g3 and putting pressure on the white king.\n- The f5 knight is well placed, controlling important squares.\n- The black king is somewhat exposed on e8.\n- The c3 bishop is blocking the c2 pawn and not very active.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g5d8: Queen trade. After Qxd8, Black can recapture with the bishop or rook. This would reduce White's attacking potential but give up the active queen.\n- g5e7: Defends f5 square and puts pressure on the white queen. If Qxe7, Black can play Qxe7 and after Nxe7, Black is up a queen.\n- f5e7: Moves the knight to defend d5 and put pressure on the queen. But this seems less active than other options.\n- g5f6: Attacks the pawn on g4 and puts pressure on the white king. But White can just move the pawn.\n- e8d7: King move to get safer. But this seems passive.\n\nAfter considering all options, g5e7 seems the most promising:\n- It forces White to either trade queens or move the queen to a less active square.\n- If White trades queens (Qxe7), Black can recapture with the bishop or rook and be up a queen.\n- If White doesn't trade, Black can consider increasing pressure with moves like Qf6 or Nf5.\n\nThe move g5e7 seems to either win material or force White into a passive position. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ng5e7\n```"
