When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's king is exposed on c6, white has a bishop on e6 controlling important diagonals.\n- White has a strong pawn on e4 that could become a target.\n- Black's queen on d8 is not very active currently.\n- White has castling rights (KQ) but hasn't castled yet.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c6d6: King moves to d6. This seems passive but gets the king to a slightly safer square.\n- c6b6: King moves to b6. Also passive, but may be too exposed on the edge.\n- c6b5: King moves to b5. Even more passive and potentially exposed.\n- d8d5: Queen moves to d5. Attacks the e4 pawn and puts pressure on white's position.\n- e7d5: Knight moves to d5. Attacks the e3 square and puts pressure on white's pawn structure.\n\nAfter considering all options, d8d5 seems the most promising:\n- It actively challenges white's e4 pawn\n- It connects with the other rook\n- It prevents white from playing Qd4 or similar active queen moves\n- It doesn't allow white to maintain too much control over the center\n\nThe other moves are too passive and don't address white's potential activity. Therefore, the best move is to put pressure on white's pawn structure with the queen.\n\n```\nd8d5\n```"
