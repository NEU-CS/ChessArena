When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight vs White's queen, rook, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on d3, putting pressure on black's position.\n- Black's queen on c1 is not very active currently.\n- The knight on f6 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- The pawn structure is locked with pawns on d5 and c6.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e1e8: Queen trade. After Qxe8, Rxe8 and white is up a queen. Not good.\n- f6e8: Knight to e8, blocking the queen. But white can just take the knight.\n- c1g5: Queen to g5, attacking the pawn on g2. But white can defend with Qe5.\n- c1f4: Queen to f4, putting pressure on the pawn on g3.\n- c6d5: Pawn exchange. After dxd5, Qxd5 and white is up a pawn.\n- g7g6: Pushing the pawn to create some counterplay.\n\nAfter considering all options, c1f4 seems the most promising:\n- It activates the queen\n- Put pressure on white's pawn on g3\n- If white defends with Qe5, we can consider Qxe5 dxe5 and we have a material advantage\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or lose material. Therefore, the best move is to activate the queen to f4.\n\n```\nc1f4\n```"
