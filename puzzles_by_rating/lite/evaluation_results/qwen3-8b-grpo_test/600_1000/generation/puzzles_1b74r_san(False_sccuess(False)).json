When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn. White has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on b7, putting pressure on f3 and controlling important squares.\n- Black's king is exposed on e8 with limited pawn cover.\n- The knight on g5 is very strong, attacking multiple squares.\n- The bishop on c5 is blocking the queen's defense of d4 square.\n- The pawn structure is locked in the center with e4 vs e5.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- g8f6: Defends e4 pawn and attacks the queen. After Qb7xf3, Black can play ...Qd7 or ...Qe7 to defend.\n- d8e7: Defends e5 pawn and connects rooks. But White can play Qxe7 after Nxe7.\n- c6e7: Trades off the strong knight. After Qxe7, Black can play ...Qxe7 and the position is simplified.\n- h5e8: Knight to e8, but this seems passive.\n- c5b6: Moves the bishop to a more active diagonal.\n\nAfter considering all options, g8f6 seems most promising:\n1. It defends the e4 pawn which is under attack\n2. It attacks the white queen, forcing it to move or be traded\n3. It improves the knight's position\n4. It doesn't allow White to maintain too much pressure\n\nOther moves either don't address White's active queen or allow White to keep the initiative. Therefore, the best move is to play the knight to f6, putting pressure on White's queen and defending key squares.\n\n```\ng8f6\n```"
