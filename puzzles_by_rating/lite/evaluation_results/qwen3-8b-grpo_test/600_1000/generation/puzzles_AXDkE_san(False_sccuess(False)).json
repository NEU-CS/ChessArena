When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has bishop, rook, knight vs white's bishop, rook, knight. Material is equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's knight on d6 is very strong, attacking multiple squares.\n- Black's king is exposed on f6.\n- White has a passed pawn on c5 that could become dangerous.\n- Black's rook on a5 is not very active currently.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- d8h8: Rook lift to h8, but doesn't seem to accomplish much.\n- d8g8: Similar to h8, not very active.\n- d8f8: Defends f6 square, but white can just take it back.\n- f6e7: King moves to e7, but white can play Qe2 with threats.\n- d5e7: Rook to e7, defending f5 and putting pressure on white's position.\n- d5c7: Rook to c7, blocking the c5 pawn.\n- a5a8: Rook to a8, but seems passive.\n\nAfter considering all options, d5e7 seems the most promising:\n- It defends the f5 square\n- Put pressure on white's position\n- Prevents white from playing Qe2 with threats\n- Maintains control over key diagonals\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow white to gain an advantage. Therefore, the best move is to play the rook to e7.\n\n```\nd5e7\n```"
