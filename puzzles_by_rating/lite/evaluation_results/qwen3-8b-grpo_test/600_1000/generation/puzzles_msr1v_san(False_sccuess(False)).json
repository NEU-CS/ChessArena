When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- Black's rook on e8 is very active, controlling the e-file.\n- White's king is exposed on f2.\n- Black's knight on d3 is well placed, attacking multiple squares.\n- White's knight on e5 is blocking the pawn on c4.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- f2f3: Gets the king to a slightly safer square, but doesn't address immediate threats.\n- f2g2: Moves the king towards the corner, but doesn't improve our position.\n- f2g1: Moves the king to a corner square, but seems passive.\n- f2f1: Moves the king to the back rank, but doesn't seem to help.\n\nAfter considering all options, f2f3 seems the most reasonable move:\n- It gets the king to a slightly safer square\n- It doesn't allow Black to play any immediate tactics\n- It maintains some control over the position\n\nThe other moves either don't improve our position or make the king too passive. While the position is likely lost due to material deficit, we should at least play actively.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nf2f3\n```"
