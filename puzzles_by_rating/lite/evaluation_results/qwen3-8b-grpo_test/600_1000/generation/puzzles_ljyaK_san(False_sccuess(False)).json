When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, bishop, pawn. Black has queen, bishop, knight, pawn. Black is up a knight.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is very active on g4, putting pressure on g2 and c8.\n- White's queen is on a8, not very active currently.\n- Black has a bishop on c4 controlling important diagonals.\n- White's king is still in the center (e1).\n- Black's king is on e7, also not very safe.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- a8g8: Qxg8, but after ...Qxg8 we're down material and black has a winning position.\n- g2b7: Qxb7, but after ...Qxb7 we're down material.\n- g2c6: Qxc6, but after ...Qxc6 we're down material.\n- g1f3: Nf3, blocking the queen and developing a piece.\n- e1f1: Kf1, getting the king to safety.\n- b1c3: Nc3, blocking the bishop and developing a piece.\n\nAfter considering all options, g1f3 seems most promising:\n- It blocks the black queen's attack on g2\n- Develops a knight\n- Prevents black from playing Qxg2+\n- Maintains some control over the center\n\nOther moves either lose material immediately or don't address the immediate threats. While we're down a knight, g1f3 at least improves our piece coordination and makes black work harder to win.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng1f3\n```"
