When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn. White has queen, bishop, knight, pawn. Black is up a rook but white has an extra pawn.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is on e2, controlling important squares.\n- Black's queen is on d8, somewhat exposed.\n- Black's king is on c8, not very safe.\n- White has a strong bishop on d3 controlling diagonals.\n- The pawn structure is locked in the center with pawns on d5 and e5.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e8f7: Rook lift to f7, defending the queen and putting pressure on f5.\n- e7f6: Bishop to f6, defending g7 and putting pressure on e5.\n- c6e5: Knight to e5, attacking the pawn and putting pressure on d3.\n- d8c8: Queen trade, but after Qxc8 Rfxc8 black is up a rook but white has two bishops.\n\nAfter considering all options, e8f7 seems most promising:\n- Defends the queen\n- Put pressure on f5 square\n- Doesn't allow white to play Qe1 or similar active moves\n- Maintains control over the dark squares\n\nOther moves either don't address white's active pieces or allow white to gain counterplay. The rook lift to f7 seems solid and improves black's piece coordination.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne8f7\n```"
