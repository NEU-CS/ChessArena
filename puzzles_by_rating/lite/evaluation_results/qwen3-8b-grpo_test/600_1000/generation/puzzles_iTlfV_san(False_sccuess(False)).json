When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, bishop, rook, pawn. Black has queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn. Black is up a knight but white has an extra pawn.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on e7, putting pressure on the white king.\n- White's rook on h5 is very active, attacking the black queen.\n- The bishop on c4 is controlling important diagonals.\n- Black's knight on g6 is well placed, defending f4 and e5 squares.\n- The pawn structure is locked in the center with pawns on d5 and e5.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- h5h7: Rook trade. After Qxh7, Qxh7 Nxh7 and white is up a queen. But black can play Qf5 instead, defending h7.\n- c4f7: Bishop to f7, attacking the queen. But after Qxf7, Rxf7 and white is up a bishop.\n- g3e5: Queen trade. After Qxe5, Nxe5 and black is up a queen.\n- d1d2: Defends f4 square and prepares to double rooks.\n- c1d2: King safety move.\n\nAfter considering all options, h5h7 seems the most promising:\n- If black plays Qxh7, we can play Qxh7 Nxh7 and we're up a queen.\n- If black doesn't take the rook, we can consider other attacks.\n\nThe move h5h7 forces black to either give up the queen or allow us to win material. It's the most direct way to exploit our active rook and put pressure on black's queen.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\nh5h7\n```"
