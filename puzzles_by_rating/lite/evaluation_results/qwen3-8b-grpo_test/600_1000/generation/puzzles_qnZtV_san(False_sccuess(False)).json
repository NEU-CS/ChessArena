When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, bishop, pawn. Black has queen, rook, pawn. Material is roughly equal.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on d6, controlling important diagonals.\n- White's queen is on e3, putting pressure on black's position.\n- Black's king is on g7, somewhat exposed.\n- White has a bishop on c1 that's not very active currently.\n- The pawn structure is locked with pawns on d4 and c4.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- e3e8: Qe8 looks tempting to attack the black rook on a8, but after ...Qa6 it's not clear what's gained.\n- e3e7: Qe7 attacks the pawn on f6 and puts pressure on the king.\n- c1c8: Bc8 to activate the bishop and put pressure on the queen.\n- b1c2: Rb1-c2 to defend the pawn and potentially double rooks.\n- f3f4: Pushing the pawn to open up the position.\n\nAfter considering these options, e3e7 seems most promising:\n- It attacks the f6 pawn which is only defended by the king.\n- If black defends with ...Qe6, we can consider Qxe6 dxe6 and we have a material advantage.\n- If black doesn't defend, we can take the pawn and increase our pressure.\n\nOther moves either don't create enough threats or allow black to consolidate their position. The move e3e7 creates immediate tactical problems for black to solve.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ne3e7\n```"
