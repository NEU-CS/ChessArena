When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Key features:\n- White's queen is very active on g4, putting pressure on f5 and h4 squares.\n- Black's queen is on d7, somewhat exposed.\n- Black's knight on g8 is not very active currently.\n- White has a rook on b7 controlling the b-file.\n- Black's bishop on c5 is blocking the pawn on d5.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- h8h7: Moves the knight to h7, but it's not very active there.\n- g8e7: Moves the knight to e7, attacking the queen. After Qe7, Black can play Qxe7 and win the exchange.\n- f7f8: Moves the queen to f8, but it's not very active there.\n- d7e7: Moves the queen to e7, blocking the bishop and not very active.\n- c5f8: Moves the bishop to f8, but it's not very active there.\n- c5e7: Moves the bishop to e7, blocking the queen.\n\nAfter considering all the options, g8e7 seems to be the most promising move. It attacks the white queen, and if White takes the knight with Qxe7, Black can recapture with Qxe7 and be up a piece.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to play the knight to e7, putting pressure on the white queen.\n\n```\ng8e7\n```"
