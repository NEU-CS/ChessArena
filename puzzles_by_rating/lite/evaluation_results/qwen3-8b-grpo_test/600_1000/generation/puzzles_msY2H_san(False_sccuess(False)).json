When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: Both sides have equal material (queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, pawns). Black has a slight lead in development with both bishops active.\n\n2. Key features:\n- White's queen is on e2, somewhat exposed\n- Black's queen is on c7, controlling important diagonals\n- Both sides have castled positions\n- Black's bishop on g4 is very active, putting pressure on f3 and h3\n- The d5 and c5 pawns are potential targets\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- c7d8: Queen trade. After Qxd8, Rfxd8 and White is fine. Not great.\n- c7e7: Defends f5 square, but doesn't improve position much.\n- f6d8: Bishop trade. After Bxd8, Qxd8 and White is fine.\n- g4c8: Bishop trade. After Bxc8, Qxc8 and White is fine.\n- f6e7: Defends d5 pawn, but blocks the queen.\n- g4d7: Bishop to d7, defending c5 pawn and putting pressure on e6.\n- a8e8: Rook lift to e8, increasing pressure on e-file.\n\nAfter considering all options, g4d7 seems most promising:\n1. Defends the c5 pawn which is under some pressure\n2. Put pressure on e6 square, potentially preparing to double rooks\n3. Doesn't allow White to play Qd4 or similar active moves\n4. Maintains control over important diagonals\n\nOther moves either don't improve our position or allow White to become too active. The bishop on d7 would be very strong, controlling key squares and preventing White from playing f4 or e4.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n```\ng4d7\n```"
