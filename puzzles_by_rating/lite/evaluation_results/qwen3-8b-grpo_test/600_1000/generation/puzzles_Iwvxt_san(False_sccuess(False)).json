When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let me analyze the position carefully:\n\n1. Material count: White has queen, rook, knight, pawn. Black has queen, two rooks, knight, pawn. Black is up a rook but white has queen vs queen.\n\n2. Key features:\n- Black's queen is on d5, putting pressure on white's position.\n- White's queen is on b7, controlling important squares.\n- Black's king is on g8, somewhat exposed.\n- White's knight on e5 is very active, attacking multiple squares.\n- Black's rook on c8 is not very active currently.\n\n3. Candidate moves analysis:\n- b7c8: Qxc8, trading queens. After Rxc8, white is down material (rook vs knight). Not great.\n- e5f7: Nxf7, attacking the queen. After Qxf7, white can play Qxf7 and after Rxf7, white is up a queen. But black can just move the queen instead.\n- e5d7: Nxd7, attacking the queen. After Qxd7, white can play Qxd7 and after Rxd7, white is up a queen. But black can just move the queen instead.\n- e3e4: Rook lift to e4, defending d4 and putting pressure on black's position.\n- a1f1: Rook lift to f1, defending the king and putting pressure on f7.\n\nAfter considering all options, e5f7 seems most promising:\n- If black moves the queen, we can win material\n- If black doesn't, we can consider Qxf7 next move\n- It also opens up the possibility of a discovered attack if the knight moves\n\nThe move e5f7 creates the most problems for black to solve. Therefore, the best move is:\n\n```\ne5f7\n```"
