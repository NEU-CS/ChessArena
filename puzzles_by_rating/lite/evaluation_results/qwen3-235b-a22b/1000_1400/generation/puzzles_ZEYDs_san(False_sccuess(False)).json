If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/2k2B2/8/PK2p1p1/4n3/6P1/8/8 w - - 0 50\n```\n\nThis means:\n\n- White to move.\n- White king on b5, bishop on f7, pawn on a5 and g3.\n- Black king on c7, knight on e4, pawns on e5 and g5.\n- No castling rights, no en passant.\n- Move count: 50 (half-moves since last capture/pawn move).\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Material:**\n- White: K(b5), B(f7), P(a5, g3)\n- Black: K(c7), N(e4), P(e5, g5)\n\nMaterial is roughly equal: bishop vs knight, same number of pawns.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features:**\n\n1. **White bishop on f7** \u2013 currently on a strong diagonal, but could be vulnerable if the black king advances.\n2. **White king on b5** \u2013 close to the a5-pawn, supporting its advance.\n3. **Black king on c7** \u2013 central, can support e5 or counterattack on queenside.\n4. **Black knight on e4** \u2013 active, eyes the d2, f2, and possibly c5 or g3.\n5. **Pawns:**\n   - a5 vs no black queenside pawns \u2013 a-pawn is passed and close to queening.\n   - e5 and g5 are isolated; g5 is on an open file.\n\n---\n\n### **Goal:**\nWhite has a **passed a-pawn** on a5, supported by the king on b5. This is the most promising asset. The plan should be to **push a5-a6-a7-a8=Q**, with king support.\n\nBut we must be cautious: Black has a knight on e4 that could potentially interfere, and the king on c7 might race to stop the pawn.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the **candidate moves** from the legal list:\n\n```\nf7g8, f7e8, f7g6, f7e6, f7h5, f7d5, f7c4, f7b3, f7a2,\nb5a6, b5c4, b5b4, b5a4,\na5a6,\ng3g4\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluate the a-pawn push**\n\n**a5a6** \u2013 Pushing the pawn.\n\nAfter **a5a6**, Black can play **Kc7-b6**, attacking the pawn immediately.\n\nWhite king is on b5 \u2013 can it defend?\n\nAfter:\n1. a5a6 Kb6\n2. Kc4? (trying to support) but then ...Nc3! or ...Nc5+ might harass.\n\nBut wait: after **a5a6 Kb6**, White can play **Kc4?** \u2013 but that walks into **Nc3!**, forking king and bishop?\n\nWait: Nc3 attacks b5 and d5, but b5 is empty. White bishop is on f7.\n\nNo immediate fork.\n\nBut **Nc3** would threaten to win the a6 pawn if not careful.\n\nAlternatively, after **a5a6 Kb6**, White can play **Kb4!**, keeping king close.\n\nBut still, Black might play ...Nc5+, forking king and pawn?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- a5a6 Kb6\n- Kb4 Nc5?\n- Kc4! \u2013 now knight is attacked, must move, and White can follow up with Kb5 or Ka4.\n\nBut Black can play ...Kxa6, if given time.\n\nSo after a5a6, if White doesn\u2019t support with king, Black king captures.\n\nSo **a5a6** is only good if the king can support it.\n\nHence, better to **prepare** with **Kb5-a6** first?\n\nWait: **b5a6** is a legal move.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **b5a6**:\n\n- King moves to a6, attacking the black king? No: a6 is adjacent to b7, c7, b5, etc.\n\nAfter **b5a6**, Black plays **Kc7-b6!**, attacking the white king.\n\nThen White must move: Ka6-a7 or Ka6-b5.\n\nIf Ka7, then ...Kxa7, and the a5 pawn is still on a5, not advanced.\n\nSo **b5a6? Kb6** wins the king? No, king can retreat.\n\nBut no progress: we lose time.\n\nSo **b5a6** is premature.\n\nBetter: **Kb5-b6**? Not legal \u2013 not in the list.\n\nLegal king moves: b5a6, b5c4, b5b4, b5a4.\n\nNone of which are b6.\n\nSo we cannot go to b6 directly.\n\nSo the idea is: **advance the a-pawn with king support**.\n\nBut to do that safely, we need to **prevent the black king from capturing on a6**.\n\nSo perhaps **a5a6** is best, but only if we can follow up.\n\nBut after **a5a6 Kb6**, we need to defend.\n\nWhite bishop can help?\n\nCan bishop control b6?\n\nCurrently bishop on f7 \u2013 can it get to a7 or b8?\n\nYes: f7 \u2192 e6 \u2192 d5 \u2192 c4 \u2192 b3 \u2192 a2, but that\u2019s slow.\n\nBut f7-d5 is a legal move.\n\nBut let\u2019s think: is there a way to **restrict the black king**?\n\nAlternatively, can we **trap the knight**?\n\nBlack knight on e4 \u2013 is it vulnerable?\n\nWhite bishop on f7, king on b5.\n\nCan we play **f7-g6?** That attacks e4? No: g6 doesn\u2019t attack e4.\n\nf7-e6? e6 attacks c8, d7, e8, f7, g8 \u2013 not e4.\n\nf7-d5? d5 attacks e4!\n\nYes! **f7d5** is a move that **attacks the knight on e4**.\n\nThat\u2019s interesting.\n\nLet\u2019s explore:\n\n**f7d5** \u2013 bishop moves to d5, attacking e4.\n\nNow Black must respond.\n\nIf Black moves the knight, say **Nc3** or **Nc5** or **Nf6**, then White can play **a5a6!**, and now the knight is not in a position to quickly help stop the pawn.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. f7d5 Nf6 (only move to save knight)\n2. a5a6! Kb6\n3. Bxf6 gxf6\n4. Ka4! \u2013 now king supports a6, and if ...Kxa6, Kb4, winning.\n\nWait: after 3...gxf6, 4. Ka4, Black king on b6, pawn on a6.\n\nIf 4...Kxa6, 5. Kb4, and White has a passed pawn on b-file? No, no b-pawn.\n\nBut White has a king on b4, Black king far, and pawns: White g3, Black e5, g5.\n\nBut more importantly, after 4. Ka4, if Black doesn\u2019t take, say 4...Kb7, then 5. Kb5, and a6-a7, queening.\n\nSo yes, White makes progress.\n\nBut what if after **1. f7d5**, Black plays **Kb6** instead of moving the knight?\n\nThen White plays **2. Bxe4!**, winning the knight!\n\nBecause knight is pinned? No, not pinned.\n\nBut after **1. f7d5 Kb6**, then **2. Bxe4** \u2013 yes, captures the knight, since no protection.\n\nBlack knight on e4 is attacked by bishop on d5.\n\nIs it defended? By whom?\n\nBlack king on b6 \u2013 too far.\n\ne5 pawn? No.\n\ng5 pawn? No.\n\nSo **knight on e4 is undefended**!\n\nWait \u2013 is that true?\n\nBlack has no piece defending e4.\n\nYes! The knight on e4 is **hanging**!\n\nSo White can **immediately win the knight** with **f7d5**, because after **Bd5**, it attacks e4, and the knight is not defended.\n\nBut wait: is **f7d5** a legal move? Yes, it's in the list.\n\nAnd after **f7d5**, if Black doesn't capture or move the knight, White captures next move.\n\nBut Black must respond.\n\nBut even if Black moves king or pawn, White plays **Bxe4**.\n\nSo **f7d5** wins a piece immediately.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- Black knight on e4.\n- No black piece attacks e4.\n- Black king on c7 \u2013 does it attack e4? c7 attacks b6, b7, c6, d6, d7, d8 \u2013 not e4.\n- e5 pawn attacks d4, f4 \u2013 not e4.\n- g5 pawn attacks f4 \u2013 not e4.\n\nSo yes, **knight on e4 is undefended**.\n\nSo **Bd5** attacks it.\n\nAfter **f7d5**, Black must deal with the threat of **Bxe4**.\n\nBut Black has no way to defend it.\n\nSo Black loses the knight.\n\nTherefore, **f7d5** wins a piece.\n\nNow,"
