When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n2kr2nN/pp4pp/q1p2p2/3P4/4P1P1/2P3nP/P1QB2B1/1R2K3 w - - 1 22\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Position**\n\nFEN breakdown:\n- **White pieces**:\n  - King: e1\n  - Queen: d2\n  - Rook: b1\n  - Bishops: c2, g2\n  - Knight: h8\n  - Pawns: a2, c3, d5, e4, g4, h3\n- **Black pieces**:\n  - King: c8 (in the corner, potentially vulnerable)\n  - Queen: a6\n  - Knight: g8, h3\n  - Pawns: a7, b7, c6, f6, g7, h7\n  - Note: Black has a knight on h3 (attacking g1), and a knight on g8.\n  - Black\u2019s king is on c8 \u2014 possibly vulnerable to a back-rank or diagonal attack.\n\nWhite has a knight on h8 \u2014 a very awkward square, but it can jump to **f7** or **g6**.\n\nWhite has a bishop on g2, queen on d2, and both are pointing toward the kingside.\n\nBlack\u2019s king is on c8, with rook on d8. The black king hasn't castled and is stuck in the corner. White may have attacking chances.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Tactical Opportunities**\n\nLet\u2019s look at **immediate tactical shots**.\n\n#### **Knight on h8:**\n- **h8f7**: Knight takes on f7. Let's see:\n  - f7 is defended by black\u2019s g7 pawn and possibly the g8 knight.\n  - But after **Nxf7**, what happens?\n    - If **Nxf7**, then **Kxf7**? No \u2014 Black\u2019s king is on c8.\n    - But **Nxf7** attacks the queen on a6? No, not directly.\n    - Wait: **Nxf7** attacks the **rook on d8** via discovered attack? Let\u2019s see:\n      - The white queen is on d2, bishop on c2 \u2014 both on the d-file and diagonal.\n      - If **Nxf7**, and if the black king is on c8, and rook on d8, then:\n        - After **Nxf7**, if Black recaptures with **gxf7**, then the diagonal opens.\n        - But more importantly: is there a discovered attack?\n\nWait \u2014 **Nf7+**? Is f7 attacked by the black king? No.\n\nBut **Nf7** is a **check**? Let's see:\n\n- Knight from h8 to f7 \u2014 does that give check?\n  - f7 is two squares down and one left from h8 \u2192 yes, **Nf7** attacks e5, d6, g5, h5, e8, d7 \u2014 **e8** is a square.\n  - Black king is on **c8**, so **Nf7 does NOT give check**.\n\nSo **Nxf7** is just a piece sacrifice.\n\n- What does it achieve?\n  - Takes a pawn.\n  - Opens the g-file for the g2 bishop.\n  - But black can play **gxf7**, and now the g-file is open, but white has no immediate follow-up.\n\nNot clearly winning.\n\nBut what if **Nf7** is followed by **Qa5+** or something?\n\nLet\u2019s consider **h8g6** \u2014 Knight to g6.\n\n- **Ng6** attacks f8 and h8, but more importantly, **Ng6** threatens **Nf8**, forking king and rook?\n  - Black king on c8, rook on d8 \u2014 **Nf8+** would win the rook!\n  - So **Ng6** prepares **Nf8+**.\n\nIs **Nf8+** possible after **Ng6**?\n\n- After **Ng6**, if Black does nothing, **Nf8+** wins the rook on d8.\n\nCan Black prevent it?\n\n- Black can play **Rd7**, **Kb8**, **Rd6**, etc.\n\nBut if White plays **Ng6**, it\u2019s a **threat of Nf8+**, winning material.\n\nIs **Nf8+** legal?\n\n- From g6, knight to f8: yes, it\u2019s a knight move.\n\n- After **Nf8+**, king must move \u2014 **Kc7** or **Kb8**, and then **Nxd8** wins the rook.\n\nSo **Ng6** threatens **Nf8+**, winning a rook for knight \u2014 a good trade.\n\nIs there any defense?\n\nBlack might play **Rd7** to block, but then **Nf8+** still works? No \u2014 **Nf8+** is check, but if rook is on d7, it doesn\u2019t block.\n\nWait: **Nf8+** comes from g6 to f8 \u2014 the rook on d7 doesn\u2019t interfere.\n\nSo **Nf8+** is still possible.\n\nBut after **Nf8+**, Black plays **Kc7**, then **Nxd8**, and White wins a rook.\n\nYes \u2014 so **Ng6** leads to winning a rook in two moves, unless Black prevents it.\n\nCan Black prevent **Nf8+**?\n\n- Only by moving the rook, blocking with a piece, or capturing the knight.\n\nBut Black has no piece that can capture on g6.\n\n- g6 is protected by White\u2019s g4 pawn? No \u2014 g4 is on g4, g6 is two squares up.\n\ng6 is currently **undefended**.\n\nSo **Ng6** is **en prise**?\n\nWait \u2014 can Black capture on g6?\n\n- Black has:\n  - h7 pawn \u2014 can it take? h7 to g6? Yes, **hxg6**.\n\nSo after **Ng6**, Black can play **hxg6**, capturing the knight.\n\nThen no **Nf8+**.\n\nSo **Ng6** is met by **hxg6**, and White loses a knight for a pawn \u2014 bad.\n\nSo **Ng6** is **not good** \u2014 it loses material.\n\nSo **h8g6** is bad.\n\nWhat about **h8f7**?\n\n- **Nxf7**\n- Black can recapture with **Kxf7**? No \u2014 king is on c8.\n- So **gxf7** or **Nxf7**?\n\nBlack has knight on g8 \u2014 can play **Nxh8**, but that\u2019s after.\n\nAfter **Nxf7**, Black plays **gxf7**, opening the g-file.\n\nNow White has **Bishop on g2** \u2014 now the g-file is open.\n\nBut no immediate tactic.\n\nWhite can play **Qh6**, threatening mate on h7?\n\nBut not immediately.\n\nAlso, **Nxf7** loses a knight for a pawn \u2014 unless there\u2019s a follow-up.\n\nBut Black can just play **gxf7**, and White has no immediate mate.\n\nSo **h8f7** seems speculative.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **discovered attack**?\n\nAfter **Nxf7**, if Black plays **gxf7**, then the diagonal from g2 to a8 opens.\n\nWhite has **Bishop on g2**, pointing at a8 \u2014 but a8 is empty.\n\nBlack\u2019s king is on c8 \u2014 is it on the diagonal?\n\ng2 to c8? g2 is light square, c8 is dark \u2014 no, **g2 bishop is light-squared**, so it doesn't go to c8.\n\nSo no discovered attack.\n\nSo **Nxf7** seems like a poor move.\n\nSo both knight moves are bad.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Look at Other Candidates**\n\nLet\u2019s look at **d5xc6** \u2014 **d5c6**\n\n- Takes on c6.\n- Black has knight on h3, queen on a6.\n- After **dxc6**, what happens?\n\n- **dxc6** opens the d-file.\n- Black can play **Qxc6**, recapturing.\n\nThen White can play **Qd8+**, check?\n\nQueen on d2 to d8 \u2014 yes, **Qd8+**.\n\nThen **Kc7**, and **Qc8+**, **Kb6**, etc. \u2014 but Black can play **Rxd8**?\n\nAfter **Qd8+**, **Kc7**, then **Qc8+**, **Kb6**, then **Qb8+**, chasing king.\n\nBut better: after **Qd8+**, if **Rxd8**, then **Rxd8+**, winning the rook.\n\nYes!\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n1. **d5c6** \u2014 White takes on c6\n2. Black plays **Qxc6** (best, otherwise c6 pawn falls anyway)\n3. **Qd8+** \u2014 check\n   - If **Kc7**, then **Qc8+** \u2014 **Kb6**, **Qb8+**, **Ka5**, etc. \u2014 messy.\n   - But better: after **Qd8+**, Black **must** play **Rxd8** to stop mate?\n     - Is **Qd8#** possible? No \u2014 rook is on d8.\n     - So **Qd8+** attacks the king"
