When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n1r1qkbnr/pp2p1pp/2p3b1/4p3/2Pp1BP1/1Q5P/PP2PPB1/RN2K2R w KQk - 0 12\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLet\u2019s first **analyze the position** carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Position**\n\nFEN breakdown:\n- **White pieces**: King on e1, Rooks on a1 and h1, Knight on b1, Bishop on g2 and f4, Queen on b3, pawns on a2, b2, c4, e2, f2, g4, h3\n- **Black pieces**: King on e8, Rook on b8, Queen on d8, Bishop on g6, Knight on f6, pawns on a7, b7, c6, e5, d4, f7, g7, h7\n\nWhite has:\n- **Bishop pair**, both active.\n- **King-side bishop (g2)** pointing at the center and kingside.\n- **Light-squared bishop on f4**, which is very strong, eyeing the weak dark squares around Black\u2019s king.\n- **Queen on b3**, attacking b7 and potentially eyeing the back rank or e6.\n- **Pawn on c4**, controlling d5.\n- **Pawn on d4** is Black\u2019s central pawn, but it\u2019s isolated and potentially weak.\n\nBlack has:\n- **Queen on d8**, Rook on b8 \u2014 both on open files.\n- **Bishop on g6**, which is somewhat passive.\n- **Knight on f6**, natural development.\n- **Pawn on d4**, advanced but possibly overextended.\n- **King still in the center**, hasn't castled \u2014 **this is critical**.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s check castling rights:\n\nFEN says: `w KQk -` \u2014 so White can castle kingside and queenside, Black can only castle kingside (`k`). But looking at the position:\n\n- Black\u2019s king is on e8, rook on h8 \u2014 so kingside castling is theoretically possible.\n- But **rook on b8** \u2014 so queenside castling is not possible (rook moved? Or king?).\n- FEN says Black can castle kingside only (`k`), so that\u2019s consistent.\n\nBut **Black hasn't castled yet**, and the king is still in the center. This is a key vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Tactical Opportunities**\n\nLet\u2019s look for **immediate threats** or **tactical shots**.\n\n#### **Key feature: Black\u2019s king is exposed in the center.**\n\nWhite has:\n- Bishop on **f4**, which targets **e5**, **d6**, **c7**, and importantly, **g5** and **h6**.\n- Queen on **b3**, which targets **b7** (pawn), and potentially can line up on the e-file if e1-e3-e4 happens.\n- Light-squared bishop on **g2**, supporting f3 and e4 ideas.\n- The **f4-bishop** is especially dangerous \u2014 it\u2019s pointing at the diagonal **f4\u2013a5**, but more importantly, **f4\u2013h6** is a potential **discovered attack** or **sacrifice** square.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **f4-h6** \u2014 that\u2019s a legal move: `f4h6`.\n\nWhat happens if **Bxh6**?\n\nLet\u2019s calculate:\n\n### **Candidate Move: f4h6**\n\n**1. Bxh6**\n\n- Takes on h6, **sacrificing the bishop**.\n- Black must recapture \u2014 only possible recapture is **gxh6** (pawn or king? g7-g6 is already played, so g7 is empty, g6 has bishop. So **g7xh6**).\n\nAfter:\n- 1. Bxh6 gxh6\n- Now, White has **opened the h-file**, and Black\u2019s king is exposed.\n- Also, **Black\u2019s kingside pawns are shattered**, and the king is still in the center.\n\nBut more importantly \u2014 **is there a follow-up?**\n\nNow, White can play **Qg3**, threatening mate on g7 or h8.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: after **1. Bxh6 gxh6**, what is the position?\n\n- Black\u2019s king is on e8, now with h7-h6, g7-g6, so the kingside is wrecked.\n- White has **Qb3**, which can go to **g3** or **f3**, eyeing h6 or g7.\n\nBut even better: **after Bxh6 gxh6, Qg3** threatens **Qg7#**.\n\nCan Black stop it?\n\n- Black can play **Qe7**, **Be7**, **Kd7**, or **Rg8**, etc.\n\nBut let\u2019s see:\n\n**1. Bxh6 gxh6 2. Qg3**\n\nNow threat: **Qg7#**\n\nBlack must respond.\n\n- **2... Qe7** \u2014 blocks g7, but then **3. Bh3!** (or Qxh6) \u2014 but Qxh6 attacks h6 and threatens mate on h7 or e6.\n\nWait \u2014 better: **after 2. Qg3**, if **2... Qe7**, then **3. Qxh6** \u2014 now threatening **Qh7#** or **Qg7#**.\n\nBlack has no good defense.\n\nAlternatively, **2... Be7** \u2014 same idea, **3. Qxh6**, still threatening mate.\n\nOr **2... Kd7**, then **3. Qg7+ Be7 4. Qf6**, and Black is lost.\n\nSo **Bxh6** looks **very strong** \u2014 it\u2019s a **sacrifice to rip open the king**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **Bxh6** safe? Does Black have a refutation?\n\nLet\u2019s check if **Bxh6** is met by something better than **gxh6**.\n\nCan Black **not take**? For example, **interpose**?\n\nNo \u2014 bishop is on f4, takes on h6 \u2014 only way to remove it is **gxh6**.\n\nSo Black **must** recapture with the g-pawn.\n\nSo **1. Bxh6 gxh6 2. Qg3** \u2014 and mate is coming.\n\nBut wait \u2014 can Black play **2... Qh4**?\n\nAfter **1. Bxh6 gxh6 2. Qg3**, Black plays **2... Qh4** \u2014 attacking g3 and threatening Qh2#?\n\nWait \u2014 **Qh4**, is that possible?\n\nBlack\u2019s queen is on d8 \u2014 can it go to h4?\n\nFrom d8 to h4 \u2014 that\u2019s diagonal, but is it blocked?\n\nd8 \u2192 e7 \u2192 f6 \u2192 g5 \u2192 h4 \u2014 but **f6 has black knight**, so **no**, the queen **cannot** go to h4.\n\nSo **Qh4** is not possible.\n\nWhat about **Qd6** or **Qd7**? Possible, but doesn't stop Qg3.\n\nAfter **2. Qg3**, Black\u2019s only real try is **2... Qe7** or **2... Be7** or **2... Rg8**.\n\nBut none stop **Qxh6** and the mating net.\n\nAlternatively, after **1. Bxh6 gxh6 2. Qg3**, Black could play **2... Nh5**, blocking g7?\n\n**Nh5** \u2014 knight from f6 to h5 \u2014 yes, that\u2019s possible.\n\nThen **3. Qg7# is blocked**, but White can play **3. Qxh6**, threatening **Qh7#**.\n\nNow Black must play **3... Kd7** or **3... Rg8**, but **4. Qh7+** is still coming.\n\nFor example:\n\n- 3... Kd7 4. Qh7+ Kc8 5. Ne5 (or Bh3+) \u2014 winning.\n\nSo even **Nh5** doesn\u2019t save Black.\n\nThus, **Bxh6** leads to a forced win.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **defensive resource**?\n\nWhat if after **1. Bxh6**, Black plays **1... Bh5** instead of **gxh6**?\n\nNo \u2014 **Bh5** doesn\u2019t capture the bishop. The bishop on f4 is captured only by the g7 pawn.\n\nSo Black **must** play **gxh6**.\n\nSo **Bxh6** is **forced**.\n\nThus, **1. Bxh6** is a **winning sacrifice**.\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check: is **Bxh6** even legal?\n\nYes \u2014 **f4h6** is in the legal moves list.\n\nNow, are there any **refutations**?\n\nWait \u2014 what if after **1. Bxh6 gxh6 2. Qg3**, Black plays **2... Qh4!?**\n\nEarlier I said Qh4 is not possible due to knight on f6 \u2014 but **after gxh6**, the knight is still on f6.\n\nd8 to h4 \u2014 diagonal: d8-c7-b6-a5 \u2014 no, that\u2019s not the direction.\n\nd8 to h4 is **a2-h8 diagonal** \u2014 d8, e7, f6,"
