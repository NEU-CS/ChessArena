When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

R . . K .     \u2192 3R2K1\n\n    a b c d e f g h\n```\n\nSo the key pieces:\n\n**White:**\n- King on g1\n- Queen on c8\n- Rook on d1\n- Pawns: h3, f2\n\n**Black:**\n- King on d5\n- Knight on e5\n- Rook on f5\n- Pawns: c4, f6, g6, b7\n- Queens on b6 and c5? Wait \u2014 two queens?\n\nWait \u2014 **b6 is a queen**, and **c5 is a knight**? Let's double-check.\n\nFEN: `2Q5/1p6/1q3pp1/2kn1r2/2p5/7P/5P2/3R2K1`\n\nSo:\n\n- **a8\u2013h8**: `2Q5` \u2192 a8: empty, b8: empty, c8: **Q**, rest empty\n- **a7\u2013h7**: `1p6` \u2192 b7: **p**, rest empty\n- **a6\u2013h6**: `1q3pp1` \u2192 b6: **q**, f6: p, g6: p, h6: p\n- **a5\u2013h5**: `2kn1r2` \u2192 c5: **k**, d5: **n**, e5: **knight?** Wait \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 `2kn1r2` \u2192 two empty, then **k**, **n**, empty, **r**, two empty.\n\nSo:\n- c5: **k** (king)\n- d5: **n** (knight)\n- f5: **r** (rook)\n\nWait \u2014 that can't be. The king is on c5, knight on d5?\n\nBut then on d5 we have a knight, and on c5 a king.\n\nBut then the move list includes **c5d6**, **c5b5**, **c5b4** \u2014 so the piece on c5 can move \u2014 so it must be a **knight** or **king**?\n\nWait \u2014 FEN says: `2kn1r2` on rank 5.\n\nSo:\n- a5: empty\n- b5: empty\n- c5: **k**\n- d5: **n**\n- e5: empty\n- f5: **r**\n- g5: empty\n- h5: empty\n\nSo:\n- **King on c5**\n- **Knight on d5**\n- **Rook on f5**\n\nBut then the move list includes **d5c7** \u2014 knight from d5 to c7?\n\nAnd **c5d6**, **c5b5**, **c5b4** \u2014 king moves?\n\nBut also **b6c7**, **b6c6** \u2014 queen on b6?\n\nAnd **c5b4** \u2014 king from c5 to b4?\n\nWait \u2014 but the move list includes **c5d6**, **c5b5**, **c5b4** \u2014 so the piece on c5 is moving. But if it's the **king**, that\u2019s possible.\n\nBut then **d5c7** \u2014 knight from d5 to c7?\n\nYes.\n\nBut also, **b6c7** \u2014 queen from b6 to c7?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about **c5** \u2014 is it a **king** or a **knight**?\n\nFEN: `2kn1r2` \u2014 so c5: **k**, d5: **n**\n\nSo:\n- **King on c5**\n- **Knight on d5**\n- **Rook on f5**\n- **Queen on b6**\n- **Pawn on c4**\n- **White queen on c8**\n- **White rook on d1**\n- **White king on g1**\n- **White pawns on h3, f2**\n- **Black pawns on b7, f6, g6, h6, c4**\n\nWait \u2014 c4 is a black pawn? Yes, FEN rank 4: `2p5` \u2192 c4: **p**\n\nSo Black has:\n- King: c5\n- Knight: d5\n- Rook: f5\n- Queen: b6\n- Pawns: b7, c4, f6, g6, h6\n\nWhite:\n- Queen: c8\n- Rook: d1\n- King: g1\n- Pawns: f2, h3\n\nNow, it's **Black to move**.\n\nLegal moves given:\n- **c5d6** \u2014 King from c5 to d6\n- **c5b5** \u2014 King to b5\n- **c5b4** \u2014 King to b4\n- **b6c7** \u2014 Queen b6 to c7\n- **b6c6** \u2014 Queen to c6\n- **d5c7** \u2014 Knight d5 to c7\n\nSo we must choose the best among these.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate threats and opportunities**\n\n**White has a queen on c8**, which is **attacking the black king on c5**!\n\nWait \u2014 c8 to c5 is a vertical file \u2014 yes, queen on c8 is on the same file as king on c5.\n\nSo **White is giving check**?\n\nBut it's Black to move \u2014 so if White is checking, Black must get out of check.\n\nIs the black king on c5 in check?\n\nQueen on c8 \u2014 same file, no pieces between?\n\nc8 to c5: c8, c7, c6, c5.\n\nWhat's on c7? b7 is a black pawn on b7, but c7 is empty?\n\nFrom FEN:\n- c8: Q\n- c7: empty (from 1p6 \u2014 b7 is pawn, c7 empty)\n- c6: empty (1q3pp1 \u2014 b6 is queen, c6 empty)\n- c5: king\n\nSo yes \u2014 **White queen on c8 is attacking c5 directly** \u2014 **Black king is in check**.\n\nTherefore, **Black must get out of check**.\n\nSo only legal moves are those that **remove the king from the c-file** or **block the check** or **capture the queen**.\n\nBut the queen is on c8 \u2014 can Black capture it?\n\n- Queen on b6 \u2014 can it go to c8? b6 to c8 is diagonal? b6 to c7 is diagonal, c7 to c8 is vertical \u2014 no, b6 to c8 is not a legal queen move \u2014 it's two squares up and one right \u2014 not straight.\n\nb6 to c8: \u0394file=+1, \u0394rank=+2 \u2014 not a valid queen move. So **cannot capture queen**.\n\nCan Black **block** the check?\n\nOnly if a piece can move to c6, c7, or c8.\n\nc8 is occupied by White queen \u2014 can't go there.\n\nc7: possible?\n\nWhich Black pieces can go to c7?\n\n- Queen on b6: b6 to c7 \u2014 yes, diagonal (b6\u2192c7) \u2014 one square up-right \u2014 valid.\n- Knight on d5: d5 to c7 \u2014 yes, L-shape: left 1, up 2 \u2014 d5\u2192c7 \u2014 yes.\n- King on c5: can't go to c6 because still on c-file and in check? c5 to c6 would still be on c-file \u2014 queen still attacks \u2014 so **illegal**.\n\nSo **blocking moves**:\n- b6c7 \u2014 queen blocks\n- d5c7 \u2014 knight blocks\n\n**King moves** \u2014 must get off the c-file:\n- c5d6 \u2014 to d6 \u2014 off c-file \u2014 is it safe?\n- c5b5 \u2014 to b5 \u2014 off c-file\n- c5b4 \u2014 to b4 \u2014 off c-file\n\nBut must not move into check.\n\nSo all king moves must be to safe squares.\n\nNow, let\u2019s analyze each legal move.\n\n---\n\n### **Step "
