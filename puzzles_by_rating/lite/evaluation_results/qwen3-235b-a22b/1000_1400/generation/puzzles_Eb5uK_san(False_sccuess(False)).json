If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n6k1/5p1p/6p1/4Q1P1/p7/4P3/q1r1BKP1/4R3 w - - 4 35\n```\n\nThis means:\n- It's **White to move**.\n- White has a queen on e5, bishop on e2, king on g2, rook on e1, pawn on e3 and g5.\n- Black has a queen on a2, rook on c2, pawns on a4, f7, g6, h7, and king on g8.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluate the position**\n\n**Material:**\n- White: Queen, Rook, Bishop, 2 pawns (e3, g5), King\n- Black: Queen, Rook, 4 pawns (a4, f7, g6, h7), King\n\nRoughly equal in material (both have queen + rook + pawns), but White has more active pieces.\n\n**King safety:**\n- White king on g2 is relatively safe.\n- Black king on g8 is exposed, especially with White\u2019s queen on e5 and bishop on e2 potentially aiming at the diagonal.\n\n**Threats:**\n- Black\u2019s queen on a2 is attacking White\u2019s rook on e2 and e3 pawn.\n- Black\u2019s rook on c2 is also attacking e2 and e3.\n- But White\u2019s queen on e5 is **very active**, deep in enemy territory.\n\n**White\u2019s queen on e5** is attacking:\n- h8 (empty, but check possible)\n- e8 (empty)\n- b8 (empty)\n- g7 (pawn)\n- e7 (f7 pawn)\n- c7 (empty)\n- f6, e6, d6 \u2014 all near king\n- Also controls the 5th rank and long diagonal.\n\nBut crucially: **Is the queen under threat?**\n- Black has no pieces attacking e5 directly.\n- Black\u2019s queen on a2 is too far.\n- Rook on c2 is on c-file.\n- So queen is safe for now.\n\nBut note: Black\u2019s queen on a2 is **forking** White\u2019s e2 bishop and e3 pawn. If White doesn\u2019t respond, Black may win material.\n\nHowever, White has a **tactical opportunity**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Look for tactical shots**\n\nLet\u2019s look at **checks and captures** first.\n\nWhite\u2019s queen on e5 has several checks:\n\n1. **e5-h8+?** \u2192 e5h8\n   - Qh8+! King must go to f8 or h7.\n   - After Kf8, what follows?\n     - Then Qh8+ forces king to f8, and now White can bring in other pieces.\n     - But is it winning?\n\nLet\u2019s calculate:\n\n**1. Qh8+ Kxh8?** \u2014 No, Black cannot capture because there\u2019s no piece on h8. So:\n- 1. Qh8+ Kf8\n- Now, is there a follow-up?\n\nWhite has bishop on e2, rook on e1, king on g2.\n\nCan we deliver mate?\n\nAfter Qh8+ Kf8, White can play **Bh5!** or **Rxe7**, but we don\u2019t have Bh5 as a move right now \u2014 we must play one move at a time.\n\nBut **Qh8+** is a check, and if it leads to forced mate, it\u2019s excellent.\n\nBut after 1. Qh8+ Kf8, Black is not mated. White can play Qh8+ and then maybe Rxe7 or Bg4, but Black has time to defend.\n\nAlso, **Qh8+ allows Black to play ...Qxe2!**, because White is moving the queen.\n\nWait \u2014 this is critical.\n\nIf White plays **e5h8 (Qh8+)**, then Black can reply:\n\n**1... Qxe2!**, attacking the rook on e1 and threatening mate on e1 or f1.\n\n- After Qxe2, White\u2019s king is on g2, rook on e1 is hanging.\n- If 2. KxQ, then Rxe2 \u2014 Black wins a piece.\n- Or if 2. Re1, Qf1+ 3. Kg3 Qg1+ etc. \u2014 messy.\n\nSo **Qh8+? allows Qxe2!** and Black wins material.\n\nSo **e5h8 is a blunder**.\n\nAvoid that.\n\n---\n\nWhat about **e5e8+**? Qe8+!\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n**1. Qe8+!**\n\n- If **Kg7**, then Qe7+ skewers king and rook? Wait:\n\nAfter 1. Qe8+ Kg7\n\nNow 2. Qe7+ forces Rf7, then Qxf7+ Kh6 \u2014 not great.\n\nBut better: after Qe8+, if Black plays **Kg7**, then **Bh5!** is a strong follow-up, threatening mate on g6.\n\nBut again, we must consider: **after Qe8+, can Black play Qxe2?**\n\nYes! Same issue.\n\n1. Qe8+ Kg7\n2. ... Qxe2! \u2014 again, winning the bishop.\n\nSo **any queen move off e5 allows Qxe2**, winning the bishop.\n\nTherefore, **moving the queen from e5 loses the bishop on e2**.\n\nSo **we cannot move the queen unless it gives checkmate or wins the game**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **Qe5-e6+** check?\n\ne6 is on the same file \u2014 e5 to e6 is not a check unless it attacks the king.\n\nKing is on g8, e6 is two squares away \u2014 no, **e5e6 is not a check**.\n\nOnly queen moves that are **checks** are:\n\n- e5h8 (h-file)\n- e5e8 (same file)\n- e5g7 (g7 is adjacent to g8 \u2014 yes, **Qg7#**?)\n\nWait \u2014 **e5g7** \u2014 is that check?\n\nQueen from e5 to g7: g7 is occupied by a black pawn.\n\nSo **e5g7** would be **Qxg7+**\n\nKing on g8 \u2014 yes, queen on g7 gives check.\n\nAnd is it **checkmate**?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n**1. Qxg7+!**\n\n- Kxg7? No \u2014 if king captures, it\u2019s Kxg7, but then **e5g7** is capture, so:\n\nAfter **Qxg7+**, Black **cannot** capture with king because then it would be **Kxg7**, but then White has **e5g7**, so:\n\nWait \u2014 no: **Qxg7+** means queen takes on g7 and gives check.\n\nSo:\n\n- King on g8\n- Queen moves to g7 \u2014 which is adjacent \u2014 so **Qg7+**\n\nNow, can Black capture?\n\n- Kxg7 \u2014 yes, king can capture the queen.\n\nBut then White has **e5g7**, so after **Kxg7**, White has no follow-up \u2014 but Black has just captured the queen.\n\nBut is there a **discovered attack**?\n\nWait \u2014 when White plays Qxg7+, is there a discovered check?\n\nNo \u2014 the queen is moving to g7, capturing a pawn, and giving check.\n\nAfter **1. Qxg7+ Kxg7**, Black has captured the queen.\n\nNow it\u2019s Black\u2019s turn.\n\nBut White has **e3-e4**, **Rook on e1**, **Bishop on e2**, **King on g2**.\n\nBlack has queen on a2, rook on c2, king on g7, pawns.\n\nBut now **White can play Rxe7+!**\n\nBecause after Kxg7, the e7 pawn is unprotected.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Qxg7+! Kxg7  \n2. Rxe7+! Kf8 (only move, Kh8? Rxe8+ wins)\n\nThen 3. Rxf7+! Ke8 (or Kg8 4. Re8+ Kf7 5. Rfe7+ etc.)\n\nBut let\u2019s see:\n\nAfter 2. Rxe7+ Kf8  \n3. Rxf7+! Kg8\n\nNow what?\n\nWhite has Rf7, but Black plays Qb2+ or something.\n\nBut White can play Bh5, threatening mate.\n\nBut is this winning?\n\nAlternatively, after 1. Qxg7+ Kxg7 2. Rxe7+ Kf8 3. Rxf7+ Kg8 4. Be4!\n\nNow threatening Rh7 or Bg6.\n\nBut Black has Qa1+ or Qb2, maybe drawing.\n\nBut we are down a queen for a rook and bishop \u2014 not good.\n\nSo **Qxg7+** leads to queen sacrifice, but not forced mate.\n\nAnd after Kxg7, Black is up material.\n\nSo **e5g7** is bad.\n\nWait \u2014 but what if **Black cannot capture**?\n\nIs **g7** defended?\n\nBlack has pawns on f7, g6, h7 \u2014 so g7 pawn is on g7.\n\nWhen White plays Qxg7+, the g7 pawn is captured.\n\nCan Black recapture with g6 pawn? No \u2014 g6 pawn is on g6,"
