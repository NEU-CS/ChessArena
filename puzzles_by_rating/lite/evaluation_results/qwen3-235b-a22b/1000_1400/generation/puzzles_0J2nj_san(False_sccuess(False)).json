(Black pawn on a7, h7)\n8     -> 6th rank: ........\n1p1k1K2 -> 5th rank: .p.k.K.. (Black pawn on b5, Black king on d5, White king on f5)\n2p3P1 -> 4th rank: ..p...P.

No pieces, only pawns and kings. White has 5 pawns, Black has 4. But pawns are scattered.\n\n**Key features:**\n- Kings are active. White king on f5 is quite advanced.\n- Black king on d5 is central.\n- Passed pawns? Let's see:\n  - White: \n    - a2: blocked by nothing? a7 is black pawn, but a-file: a2 (W), a7 (B) \u2014 not passed.\n    - c3: c4 has black pawn \u2014 blocked.\n    - f2: can advance? f-file open.\n    - g4: advanced, could push.\n    - h3: can push.\n  - Black:\n    - a7: isolated, could be a passer if supported?\n    - b5: might be a passer? c3 is white pawn, so b5 might be passed if c4 is gone? But c4 is black pawn \u2014 no, b5 is not passed.\n    - c4: isolated, could be passed? c3 is white pawn \u2014 so blocked.\n    - h7: isolated, but h-file: h3 (W), h7 (B) \u2014 not passed.\n\nBut note: **White has a potential passed pawn on the kingside** \u2014 with g4 and h3, and Black has only h7. If White can push g5 and h4, and king supports, it might create a passed pawn.\n\nAlso, **White king is very active** \u2014 on f5, close to the center and kingside.\n\nBlack king is on d5 \u2014 trying to stop White's king from penetrating or support its own pawns.\n\nBut look: **White can play f5-f6!**\n\nLet\u2019s analyze `f5f6`:\n\n### Candidate move: `f5f6`\n\nKing moves to f6.\n\nWhy is this strong?\n\n- King gets closer to the queenside? No, but it threatens to march to e7 or g7 and attack Black\u2019s pawns on a7 and h7.\n\nBut more importantly: **Can the White king penetrate?**\n\nAfter `f5f6`, Black king is on d5. Can it stop the White king?\n\nSuppose: 1. Kf6 Ke4 (trying to chase the king)\n\nBut White can play g5, h4, etc., and the king can go to g7, pick up h7, and promote.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: is f6 safe?\n\nIs the king exposed? f6 is not immediately attacked. No pieces, only pawns.\n\nBut more importantly: **Does Black have a counterplay?**\n\nBlack\u2019s pawns: a7, b5, c4.\n\nCan Black push anything?\n\nc4 is blocked by nothing? c3 is White pawn \u2014 so c4 is blocked.\n\nb5: can it advance? b4? But c3 is there \u2014 so if b4, cxb4 axb4, but White might not want that.\n\nBut Black\u2019s pawns are not dangerous.\n\nWhite\u2019s plan: use king to support g4-g5, h3-h4, and create a passed pawn on h-file or g-file.\n\nBut even better: **Can White king reach the queenside and eat a7?**\n\na7 is a weak pawn. But it's far.\n\nAlternatively, **can White promote first?**\n\nLet\u2019s see: if White plays Kf6, then g5, h4, f4, etc., can he create a passed pawn?\n\nBut Black might counter with ...b4 or ...c3?\n\nWait: c4-c3? c3 is occupied by White pawn.\n\nc4-c3 is not possible.\n\nb5-b4? If b4, cxb4 cxb4, then White has a passed pawn on b-file? No, White doesn't have a b-pawn.\n\nAfter b4, cxb4 cxb4: Black has b4 pawn, White has c3 pawn \u2014 so Black has a passed pawn on b4?\n\nWait: after b4, cxb4, then cxb4 \u2014 Black has pawn on b4, White has no b-pawn \u2014 so yes, **Black gets a passed b-pawn**.\n\nThat\u2019s dangerous.\n\nSo White must be careful not to allow ...b4.\n\nBut currently, b5 is blocked? By what? a2 is White pawn, but not on b-file.\n\nb5 can advance to b4 only if not blocked \u2014 and it's not blocked. So Black can play ...b4 at any time.\n\nBut if ...b4, then cxb4 cxb4 \u2014 Black has b4 passed pawn, and White has c3 pawn \u2014 so b4 is passed.\n\nThen Black king can support b4 to promote.\n\nSo **White must prevent ...b4** or be able to promote first.\n\nBut White is on move.\n\nSo if White plays slowly, Black can play ...b4 and create a dangerous passer.\n\nTherefore, **White must either prevent ...b4 or create a faster threat.**\n\nCan White king stop a b-pawn?\n\nFrom f5, it's far.\n\nBut if White plays `f5f6`, king goes to f6 \u2014 still far from queenside.\n\nAlternatively, **can White king go to e5 or d6 and cut off Black king?**\n\nWait \u2014 Black king is on d5.\n\nIf White plays `f5f6`, Black can play `...b4` immediately.\n\nAfter 1. Kf6 b4 2. cxb4 cxb4\n\nNow Black has a passed b-pawn on b4, and White has no immediate promotion.\n\nWhite can play g5, but Black plays b3, a6, etc., and the b-pawn might promote.\n\nWhite king is on f6 \u2014 too far to stop it.\n\nSo `f5f6` might allow ...b4 and a dangerous counterplay.\n\nWhat if White plays `f5g5`?\n\nKing to g5.\n\nNow king is on g5 \u2014 closer to g4 and h3.\n\nSupports h4 and g5-g6 if needed.\n\nBut does it stop ...b4? No.\n\nSame problem.\n\nBut perhaps White can create a **faster passed pawn on the kingside**.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the kingside:\n\nWhite: pawns on g4, h3, f2\nBlack: pawn on h7\n\nIf White plays g5, then h4"
