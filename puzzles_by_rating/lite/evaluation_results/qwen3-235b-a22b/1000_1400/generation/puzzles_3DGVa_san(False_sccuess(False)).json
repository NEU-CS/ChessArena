When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

No \u2014 e5 is on e5, d8 is on d8 \u2014 not aligned.\n- But e5 is **pinned**? Let's see: e5 is a rook. Is it pinned to the king? No \u2014 the king is on h2, so no immediate pin.\n- But wait: **Black bishop on d5 is attacking the e5 rook** \u2014 and e5 is defended only by the queen on c5.\n- So: **Bd5 attacks Re5**, and Re5 is defended by Qc5.\n- Qc5 is **undefended** \u2014 it's only on c5, not protected by any piece.\n\nSo: **If Black plays ...Bxe5, then Qxe5, but then Q is still hanging?** No \u2014 after Bxe5, Qxe5, white recaptures.\n\nBut more importantly: **White can win material immediately?**\n\nLet\u2019s look at **tactical opportunities**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Look for Tactics \u2014 Especially Queen Activity\n\nQueen on c5 is powerful:\n- Controls the long diagonal a3-f8.\n- Can attack along the 5th rank.\n- Can potentially **fork** or **skewer**.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **checks** and **captures**.\n\n#### Candidate Move: **c5f8+** \u2014 Queen to f8 with check?\n\n- Qxf8+? Is that possible?\n- f8 is occupied by **black king**? No \u2014 king is on g8.\n- f8 is currently **empty** \u2014 yes, from the board: 3r2k1 \u2192 so d8 is rook, e8 empty, f8 empty, g8 king, h8 empty.\n\nSo f8 is empty.\n\nCan Q go to f8?\n\n- c5 to f8: is that on a diagonal? c5 \u2192 d6 \u2192 e7 \u2192 f8: yes, diagonal.\n- So **c5f8** is a legal move.\n\nNow, is it check?\n\n- Q on f8, king on g8 \u2014 yes, adjacent files, same rank? No: f8 and g8 are adjacent squares \u2014 so **Qf8+ is check**.\n\nNow, what happens?\n\n- Black king is on g8.\n- Qf8+ attacks g8.\n- Can Black capture the queen? Only if a piece can take on f8.\n- Black has:\n  - Rook on d8 \u2014 can it take? d8 to f8 is two squares right \u2014 not a rook move unless along file or rank. d8-f8 is along the 8th rank \u2014 yes! d8 to f8 is horizontal.\n\nSo **Rd8 can capture Qf8**.\n\nSo: **1. Qxf8+ Rxf8** \u2014 and now White has given up the queen for a rook.\n\nIs that good? No \u2014 White was up material, but trading queen for rook is bad unless it leads to mate.\n\nAfter Qxf8+ Rxf8, we have:\n\n- White loses queen, gets a rook.\n- Material: White had Q + R + R + B + N vs R + B + pawns.\n- After trade: White has R + R + B + N vs R + B + pawns \u2014 so only one rook ahead, but Black has more pawns.\n\nNot clearly winning.\n\nBut more importantly: **after Qxf8+, Rxf8, is there a follow-up?**\n\nWhite has rook on e5 \u2014 can it do anything?\n\ne5 to e8+? Re8+? But e8 is now empty \u2014 yes.\n\nAfter Qxf8+ Rxf8, then **Re8+**?\n\n- Re8+ checks the king on g8.\n- King must go to h7 or f7.\n\nSay: Kh7.\n\nThen Re8 is attacking the rook on f8? No \u2014 f8 is occupied by black rook.\n\nRe8 and Rf8 are on same rank \u2014 so **pin? skewer?**\n\nActually: **Re8 attacks Rf8** \u2014 so it's a **skewer**: king behind rook.\n\nSo after:\n\n1. Qxf8+ Rxf8  \n2. Re8+ Kh7  \n3. Rxf8\n\nWhite wins the rook \u2014 so net result: **Queen for rook**, but then **win a second rook** \u2014 so **queen for two rooks**.\n\nBut two rooks are roughly equal to a queen \u2014 so even trade.\n\nBut White started with queen and two rooks \u2014 now has two rooks left.\n\nBlack has no rooks.\n\nBut Black has more pawns.\n\nSo not clearly better.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: is there **mate**?\n\nAfter Re8+ Kh7, can White play something else?\n\nBut no immediate mate.\n\nSo **Qxf8+** leads to queen for two rooks \u2014 roughly equal, but White was already up \u2014 so this **sacrifices advantage**.\n\nSo **not good**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **Qc8+** better?\n\nTry **c5c8+** \u2014 Qc8+.\n\n- Qc8+ checks the king on g8? c8 to g8 is along 8th rank \u2014 yes, horizontal.\n- So Qc8+ is check.\n\nCan Black capture? Only if rook on d8 takes \u2014 Rd8 to c8? Yes, along the rank.\n\nSo **Rd8xc8**.\n\nThen Qxc8+ \u2014 but queen is already captured.\n\nSo: 1. Qc8+ Rxc8 2. Rxc8\n\nSo again, **queen for rook** \u2014 same as before.\n\nNo gain.\n\nSo both Qf8+ and Qc8+ just trade queen for rook \u2014 not good.\n\nBut what if **Black cannot capture**?\n\nIn Qc8+, is there another king move?\n\nKing on g8 \u2014 can it move to f8?\n\ng8 to f8 \u2014 yes, adjacent.\n\nBut is f8 attacked?\n\nAfter Qc8+, king can go to f8?\n\nBut Qc8 attacks f8? c8 to f8 \u2014 diagonal? c8-d7-e6-f5 \u2014 no, not diagonal. c8 to f8 is three squares right \u2014 same rank? No, c8 and f8 are both on 8th rank \u2014 yes.\n\nSo Qc8 is on c8, f8 is three files right \u2014 so **Qc8 attacks along the 8th rank** \u2014 so yes, **Qc8 attacks f8**.\n\nSo king cannot go to f8 \u2014 only escape is h7 or h8.\n\nBut h8: is it attacked? Qc8 does not attack h8 \u2014 c8 to h8 is five files right \u2014 same rank \u2014 yes, it does attack h8.\n\nSo Qc8 attacks entire 8th rank \u2014 so **all squares on 8th rank are attacked**.\n\nSo king cannot go to f8, g8, h8 \u2014 only escape is **h7** or **f7**.\n\nSo after Qc8+, king must go to h7 or f7.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n1. Qc8+ Kh7\n\nNow, what"
