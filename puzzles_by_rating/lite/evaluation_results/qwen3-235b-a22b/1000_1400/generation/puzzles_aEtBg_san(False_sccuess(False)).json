When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/6Qp/3k4/3P4/2P3P1/1P2rB1K/5q2/8 w - - 1 44\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLet\u2019s first **visualize the position** based on the FEN:\n\n- **White pieces**:\n  - King: h3\n  - Queen: g7\n  - Bishop: f3\n  - Pawns: d5, c4, b3, g4\n\n- **Black pieces**:\n  - King: d6\n  - Rook: e3\n  - Queen: f2\n  - Pawn: h7\n\nCurrent move: White\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate the position\n\nWhite has a **very strong queen on g7**, attacking the h7-pawn and threatening mate ideas on h8 or along the back rank.\n\nBlack has:\n- Queen on f2 \u2014 attacking the white king on h3 (since f2-h4-h3 is diagonal), but h3 is protected by the bishop on f3.\n- Rook on e3 \u2014 attacking the bishop on f3 and potentially threatening mate on h3 if the bishop weren't there.\n- King on d6 \u2014 exposed, near the center.\n- Pawn on h7 \u2014 about to be captured.\n\nWhite\u2019s queen on g7 is **extremely powerful** \u2014 it controls the 7th and 8th ranks and can deliver checkmate if the black king can\u2019t escape.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **immediate tactical threats**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Look for immediate checkmates\n\nCan White deliver checkmate?\n\nTry **Qg7 \u2192 h8+**?\n\n- **g7h8**: Qxh8+?\n  - After Qxh8+, Black king on d6 is not in check.\n  - But is it check? No \u2014 h8 is a corner, and the queen on h8 checks along the h-file and 8th rank.\n  - King is on d6 \u2014 not on h-file or 8th rank. So **not check**.\n  - So g7h8 is just capturing the h7-pawn, but not a check.\n\nBut what about **Qg7 \u2192 g8+**?\n\n- **g7g8**: Qg8+?\n  - Queen moves to g8 \u2014 now checks the black king on d6? No.\n  - From g8, queen controls g-file and 8th rank.\n  - Black king is on d6 \u2014 not on g-file or 8th rank. So **not check**.\n\nWait \u2014 but what if the queen goes to **f8**?\n\n- **g7f8**: Qf8+?\n  - Queen on f8 \u2014 controls f-file and 8th rank.\n  - King on d6 \u2014 not on f-file or 8th rank. Still not in check.\n\nWait \u2014 is **any queen move from g7 giving check**?\n\nLet\u2019s reconsider.\n\nBlack king is on **d6**.\n\nQueen on g7 \u2014 can she check the king?\n\nOnly if she moves to a square that attacks d6.\n\nSquares that attack d6:\n- Along the d-file: d8, d7, d5, d4, etc.\n- Along the 6th rank: a6, b6, c6, e6, f6, g6, h6\n- Diagonals: from b1 to h7 diagonal \u2014 d6 is on c5-d6-e7-f8 and f4-e5-d6-c7-b8-a9, etc.\n\nSo queen on g7 can reach d6 via:\n- Diagonal: g7 \u2192 f6 \u2192 e5 \u2192 d4 \u2014 not d6.\n- g7 to d4? That\u2019s a diagonal, but d4 is not d6.\n\nWait \u2014 **g7 to e5**? That\u2019s on the same diagonal as d6? Let\u2019s see:\n\n- g7 (light square), e5 is also light square \u2014 yes, same diagonal.\n- g7 to e5: passes through f6 \u2014 yes, g7-f6-e5.\n- e5 to d6 is one square diagonally \u2014 so yes, queen on e5 attacks d6.\n\nSo **Qe5+** is a check.\n\nBut is that in the legal moves?\n\nLegal moves include: **g7e5**\n\nYes! `g7e5` is in the list.\n\nSo **Qe5+** checks the black king.\n\nBut is that the best?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps there\u2019s a **forced mate**.\n\nLet\u2019s look again.\n\nWhat happens if White plays **Qg7 \u2192 g6+**?\n\nWait \u2014 `g7g6` is in the list.\n\nQueen to g6: is that check?\n\ng6 \u2014 same rank as black king (d6 is on 6th rank). So yes! Queen on g6 is on the 6th rank, king on d6 \u2014 so **Qg6+** is check!\n\nIs that possible?\n\nYes \u2014 `g7g6` is a legal move.\n\nSo **Qg6+** checks the black king.\n\nNow, what are Black\u2019s replies?\n\nAfter **Qg6+**, king on d6 must move.\n\nAvailable squares:\n- d7? \u2014 attacked by queen on g6 (diagonal g6-f7-e8? no \u2014 g6 to d7 is g6-f7-e8, not d7. d7 is dark, g6 is light \u2014 no. So d7 is safe?\nWait \u2014 queen on g6 controls:\n- g-file\n- 6th rank\n- Diagonals: from a1 to h8 \u2014 g6 is on that diagonal (a1-h8), so squares like f5, e4, d3, c2, b1 and h7.\n\nAlso the other diagonal: g6-f7-e8 \u2014 so f7, e8.\n\nSo d7 is **not** attacked.\n\nSo king can go to **d7**.\n\nAlso:\n- c6? \u2014 on 6th rank \u2014 attacked by Qg6.\n- c5? \u2014 not on same file/rank/diagonal? c5 is on diagonal with g6? g6-f5-e4-d3-c2 \u2014 no. g6 to c5 is not aligned. So c5 is safe?\nWait \u2014 queen on g6, c5: difference in file: 4, rank: 1 \u2014 not same diagonal. So no.\n\nBut c6 is on 6th rank \u2014 attacked.\n\nd5? \u2014 on d-file, but queen doesn't control d-file. d5 is not on same diagonal? g6-e4-d3 \u2014 no. So d5 is safe?\n\nBut d5 is occupied by white pawn.\n\nSo king can go to:\n- d7\n- c7? \u2014 c7: not on 6th rank, not on g-file. Diagonally? g6-f7-e8 \u2014 no. g6 to c7: g6-f7-e8 \u2014 not c7. c7 is dark, g6 is light \u2014 no. So c7 is safe?\nBut c7 is attacked by queen? No.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is c7 attacked by anything else?\n\nWhite has a queen on g6, but not attacking c7.\n\nBut **b3-b4** is a legal move \u2014 so b3 pawn is on b3.\n\nBut no immediate threat.\n\nSo after **Qg6+**, king goes to d7.\n\nThen White can play **Qf7+**, forking king and possibly mating.\n\nBut let\u2019s see if there\u2019s a **quicker mate**.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **Qg7 \u2192 f7+**?\n\nIs `g7f7` in the list? Yes.\n\n**Qf7+** \u2014 queen to f7.\n\nIs that check?\n\nf7 \u2014 same file as king? No. Same rank? f7 is 7th rank, king on d6 \u2014 6th.\n\nDiagonally? f7 to d5? f7-e6-d5 \u2014 not d6. d6 is one square up.\n\nf7 to d6? f7-e6-d5 \u2014 no, not aligned.\n\nf7 is on the a2-g8 diagonal: f7-e6-d5-c4-b3-a2.\n\nd6 is not on that.\n\nSo **Qf7 does not attack d6** \u2014 so not check.\n\nSo Qf7 is not check.\n\nBut what about **Qe7+**?\n\n`g7e7` \u2014 queen to e7.\n\ne7 \u2014 same rank as 7th, king on d6.\n\nDiagonally: e7-d6 \u2014 yes! e7 to d6 is one diagonal square.\n\nSo **Qe7+** is check!\n\nYes \u2014 e7 is light square, d6 is dark \u2014 wait! **d6 is dark**, e7 is light \u2014 so not same diagonal.\n\nWait \u2014 e7 is light square (e-file, 7th rank: e1 is dark, so e7 is light), d6 is dark (d1 is light, d6 is dark).\n\nSo e7 and d6 are **different colors** \u2014 cannot be on same diagonal.\n\nSo **Qe7 does not attack d6**.\n\nSo not check.\n\nBack to **Qg6+** \u2014 that is check, as it attacks along the 6th rank.\n\nBut after Kd7, White plays Qf7+?\n\nQf7+ \u2014 now, f7 to d5? Not d6.\n\nWait \u2014 f7 to d6? f7-e6-d5 \u2014 no.\n\nBut f7 to d6"
