P . . . g p .\n  5 | . . . . p K . .\n  4 | . . . k P . g .\n  3 | . . . . . . . .\n  2 | . . . . . . . .\n  1 | . . . . . . . .\n      a b c d e f g h\n  ```\n\n- **White to move** (`w`)\n- No castling rights, no en passant\n- Move count: 41\n\n### Step 2: Identify key pieces\n\n- **White King**: f5\n- **White pawns**: b6, e4, g4\n- **Black King**: d4\n- **Black pawns**: b7, f6, g6, e5\n\nNote: The pawn on g6 is black (from 6th rank), and g7 is empty.\n\nWait \u2014 let's double-check the 6th rank: `1P3pp1` \u2192 b6 is white pawn, then three empty, then f6 and g6 are black pawns.\n\nSo:\n- White: pawns on b6, e4, g4; king on f5\n- Black: pawns on b7, e5, f6, g6; king on d4\n\n### Step 3: Legal moves provided\n\nOnly three legal moves:\n- `f5g6` \u2014 King takes on g6\n- `f5f6` \u2014 King moves to f6\n- `f5e6` \u2014 King moves to e6\n\nWhy only these? Because the white king is on f5 and is surrounded. Let\u2019s verify:\n\n- f5 is adjacent to: e5 (occupied by black pawn), e4 (white pawn), f4 (empty?), g4 (white pawn), g5 (empty?), e6, f6, g6, and g5.\n\nWait \u2014 let's check what squares are occupied.\n\nFrom the board:\n- e5: black pawn\n- e4: white pawn\n- g4: white pawn\n- f6: black pawn\n- g6: black pawn\n- d4: black king\n- d5: empty?\n\nSo king on f5 can move to:\n- e5 \u2192 occupied by black pawn \u2192 can capture? But not in legal moves list \u2192 so maybe not allowed? But wait, `f5e5` is not in the list.\n\nBut the legal moves are only:\n- f5g6\n- f5f6\n- f5e6\n\nSo:\n- `f5g6`: king captures black pawn on g6\n- `f5f6`: king moves to f6 (black pawn there?)\n- `f5e6`: king to e6\n\nBut f6 has a black pawn \u2014 so `f5f6` would be a capture.\n\nSimilarly, e6 is empty? Let's check.\n\ne6: rank 6, file e \u2192 between d6 and f6. From FEN: 6th rank is `1P3pp1` \u2192 so:\n- a6: empty\n- b6: white pawn\n- c6: empty\n- d6: empty\n- e6: empty\n- f6: black pawn\n- g6: black pawn\n- h6: empty\n\nSo e6 is empty. So `f5e6` is a quiet move.\n\nf6 has a black pawn, so `f5f6` is a capture.\n\ng6 has a black pawn, so `f5g6` is a capture.\n\nSo all three are captures or moves into empty squares.\n\nNow, why can't the king go to e5? e5 has a black pawn. But `f5e5` is not in the list. Is e5 attacked or is the pawn defended?\n\ne5: black pawn. Is it defended? By whom?\n\n- Black king is on d4 \u2014 it attacks c5, d5, e5, c4, e4, c3, d3, e3. So yes, **e5 is defended by the black king**.\n\nSo if White plays `f5e5`, he captures the pawn, but black king can recapture: Kd4xe5.\n\nBut is that favorable?\n\nBut `f5e5` is not in the legal moves list \u2014 so perhaps the engine or problem says only these three are legal. So we must assume that `f5e5` is not legal \u2014 but that would only be if it's an illegal move (e.g., leaves king in check). But no checks here.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the move `f5e5` is not considered because it's not in the list \u2014 but the user says \"Legal moves in UCI notation: f5g6, f5f6, f5e6\"\n\nSo we must assume these are the only legal moves \u2014 perhaps due to some constraint, but more likely, the position or move generator has filtered correctly.\n\nBut let's assume the list is correct: only three legal moves.\n\nSo we must choose among:\n1. `f5g6` \u2014 Kxg6\n2. `f5f6` \u2014 Kxf6\n3. `f5e6` \u2014 Ke6\n\n### Step 4: Analyze each move\n\n---\n\n#### **Option 1: f5g6 (Kxg6)**\n\nWhite king captures the black pawn on g6.\n\nNow:\n- White king on g6\n- Black to move\n- Black has pawns on f6, e5, b7; king on d4; white has pawns on b6, e4, g4\n\nAfter Kxg6, black can play:\n- **f6f5!** \u2014 pushing the f-pawn, attacking the king?\n\nWait: f6-f5 would be a pawn push from f6 to f5 \u2014 but that\u2019s backward. No, pawns move forward.\n\nBlack pawns move **up** the board (from rank 7 to rank 8).\n\nSo black pawns on f6 and g6 \u2014 but g6 is gone. f6 is still there.\n\nAfter Kxg6, the f6 pawn is still on f6.\n\nCan black push f6-f5? No \u2014 black pawns move from rank 6 to 5? No, **black pawns move down**.\n\nStandard: black pawns move from higher rank to lower, so from rank 6 to 5 is forward.\n\nYes: f6 to f5 is a legal pawn move.\n\nBut f5 is occupied? No \u2014 f5 is where the white king was. Now the king is on g6.\n\nf5 is empty.\n\nSo after 1. Kxg6, Black can play **f6-f5!**, attacking the e4 pawn?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- f6-f5: pawn moves to f5, now attacks e4 (diagonally).\n\ne4 is a white pawn.\n\nSo now, if White doesn\u2019t respond, Black can play f5xe4.\n\nBut more importantly, what about the kings?\n\nBlack king is on d4, can it get active?\n\nBut more critical: **can Black promote?**\n\nBlack has a b7 pawn. White has a b6 pawn.\n\nb7-b5-b4-b3-b2-b1=Q \u2014 but white b6 pawn is in the way?\n\nb6 is white, b7 is black \u2014 so black pawn on b7, white pawn on b6 \u2014 they are on adjacent files? No, same file?\n\nb7 and b6 \u2014 same file.\n\nSo black pawn on b7, white pawn on b6 \u2014 so black pawn is blocked.\n\nSo the **b7 pawn is blocked by the b6 pawn** \u2014 cannot move.\n\nSo Black has no passed pawn on the queenside.\n\nOn the kingside:\n- After 1. Kxg6, Black plays **f6-f5!**\n\nNow:\n- f5 pawn attacks e4\n- e5 pawn is still there\n- White has e4 pawn, which is now attacked by f5 pawn\n\nSo if Black plays f5xe4, then e4 is gone.\n\nBut more importantly, can Black create a passed pawn?\n\nAfter f5, then e5-e4, etc.\n\nBut let\u2019s see king activity.\n\nWhite king is on g6 \u2014 quite far from the center.\n\nBlack king can go to d4-e4? e4 might be contested.\n\nBut more importantly: **after Kxg6, Black can play f6-f5, and then e5-e4, creating a strong pawn center?**\n\nBut let\u2019s consider **zugzwang** or **king penetration**.\n\nAlternatively, is there a **pawn race**?\n\nBut more importantly: **is Kxg6 losing?**\n\nWait \u2014 after 1. Kxg6, Black plays **f6-f5!**, and now:\n\n- The f5 pawn attacks e4\n- Black can follow with e5-e4 if e4 is captured or moves\n- But also, the black king can march to e3 or f4?\n\nBut White king is on g6 \u2014 very far.\n\nBut White has a b6 pawn \u2014 can it promote?\n\nb6-b7-b8=Q"

But b7 is one step closer to promotion (b7 to b1 = 6 moves, b6 to b1 = 5 moves). However, **White is to move**, so White can potentially promote first if race continues.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is the b-pawn race even the main issue?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **kings and central pawns**.\n\nWhite king is on f6, black king on e4. They are close to the e5 and g6 pawns.\n\nBut more importantly: **White has a pawn on g4**, black on g6. So black's g6 pawn is blocked.\n\nWhite can push g4-g5 to challenge.\n\nBut the **most critical factor** is the **White king's proximity to the black pawns**.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **e5 pawn** \u2014 it's on e5, undefended.\n\nCan White capture it?\n\nKing on f6 \u2014 can it go to e6, f7, etc.?\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Legal Moves\n\nList of legal moves:\n1. **f6g7** \u2014 King takes g6 pawn\n2. **f6f7** \u2014 King to f7\n3. **f6e7** \u2014 King to e7\n4. **f6g6** \u2014 King to g6\n5. **f6e6** \u2014 King to e6\n6. **f6g5** \u2014 King to g5\n7. **g4g5** \u2014 Pawn pushes to g5\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **f6g7** \u2014 Kxg7\n\nKing takes the g6 pawn.\n\nAfter **f6g7**, position:\n- White king on g7\n- Black king on e4\n- Black has pawns: b7, e5\n- White has pawns: b6, g4\n\nNow Black can play **...e5-e4**, advancing the e-pawn.\n\nBut more importantly, **Black can play ...Kf4**, centralizing and threatening g4.\n\nBut White can respond with h2-h4? No, no h-pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 after **Kg7**, Black plays **...Kf4**, attacking g4.\n\nThen **g4-g5+**, but then ...Kxg5, and White king is stuck on g7.\n\nMeanwhile, **...b7-b5**, and the b-pawn starts rolling.\n\nWhite king is on g7 \u2014 very far from queenside.\n\nBlack can promote the b-pawn.\n\nSo **f6g7** looks **bad** \u2014 it allows the b-pawn to roll with no opposition.\n\nWhite king is too far to stop b7-b5-b4-b3-b2-b1=Q.\n\nSo **f6g7?** \u2014 likely losing.\n\nAvoid.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **f6f7** \u2014 Kf7\n\nKing moves to f7.\n\nNow king is on f7, still near center.\n\nBlack can play **...e5-e4**, and if Kf7-e6, then ...Kd4, etc.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t make progress.\n\nAlso, king on f7 is not helping on queenside, and not stopping e5.\n\nNo immediate threat.\n\nBut not clearly better than other moves.\n\nHold judgment.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **f6e7** \u2014 Ke7\n\nKing goes to e7.\n\nNow threatens to take e5: next move Ke7xe5.\n\nBut after **f6e7**, Black can play **...Kd4**, attacking b6.\n\nBecause now the b6 pawn is undefended!\n\nWhite played Ke7, so b6 is hanging.\n\nSo after **f6e7??**, Black plays **...Kd4**, then **...Kxb6**, winning the pawn.\n\nWhite cannot stop it.\n\nSo **f6e7??** loses a pawn \u2014 **blunder**.\n\nAvoid.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **f6g6** \u2014 Kg6\n\nKing moves to g6.\n\nNow, similar to f6g7, but not capturing.\n\nBut now, White king is on g6, protecting g4 pawn.\n\nBlack king on e4.\n\nNow, White can support g4-g5 later.\n\nBut also, king is closer to center.\n\nBut not capturing g6 pawn \u2014 why?\n\nBecause after **f6g6**, Black can play **...e5-e4**, and if Kf6, then ...Kd4 again?\n\nWait \u2014 after **f6g6**, the b6 pawn is still on b6 \u2014 is it defended?\n\nYes \u2014 by no one? King moved from f6 to g6 \u2014 b6 is still defended by **nobody**?\n\nWait \u2014 **b6 pawn**: who defends it?\n\nOriginally, only the king was near, but king was on f6 \u2014 too far.\n\nIs b6 defended at all?\n\nNo! The b6 pawn is **undefended**.\n\nSo if White plays **any king move that doesn't defend b6**, Black can play **...Kd4**, then **...Kxb6**, winning the pawn.\n\nSo after **f6g6**, Black plays **...Kd4**, then ...Kxb6.\n\nSame issue.\n\nSo **f6g6??** also loses the b-pawn.\n\nSimilarly, **f6f7**, **f6e6**, **f6g5**, **f6e7**, **f6g7** \u2014 all king moves away from b6?\n\nWait \u2014 is the b6 pawn really **undefended**?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check.\n\nWhite pawn on b6.\n\nIs any White piece attacking b6?\n\nNo other pawns or pieces.\n\nKing was on f6 \u2014 distance from f6 to b6 is 4 files apart \u2014 not defending.\n\nSo **b6 is undefended**.\n\nTherefore, **any king move allows ...Kd4 and ...Kxb6**, unless the king move keeps b6 defended.\n\nBut **no king move from f6 defends b6** \u2014 because b6 is on b6, king is on f6 \u2014 too far.\n\nSo **all king moves lose the b6 pawn**?\n\nBut that can\u2019t be \u2014 because then White is lost.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is that true?\n\nAfter **any** White king move, Black plays **...Kd4**, then **...Kxb6**.\n\nYes \u2014 unless White can recapture or prevent.\n\nBut there\u2019s no piece to recapture.\n\nSo if Black takes b6, White has no way to win it back.\n\nSo **White must not allow ...Kd4**.\n\nBut after any king move, Black can play ...Kd4 immediately.\n\nUnless White\u2019s move **threatens something more urgent**, like **promotion or checkmate**, forcing Black to respond.\n\nSo the only way to play a king move is if it creates a **stronger threat** than losing the b6 pawn.\n\nFor example, if White can **promote a pawn or force a win** faster than Black can take b6 and promote the b-pawn.\n\nSo let\u2019s evaluate:\n\n- Black b-pawn: b7 to b1 = 6 moves (b7-b6-b5-b4-b3-b2-b1)\n- But after ...Kd4, ...Kxb6, then ...b5, etc., it takes time.\n\nBut White has **no pawns near promotion** except b6 \u2014 which is White\u2019s own pawn.\n\nWhite\u2019s b6 pawn: b6 to b7 to b8 ="

But in the current FEN, f6 has a **king**, not a pawn.\n\nAh \u2014 this suggests that the **white king moved from f5 to f6** on the previous move. So the `f5f6` in the move history is **Kf5-f6**, not a pawn.\n\nSo current position:\n\n- White king: f6\n- Black king: f4\n- White pawns: b6, g5\n- Black pawns: b7, e5, g6\n\nBut wait \u2014 g6 has a black pawn, and g5 has a white pawn. So pawns are blocked on the g-file.\n\nWhite\u2019s b6-pawn is a passed pawn, one square away from queening (b7), but black has a pawn on b7? No \u2014 b7 is a **black pawn**, so it's on the 7th rank. That means **Black\u2019s b7-pawn is one square from promoting** too!\n\nWait \u2014 that can't be. If it's Black's pawn on b7, and it's Black's turn? No \u2014 it's **White to move**.\n\nBut if Black has a pawn on b7, and it hasn't moved, it could promote next move if not stopped.\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check:\n\n- **b7**: black pawn (from FEN: `1p6` on 7th rank)\n- **b6**: white pawn\n- So they are **adjacent** \u2014 not passed. In fact, they are **blocked**.\n\nSo:\n\n- b6 (White pawn) vs b7 (Black pawn) \u2014 but pawns move forward, so:\n  - White pawn on b6 wants to go to b7, but it's occupied by a black pawn \u2014 so **cannot advance**\n  - Black pawn on b7 wants to go to b8 \u2014 it can promote next move if given the chance.\n\nSo **Black is one move away from queening** if White doesn\u2019t prevent it.\n\nBut it\u2019s **White to move** \u2014 so White has a chance to prevent ...b7-b8=Q.\n\nBut can Black even move their b7 pawn? It\u2019s on b7, and it\u2019s Black\u2019s pawn. On their turn, they could play ...b8=Q, unless it\u2019s blocked or pinned.\n\nBut currently, it\u2019s **White\u2019s turn**, so Black hasn\u2019t moved yet.\n\nSo **if White does nothing about the b7 pawn, Black will play ...b8=Q next move and promote**.\n\nBut is the b7 pawn able to move?\n\nYes \u2014 unless it\u2019s **blocked**. The square b8 is empty (FEN shows 8th rank is empty), so **b7-b8=Q is legal for Black next move**.\n\nTherefore, **White must prevent ...b8=Q**.\n\nHow?\n\nOnly way is to **capture on b7**.\n\nBut does White have a piece that can capture on b7?\n\nWhite has:\n- King on f6\n- Pawn on b6\n- Pawn on g5\n\nOnly the **king** can potentially reach b7 \u2014 but it\u2019s very far.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the **b6 pawn** is on b6, adjacent to b7. But it can\u2019t capture upward \u2014 pawns capture diagonally.\n\nSo b6 pawn cannot capture on b7 \u2014 it\u2019s directly in front.\n\nSo **no White piece can capture on b7**.\n\nTherefore, **White cannot prevent ...b8=Q** unless the b7 pawn is **blocked** or **pinned**, but it\u2019s not.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is the b7 pawn **free to move**?\n\nYes \u2014 unless it\u2019s **pinned** or the square b8 is attacked.\n\nBut b8 is not attacked by White \u2014 no White piece controls b8.\n\nSo **Black will promote next move unless White can do something now**.\n\nBut White moves now \u2014 so after White moves, Black plays ...b8=Q.\n\nSo **unless White can deliver checkmate in one move**, or **force a draw**, White is lost.\n\nBut let\u2019s check: can White **capture the b7 pawn**?\n\nOnly if a piece can go to b7.\n\nWhite\u2019s king is on f6 \u2014 too far.\n\nNo other pieces.\n\nSo **White cannot stop ...b8=Q**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is the b7 pawn actually **Black\u2019s**? Yes, from FEN.\n\nBut if Black promotes, they get a queen \u2014 likely winning.\n\nBut perhaps White can **counter-promote** or create a **stalemate** or **king activity**?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s look at the **g-file**.\n\nWhite has pawn on g5, Black has pawn on g6 \u2014 so they are **blocked**.\n\ne5 has a black pawn \u2014 isolated.\n\nWhite king on f6, Black king on f4.\n\nNow, the **legal moves** are:\n\n- `f6g7`\n- `f6f7`\n- `f6e7`\n- `f6g6`\n- `f6e6`\n\nAll are **king moves** from f6.\n\nSo White must move the king.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each:\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Legal Move\n\n#### 1. `f6g7` \u2014 Kg7\n\nKing moves to g7.\n\n- Attacks h7, h8, f7, g6, f6\n- g6 has a black pawn \u2014 so now **attacking g6 pawn**\n- But what about b7? Still can\u2019t stop promotion.\n- After `f6g7`, Black plays `b7b8q` \u2014 queens.\n- Then Black has a queen, White has no queen \u2014 likely lost.\n- Also, king on g7 is near black pawns \u2014 but not helping on queenside.\n- **No benefit** \u2014 allows promotion.\n\n#### 2. `f6f7` \u2014 Kf7\n\nKing to f7.\n\n- Now on f7, still far from b-file.\n- Black plays `b7b8q` \u2014 queens.\n- White cannot stop it.\n- King on f7 may help support g5 or attack g6, but irrelevant.\n- Still loses.\n\n#### 3. `f6e7` \u2014 Ke7\n\nKing to e7.\n\n- Closer to center, but still far from b8.\n- Black promotes: `b7b8q`\n- No prevention.\n\n#### 4. `f6g6` \u2014 Kg6\n\nKing to g6.\n\n- g6 has a **black pawn** \u2014 so this is a **capture**: Kxg6\n- So `f6g6` = Kxg6\n\nAfter this move:\n- White captures the g6 pawn\n- Now White has pawns on b6, g5; king on g6\n- Black has pawns on b7, e5; king on f4\n\nNow, it\u2019s Black\u2019s turn.\n\nCan Black play `b7b8q`?\n\nYes \u2014 unless the square b8 is attacked or the pawn is blocked.\n\nb8 is empty, not attacked \u2014 so yes, Black can promote.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after `f6g6`, is there **check** or something?\n\nNo.\n\nSo Black plays `b7b8q`, queens.\n\nNow Black has a queen.\n\nBut now White might have a **counter-threat**?\n\nWhite king is on g6, Black king on f4.\n\nAfter ...b8=Q, White can play g"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/1p6/1P4K1/6P1/4pk2/8/8/8 w - - 0 44\n```\n\nAnd the legal moves:\n- `g6h7`\n- `g6g7`\n- `g6f7`\n- `g6h6`\n- `g6f6`\n- `g6h5`\n\nWe are playing **White**, and it's our turn (indicated by `w` in FEN).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Position\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the board from the FEN:\n\n```\n8th rank: 8        \u2192 empty\n7th rank: 1p6      \u2192 one square empty, then black pawn on b7, 6 empty\n6th rank: 1P4K1    \u2192 b6: White pawn, g6: White king\n5th rank: 6P1      \u2192 g5: White pawn\n4th rank: 4pk2    \u2192 e4: black pawn, f4: black king, rest empty\n3rd rank: 8        \u2192 empty\n2nd rank: 8        \u2192 empty\n1st rank: 8        \u2192 empty\n```\n\nSo the key pieces:\n\n- **White**:\n  - King on g6\n  - Pawn on b6 and g5\n- **Black**:\n  - King on f4\n  - Pawn on e4\n  - Pawn on b7\n\nWait \u2014 the black pawn on b7 is on the 7th rank. That means it's one square away from queening.\n\nBut White has a pawn on b6, which is blocking it.\n\nSo we have:\n\n- **White king** on g6\n- **Black king** on f4\n- **White pawn** on g5\n- **Black pawn** on e4\n- **White pawn** on b6\n- **Black pawn** on b7\n\nWhite to move.\n\nBut the legal moves are only king moves from g6: all starting with `g6...`\n\nSo the White king is on g6, and can go to:\n- `g6h7`, `g6g7`, `g6f7`, `g6h6`, `g6f6`, `g6h5`\n\nNo pawn moves are listed \u2014 so we must be in a position where only the king can move.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check the pawn on g5: it's on g5, so it can go to g6 \u2014 but g6 is occupied by the king. So no pawn moves possible.\n\nSimilarly, b6 pawn is blocked by b7 pawn.\n\nSo only king moves are available.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Position\n\n**Goal**: Win or draw? We must assess.\n\nWhite has:\n- King on g6\n- Pawns on b6 and g5\n\nBlack has:\n- King on f4\n- Pawns on e4 and b7\n\nWhite\u2019s b6 pawn is **blocking** black\u2019s b7 pawn from promoting. So if White ever moves the b6 pawn, black plays ...b5-b4-b3-b2-b1=Q and promotes.\n\nSo **b6 pawn must not move** \u2014 it\u2019s a **blockading pawn**, holding the b7 pawn.\n\nSo only active pieces are the kings and the e4 and g5 pawns.\n\nWhite\u2019s plan: try to support the g5 pawn to promote? But g5 is on g5, needs to go g6, g7, g8.\n\nBut g6 is currently occupied by the White king.\n\nSo if the king moves away, White can play g5-g6.\n\nBut we must be careful: Black king is on f4, which is close.\n\nLet\u2019s see the pawn race:\n\n- If White plays g5-g6, then g6-g7, g7-g8=Q \u2014 that\u2019s two moves after g6 is cleared.\n- But Black can advance e4-e3-e2-e1=Q \u2014 that\u2019s three moves.\n- But Black king can also interfere.\n\nBut more importantly: **if White king leaves g6, Black may be able to capture the g5 pawn?**\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\nBlack king is on f4.\n\nFrom f4, it can go to e5, f5, g5, e4, etc.\n\ng5 is occupied by a White pawn.\n\nSo if the White king is not on g6 or h5 or h6, can Black king capture on g5?\n\nYes: from f4 \u2192 g5 is a legal king move.\n\nSo **g5 pawn is currently protected only by the king on g6**.\n\nTherefore, if the White king moves away from g6, and does **not** protect g5, Black can play ...Kf4-g5, capturing the pawn.\n\nSo we **must not** move the king to a square that doesn\u2019t protect g5, unless we are promoting or forcing a win.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each legal move:\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Legal Move\n\n#### 1. `g6h7`\n- King to h7\n- Now g5 pawn is **unprotected**\n- Black plays ...Kf4-g5, captures g5 pawn\n- Then White has no real threats; Black can push e4-e3, etc.\n- Also, b6 pawn is still blockading, but no progress\n- After ...Kxg5, Black king is active, and White has no pawns advancing\n- Likely draw or even losing if Black promotes b-pawn later\n- **Too passive, loses g5 pawn for nothing**\n\u2192 **Bad**\n\n#### 2. `g6g7`\n- King to g7\n- Now g5 pawn is **unprotected**\n- Black plays ...Kf4-g5, captures g5\n- Same as above \u2014 White loses g5 pawn, no compensation\n- King on g7 is stuck, can\u2019t help on queenside\n\u2192 **Bad**\n\n#### 3. `g6f7`\n- King to f7\n- Again, g5 pawn is **not protected** (f7 does not guard g5)\n- Black plays ...Kf4-g5, takes pawn\n- White king is now on f7, far from both pawns\n- Black can push e4-e3 or go after b6\n- **Loses g5 pawn, king misplaced**\n\u2192 **Bad**\n\n#### 4. `g6h6`\n- King to h6\n- Does h6 protect g5? Yes \u2014 h6 is adjacent to g5\n- So g5 pawn is **still protected**\n- Black cannot take on g5\n- Now White threatens to play g5-g6 next move, advancing the pawn\n- Also, king is moving toward the g-file, supporting promotion\n- Is there any danger?\n  - Black plays ...Kf4-f5? Then Kxg5? But g5 is protected\n  - So ...Kf5 is met with g5-g6, and pawn advances\n  - If Black tries ...Kf4-e5, same idea: g5-g6\n- Also, White king is staying in contact with the g5 pawn\n- This move **maintains protection** and **prepares g5-g6**\n\u2192 **Good**\n\n#### 5. `g6f6`\n- King to f6\n- f6 protects g5? Yes \u2014 f6 is adjacent to g5\n- So g5 pawn is still protected\n- Now White threatens g5-g6\n- King is closer to the center\n- Also, king is closer to the e4 pawn \u2014 can it help stop e4?\n  - Black plays ...e4-e3, then e3-e2, e2-e1=Q\n  - But White might not have time\n- But more importantly: after `g6f6`, Black can play ...Kf4-e4!\n  - Attacking the e4 pawn? No \u2014 e4 is Black\u2019s own pawn\n  - Wait: Black king on f4 to e4 \u2014 that\u2019s just moving\n  - But e4 pawn is on e4, so Ke4 is fine\n  - But now White plays g5-g6\n  - Black can play ...e4-e3\n  - White: g6-g7, Black: e3-e2, White: g7-g8=Q, Black: e2-e1=Q \u2192 draw?\n  - But White might have a faster win?\n\nWait \u2014 but after `g6f6`, Black can play ...Kf4-g4!\n- Then if White plays g5-g6, Black plays ...Kg4xg5!\n- But is g5 protected? King on f6 protects g5 \u2014 yes!\n- So ...Kg4xg5 is not allowed \u2014 g5 is defended\n\nSo Black cannot capture.\n\nBut ...Kg4 puts pressure.\n\nStill, White can play g5-g6 safely.\n\nBut compare `g6f6` vs `g6h6`:\n\n- `g6h6` keeps king on the kingside, ready to support g7-g8\n- `g6f6` brings king toward center, maybe to help with e-file?\n\nBut e4 pawn: can White king stop it?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAfter `g6f6`, Black plays ...e4-e3\nWhite: g5-g6, Black: e3-e2\nWhite: g6-g7, Black: e2-e1=Q\nWhite: g7-g8=Q\n\nDrawn.\n\nBut if White king is on f6, can it help?\n\nAfter ...e2-e1="

Black has a king on f4 (central, active), pawns on e3 and b7.\n\nWhite\u2019s goal: promote a pawn or stop Black\u2019s pawns while advancing own.\n\nNote:\n- The b6 pawn is **blocked** by the b7 pawn. But b6 is a **passed pawn** if b7 moves or is captured.\n- The g5 pawn is on g5, could advance to g6 or g7.\n- White king is on h6 \u2014 very close to promoting via h7 and h8!\n- Black king is on f4 \u2014 far from the kingside, but can potentially race to stop promotions.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is the g5 pawn able to advance?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **legal moves** provided:\n\n- h6h7\n- h6g7\n- h6g6\n- h6h5\n- g5g6\n\nSo only these are legal. That tells us a lot.\n\nWhy is only **g5g6** the only pawn move? That means the other pawns (b6, e3, b7) must not have legal moves \u2014 likely because they are blocked.\n\nSo:\n- b6 cannot move (probably blocked by b7)\n- e3 cannot move? But it's on e3 \u2014 could go to e2? Unless it's pinned or the move isn't listed. But the legal moves list is only 5, so likely only these are possible.\n\nBut the key is: **g5g6** is a legal move \u2014 so the g-pawn can advance.\n\nBut more importantly, the **White king** has several moves: h6 \u2192 h7, g7, g6, h5.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each legal move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze each legal move\n\n#### 1. **h6h7** \u2014 King to h7\n\n- King moves to h7.\n- Now, if Black plays ...f4g5, can the black king attack anything?\n- But White threatens to go h7-h8=Q next move!\n- After h6-h7, next move h7-h8=Q is checkmate? Let\u2019s see.\n\nAfter **h6-h7**, Black must respond.\n\nBlack king on f4. Can it reach h8 in time? No \u2014 it's 4 moves away.\n\nBut can Black promote first?\n\nBlack has a pawn on e3 \u2014 can go e3-e2-e1=Q, that\u2019s two moves.\n\nBut after h6-h7, if Black plays e3-e2, then White plays h7-h8=Q, then Black plays e2-e1=Q, then we have queens.\n\nBut White is promoting with check? h8=Q+ if king is on h7? No \u2014 king is on h7, queen on h8 \u2014 not a check.\n\nBut Black\u2019s queen on e1 doesn\u2019t check.\n\nBut then White can go after the black king.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **h6-h7** safe?\n\nAfter h6-h7, is the king exposed?\n\nNo immediate capture.\n\nBut what about ...f4-g5? g5 is now attacked by black king?\n\nAfter h6-h7, g5 is unoccupied. Black king can go f4-g5?\n\nYes \u2014 f4 to g5 is a legal king move.\n\nSo:\n1. h6-h7? Kg5!\n\nNow Black king attacks h6 and h7? g5 attacks h6 and h7?\n\ng5 \u2192 h6 is diagonal, yes \u2014 so **Kg5 attacks h6 and h7**.\n\nSo after 1. h6-h7? Kg5!, the white king on h7 is attacked by black king on g5.\n\nSo **h6-h7 loses the king**.\n\nTherefore, **h6-h7 is illegal?** But it's in the legal moves list.\n\nWait \u2014 that can't be.\n\nHold on \u2014 if h6-h7 is listed as legal, then it must not be under attack.\n\nBut if Black plays ...Kg5 after h6-h7, then Kg5 attacks h7 \u2014 so the king would be in check.\n\nBut that doesn't make h6-h7 illegal \u2014 it just makes it a blunder.\n\nBut is h6-h7 **legal**? Only if h7 is not attacked.\n\nBut currently, before the move, is h7 attacked?\n\nBlack king is on f4 \u2014 does it attack h7? No \u2014 too far.\n\nAfter h6-h7, the king is on h7. Is it attacked?\n\nOnly if Black can capture it \u2014 i.e., if a black piece attacks h7.\n\nCurrently, only black king and pawns.\n\nBlack king on f4 \u2014 distance to h7 is 3 squares over, 3 up \u2014 not adjacent.\n\nSo h7 is **not attacked**.\n\nBut after h6-h7, if Black plays Kg5, then **Kg5 attacks h6 and h7**.\n\nSo yes \u2014 after 1. h6-h7? Kg5, the white king is captured next move? No \u2014 Black doesn't have to capture, but the king is in **check**.\n\nSo after 1. h6-h7? Kg5+! \u2014 the white king on h7 is in check from g5.\n\nSo White must move the king \u2014 say h7-h6 or h7-g7.\n\nBut then Black can advance e3-e2, etc.\n\nSo **h6-h7? allows Kg5+**, losing the initiative and possibly the win.\n\nSo **h6-h7 is a blunder** \u2014 loses the king immediately to check.\n\nTherefore, **h6-h7 is illegal?** No \u2014 it's legal, but loses to check.\n\nBut if after h6-h7, Black plays Kg5+, then White is in check \u2014 so the move h6-h7 is legal, but bad.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is h7 attacked **before** the move? No. So it's legal.\n\nBut after the move, if it places the king in check, it's illegal.\n\nAh! **That's the key**.\n\nA move that places the king in check is **illegal**.\n\nSo if h6-h7 results in the king being in check **immediately**, then it's not allowed.\n\nSo is h7 attacked **before** the move?\n\nBlack king on f4 \u2014 can it attack h7?\n\nf4 to h7: file difference: h - f = 2, rank difference: 7 - 4 = 3 \u2192 not a king move (max 1 square). So no.\n\nNo other black pieces near.\n\nSo h7 is **not attacked**.\n\nAfter h6-h7, is the king on h7 in check?\n\nOnly if a black piece attacks h7.\n\nBlack king on f4 \u2014 doesn't attack h7.\n\nSo **no** \u2014 the king is not in check after h6-h7.\n\nBut after h6-h7, Black plays Kg5 \u2014 then **Kg5 attacks h7**, so the next move White is in check.\n\nBut that\u2019s after Black\u2019s move \u2014 so it\u2019s allowed.\n\nSo h6-h7 is legal, but **loses immediately to Kg5+**.\n\nSo it\u2019s a blunder.\n\nThus, **h6-h7 is a losing move**.\n\nAvoid.\n\n#### 2. **h6g7** \u2014 King to g7\n\ng7 is adjacent to h6.\n\nIs g7 attacked?\n\nBlack king on f4 \u2014 doesn't attack g7.\n\nNo other pieces.\n\nSo move is legal.\n\nAfter h6-g7, what?\n\nWhite king on g7.\n\nNow, threats: h7, then h8=Q.\n\nBlack king on f4 \u2014 can go to g5?\n\ng5 is empty \u2014 yes.\n\nKf4-g5.\n\nNow, g5 attacks g7? g5 to g7 is two squares up \u2014 no.\n\ng5 attacks f6, h6, f4, h4, f5, h5, g6, g4 \u2014 not g7.\n\nSo no check.\n\nBut now White can play h7? But no pawn on h-file.\n\nWait \u2014 White has no pawn on"
