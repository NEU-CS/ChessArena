When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Wait, the FEN says: `1P1P2gB`? No \u2014 original FEN is:\n\nWait, the FEN is:\n```\n1b2r1k1/5ppp/1R6/1p1p4/1P1P2b1/P3N1P1/4nqBP/2BQ3K w - - 6 34\n```\n\nSo let's parse correctly:\n\n- **8**: `1b2r1k1` \u2192 a8: -, b8: b, c8: -, d8: -, e8: r, f8: -, g8: k, h8: -\n- **7**: `5ppp` \u2192 a7-f7: -, g7: p, h7: p, i7: p \u2192 actually: a7-e7: empty, f7: p, g7: p, h7: p\n- **6**: `1R6` \u2192 a6: -, b6: R, c6-h6: -\n- **5**: `1p1p4` \u2192 a5: -, b5: p, c5: -, d5: p, e5-h5: -\n- **4**: `1P1P2b1` \u2192 a4: -, b4: P, c4: -, d4: P, e4-f4: -, g4: b, h4: -\n- **3**: `P3N1P1` \u2192 a3: P, b3-c3-d3: -, e3: N, f3: -, g3: P, h3: -\n- **2**: `4nqBP` \u2192 a2-d2: -, e2: n, f2: q, g2: B, h2: P\n- **1**: `2BQ3K` \u2192 a1-b1: -, c1: B, d1: Q, e1-h1: -, h1: K\n\nSo final position:\n\n```\n   a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n8: -  b  -  -  r  -  k  -\n7: -  -  -  -  -  p  p  p\n6: -  R  -  -  -  -  -  -\n5: -  p  -  p  -  -  -  -\n4: -  P  -  P  -  -  b  -\n3: P  -  -  -  N  -  P  -\n2: -  -  -  -  n  q  B  P\n1: -  -  B  Q  -  -  -  K\n```\n\nWhite: Kg1, Qd1, Bc1, Bg2, Ne3, Ra6 (b6), pawns: a3, b4, d4, g3, h2  \nBlack: Kg8, Re8, Bb8, Bg4, Ne2, Qf2, pawns: b5, d5, f7, g7, h7\n\nNote: Ra6? Wait \u2014 b6 is R, so **White rook on b6**, not a6.\n\nSo White rook is on **b6**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Material and Threats**\n\n**Material**:\n- White: R, Q, 2B, N, 5P\n- Black: R, Q, 2B, N, 5P\n\u2192 Roughly equal.\n\nBut **tactics** may dominate.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Immediate Threats**\n\nLook at **Black's queen on f2** and **knight on e2** \u2014 both are **attacking h2 and g2**.\n\n- Qf2 attacks h2 (check if king were there), but more importantly:\n- Ne2 is attacking **g3** and **h1** \u2014 but h1 is empty.\n- But **Qf2 is attacking g2** \u2014 which is occupied by White's bishop.\n\nSo **Black queen is attacking White's bishop on g2**.\n\nIs g2 defended?\n\n- g2 is occupied by White bishop.\n- Defenders of g2: h2 pawn? No \u2014 h2 is occupied by pawn, but that doesn't defend g2.\n- Who defends g2? Only **h3** square \u2014 but no piece defends g2 directly.\n\nWait: **King on h1** \u2014 g2 is adjacent to h1, so **King defends g2**.\n\nYes: King on h1 \u2192 defends g2 (diagonally adjacent).\n\nSo **g2 is defended by the king**.\n\nSo Qf2 attacks g2, but it's defended \u2014 so **no immediate capture**.\n\nBut **if White moves the king or bishop**, then g2 might be vulnerable.\n\nAlso: **Ne2 is attacking d4 and f4**, but more importantly, **it's eyeing h1**.\n\nBut h1 is king, so knight can't capture.\n\nNow, **White has a rook on b6**, attacking the 6th rank.\n\nBlack has **rook on e8**, king on g8.\n\nWhite has **queen on d1**, bishop on c1, etc.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Candidate Moves**\n\nWe are given the list of legal moves:\n\n```\nb6b8, b6b7, b6h6, b6g6, b6f6, b6e6, b6d6, b6c6, b6a6, b6b5,\ne3f5, e3d5, e3g4, e3c4, e3c2, e3f1,\ng2d5, g2e4, g2h3, g2f3, g2f1,\nd1a4, d1d3, d1b3, d1e2, d1d2, d1c2, d1g1, d1f1, d1e1,\nc1d2, c1b2,\na3a4, h2h3, h2h4\n```\n\nLet\u2019s look for **tactical opportunities**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 5: Look for Tactics \u2014 Especially Checks, Captures, Threats**\n\n#### **Idea: Rook on b6 \u2014 can it do something?**\n\n- **b6b8**: Rook takes black bishop on b8? Is that possible?\n\nYes! **b6b8** is a **capture** \u2014 rook takes the **black bishop on b8**.\n\nIs b8 defended?\n\n- Black bishop on b8 \u2014 is it defended?\n\nBlack pieces: rook on e8, bishop on g4, knight on e2, queen on f2.\n\nWho defends b8?\n\n- e8 rook? No \u2014 not on same diagonal.\n- Queen on f2? Diagonally \u2014 f2 to b8? f2 is light square, b8 is dark \u2014 no.\n- g4 bishop? g4 is light square, b8 is dark \u2014 no.\n- Knight on e2? e2 to b8? No.\n- King on"
