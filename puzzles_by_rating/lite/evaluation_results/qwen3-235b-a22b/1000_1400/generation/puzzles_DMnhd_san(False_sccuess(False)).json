When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

But g7 pawn is already gone \u2014 Black's pawns are on g6 (captured), f6, e5, b7.\n\nWait: after Kxg6, the g6 pawn is gone. Black plays ...f6-f5.\n\nThen g4xf5, and now the f5 pawn is isolated, but White has king on g6.\n\nBut Black\u2019s king is on d4 \u2014 very far.\n\nIs this a winning path?\n\nBut more critically: after `f5g6`, Black can play ...e5-e4, attacking the e4 pawn?\n\nWait: e4 is a White pawn. After Kxg6, the e4 pawn is undefended? No \u2014 who defends e4?\n\nCurrently, the e4 pawn is defended by the king on f5. But after K goes to g6, e4 is **undefended**.\n\nSo after `f5g6`, Black can play `e5e4!`, attacking the e4 pawn.\n\nThen White must deal with the e4 pawn.\n\nCan White save it? King is on g6, too far. No other pieces. So e4 falls.\n\nSo after:\n\n1. f5g6 e5e4\n\nNow White loses the e4 pawn.\n\nThat\u2019s bad. White is giving up a central pawn for a g6 pawn, which isn\u2019t even a passer.\n\nMoreover, Black now has a protected passer on e4, and the king is on d4 \u2014 close to e4.\n\nBlack\u2019s king can support ...e4-e3 and promote.\n\nSo this looks bad for White.\n\n**Conclusion**: `f5g6` loses the e4 pawn to ...e5-e4, and Black gets a strong passer. Not good.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **f5f6** \u2014 Kf6\n\nKing moves to f6.\n\nNow, White king invades on f6, threatening to support e4-e5 or to go to g7, etc.\n\nAfter `f5f6`, what can Black do?\n\nBlack has pawns on e5 and f6 \u2014 but f6 is now occupied by White king.\n\nSo the f6 pawn is **blocked**.\n\nBlack can play ...e5-e4, again?\n\nBut now, e4 pawn is still defended? No \u2014 king was on f5, now on f6. Is e4 defended?\n\nf6 is adjacent to e4? No: f6 to e4 is two squares down and one left \u2014 not adjacent.\n\nSo e4 is **not** defended after Kf6.\n\nSo again, Black can play `e5e4`, attacking e4.\n\nWhite king on f6 cannot protect e4.\n\nSo again, e4 pawn falls.\n\nSame problem.\n\nAfter `f5f6 e5e4`, White loses e4.\n\nAnd Black has e4 passer, king on d4 \u2014 can support it.\n\nSo again, bad.\n\nWait \u2014 is there any way to prevent ...e5-e4?\n\nUnless White can control e5 or e4.\n\nBut no pieces except king.\n\nSo both `f5g6` and `f5f6` allow ...e5-e4, winning the e4 pawn.\n\nNow, what about `f5e6`?\n\n---\n\n### 3. **f5e6** \u2014 Ke6\n\nKing moves to e6.\n\nNow, king is on e6.\n\nIs e4 defended? e6 is two squares above e4 \u2014 not adjacent. So e4 still **not** defended.\n\nBut wait \u2014 e6 is adjacent to e5.\n\nBlack has a pawn on e5.\n\nSo after `f5e6`, White king attacks the e5 pawn.\n\nSo now, if Black plays `e5e4`, White can play `e6xe5`, capturing the pawn.\n\nSo unlike the other moves, this one **prevents** ...e5-e4 from being free.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAfter `f5e6`:\n\n- King on e6, attacks e5 pawn.\n- Black cannot play ...e5-e4 because it would be captured: ...e5-e4?? exd5 or e6xe5? Wait.\n\nIf Black plays `e5e4`, then White plays `e6e5`, capturing the pawn.\n\nSo Black loses the e5 pawn.\n\nBut is that good for Black? No \u2014 Black would not play ...e5-e4 immediately.\n\nInstead, Black must deal with the threat to e5.\n\nWhat can Black do?\n\n- Move the king: ...d4-e4? But e4 is attacked by White king? No \u2014 king on e6 attacks d5, e5, f5, d6, f6, etc.\n\ne4 is not attacked by e6.\n\nSo ...d4-e4 is possible.\n\nBut after ...d4-e4, White can play e6-d6 or e6-f6, and continue pressuring.\n\nBut more importantly, after `f5e6`, Black is in **zugzwang**-like situation.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\nAfter `f5e6`, Black must respond.\n\nOptions:\n\na) ...e5-e4? \u2014 then Ke6xe5, and White wins the e5 pawn. Then White has king on e5, which is very strong \u2014 can support e4-e5 or go to d6, etc. Black\u2019s king is on d4, far from b-pawns. White has a strong king position.\n\nBut better: after Ke6xe5, White is up a pawn and king invades.\n\nBut Black doesn\u2019t have to play ...e5-e4.\n\nb) ...f6-f5 \u2014 to challenge the center.\n\nAfter ...f5, g4xf5 g6xf5, and now the kingside is open.\n\nBut White king on e6 can go to f6 or d6.\n\nBut e4 pawn is still undefended? Yes \u2014 but now after ...f5, g4xf5, and if ...e5-e4, then Ke6xe5 again.\n\nBut Black might not play ...e5-e4.\n\nc) ...d4-e4 \u2014 king moves to e4.\n\nThen White can play Ke6-d6, targeting the b7 pawn.\n\nBecause now: White has b6 pawn, Black has b7.\n\nWith king on d6, White can support b"
