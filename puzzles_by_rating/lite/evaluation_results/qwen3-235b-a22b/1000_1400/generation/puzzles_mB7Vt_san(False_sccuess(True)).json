When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

But g6 is empty. Wait \u2014 this move is **illegal** unless there's a piece on g6. Let's double-check the board.\n\nWait \u2014 the move list says: `f5g6, f5f4, f5e4`\n\nBut **f5** is occupied by a black pawn? Let's reconstruct the board.\n\n### Step 1: Reconstruct the board from FEN\n\nFEN: `8/3B4/5p2/p2Rrk1p/1p4bP/1P6/P2R1KP1/2r5 b - - 3 37`\n\nLet\u2019s break it down rank by rank (from 8th to 1st):\n\n- **8th rank**: `8` \u2192 8 empty squares\n- **7th rank**: `3B4` \u2192 3 empty, B (white bishop), 4 empty \u2192 so Bd7\n- **6th rank**: `5p2` \u2192 5 empty, black pawn on f6, 2 empty\n- **5th rank**: `p2Rrk1p` \u2192 a5 (black), 2 empty, Rd5 (white), Re5 (black), f5 (black), 1 empty, h5 (black)\n- **4th rank**: `1p4bP` \u2192 1 empty, b4 (black), 4 empty, Bg4 (black), h4 (white)\n- **3rd rank**: `1P6` \u2192 1 empty, b3 (white), 6 empty\n- **2nd rank**: `P2R1KP1` \u2192 a2 (white), 2 empty, Rd2 (white), 1 empty, Kf2 (white), 1 empty, h2 (empty? Wait \u2014 Kf2, so f2 is king, g2 is P? Wait \u2014 \"P2R1KP1\" \u2192 a2=P, then 2 empty (b2,c2), d2=R, e2=empty, f2=K, g2=P, h2=empty? But it says \"KP1\" \u2014 K, P, 1 empty \u2192 so f2=K, g2=P, h2=empty? But then \"P2R1KP1\" = P _ _ R _ K P _\n\nSo:\n- a2: P\n- d2: R\n- f2: K\n- g2: P\n\nSo king is on f2, not g2.\n\n- **1st rank**: `2r5` \u2192 2 empty, Rc1 (black), 5 empty\n\nSo current position:\n\n- **Black pieces**:\n  - King: ? (not shown \u2014 but must be somewhere safe)\n  - Rooks: Re5, Rc1\n  - Bishop: Bg4\n  - Pawns: a5, b4, f6, h5\n  - **Pawn on f5?** Yes \u2014 on e5 is rook, f5 is a black pawn? Wait \u2014 rank 5: `p2Rrk1p` \u2192 a5=p, then b5=?, c5=?, d5=R (white), e5=r (black rook), f5=k? No \u2014 \"rk\" \u2014 that would be rook and king?\n\nWait \u2014 **this is critical**.\n\nThe FEN says: `p2Rrk1p` on the 5th rank.\n\nThat means:\n- a5: p (black pawn)\n- b5: empty\n- c5: empty\n- d5: R (white rook)\n- e5: r (black rook)\n- f5: k (black king?)\n- g5: empty\n- h5: p (black pawn)\n\nWait \u2014 **k** is black king? But then black king is on f5?\n\nBut then the move list includes `f5g6`, `f5f4`, `f5e4` \u2014 all moving from f5.\n\nSo **the black king is on f5**.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo:\n- **Black king on f5**\n- **White bishop on d7**\n- **White rooks on d5 and d2**\n- **Black rook on e5 and c1**\n- **Black bishop on g4**\n- **White king on f2**\n- **White pawns**: a2, b3, g2, h4\n- **Black pawns**: a5, b4, f6, h5\n\nNow, legal moves: `f5g6`, `f5f4`, `f5e4`\n\nSo the black king on f5 can move to:\n- g6\n- f4\n- e4\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move 1: `f5g6` \u2014 Kg6\n\nKing moves from f5 to g6.\n\nIs this safe?\n\n- g6 is currently empty.\n- Is g6 attacked?\n\nCheck for **White\u2019s pieces**:\n\n1. **Bishop on d7** \u2014 light-squared bishop. d7 is a light square. It moves diagonally.\n\nFrom d7, can it attack g6?\n\n- d7 \u2192 e6 \u2192 f5 \u2192 g4 \u2192 h3 \u2014 that\u2019s one diagonal (a4\u2013h1 diagonal)\n- d7 \u2192 c6 \u2192 b5 \u2192 a4 \u2014 other diagonal\n- g6 is on the **g6\u2013d3** diagonal? d3 is light? d7 is light, g6 is dark? Wait:\n\n- d7: d-file, 7th rank \u2192 d is 4th file \u2192 4+7=11 \u2192 odd \u2192 dark square? Wait no:\n\nStandard: a1 is dark. a1: a=1, 1 \u2192 1+1=2 \u2192 even \u2192 dark? Wait \u2014 actually, a1 is dark, and (file + rank) even \u2192 dark, odd \u2192 light?\n\na1: 1+1=2 \u2192 even \u2192 dark \u2192 yes.\n\nSo d7: d=4, 7 \u2192 4+7=11 \u2192 odd \u2192 **light square**\n\ng6: g=7, 6 \u2192 7+6=13 \u2192 odd \u2192 **light square**\n\nSo same color \u2014 bishop on d7 (light-squared) can reach g6?\n\nFrom d7 to g6: difference of +3 files, -1 rank \u2192 slope = -1/3 \u2192 not diagonal.\n\nDiagonals are \u00b11 slope.\n\nSo d7 to g6: \u0394file=+3, \u0394rank=-1 \u2192 not diagonal \u2192 **bishop does not attack g6**\n\n2. **Rooks** \u2014 do they attack g6?\n\n- Rd5: on d5. Can it attack g6? Only if same rank or file.\n\ng6 is g-file, 6th rank. Rd5 is d-file, 5th rank \u2014 no.\n\n- Rd2: d2 \u2014 d-file, 2nd rank \u2014 no.\n\n3. **King on f2** \u2014 too far.\n\n4. **Pawns** \u2014 h4 is on h4, can\u2019t attack g6.\n\nSo **g6 is not attacked**.\n\nBut is the move **legal**? Yes.\n\nBut is it **wise**?\n\nKing moves from f5 to g6 \u2014 advancing into the center-top.\n\nBut now, what about **f6**? Black has a pawn on f6.\n\nAfter Kg6, the f6 pawn is still on f6.\n\nBut now, **White has a bishop on d7** \u2014 can it attack anything?\n\nWait \u2014 after Kg6, is the king exposed?\n\nBut more importantly: **is there a threat to the king on f5 right now?**\n\nCurrently, king on f5.\n\nIs it attacked?\n\n- White bishop on d7: can it attack f5?\n\nd7 to f5: \u0394file=+2, \u0394rank=-2 \u2192 yes, same diagonal (d7\u2013h3 diagonal: d7, e6, f5, g4, h3)\n\nSo **f5 is attacked by Bd7**!\n\nOh! **Critical point**.\n\nThe black king is on f5, which is **on the diagonal of the white bishop on d7**.\n\nSo **the king is in check**?\n\nWait \u2014 is it?\n\nFrom d7 to f5: d7, e6, f5 \u2014 yes, diagonal.\n\nAnd no piece in between.\n\nSo **Bd7 attacks f5**.\n\nBut the king is on f5 \u2014 so **Black is in check**.\n\nBut the FEN says it's Black"
