If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Wait \u2014 let's parse carefully.\n```\n\nLet\u2019s go rank by rank (from 8th to 1st):\n\n- **8**: `8` \u2192 all empty\n- **7**: `4p2p` \u2192 4 empty, e7=pawn (black), 2 empty, h7=pawn (black)\n- **6**: `p3kp2` \u2192 a6=black pawn, 3 empty, e6=black king, 2 empty, h6=pawn? But `p2` means pawn and 2 empty \u2192 so a6=pawn, e6=king, h6=pawn?\nWait: `p3kp2` \u2192 a6=pawn, d6=empty, e6=king, f6=empty, g6=empty, h6=pawn? No \u2014 `p3k` is a6=pawn, then 3 empty (b6,c6,d6), e6=king, then `p2` \u2192 f6=pawn, g6/h6 empty? No: `p2` means one pawn and two empty squares.\n\nWait: `p3kp2` \u2192 that\u2019s:\n- a6: p (black pawn)\n- b6: empty\n- c6: empty\n- d6: empty\n- e6: k (black king)\n- f6: p (black pawn)\n- g6: empty\n- h6: empty\n\nWait \u2014 `p2` means one pawn and two squares \u2192 so after `k`, we have `p` then two empty \u2192 so f6=pawn, g6 and h6 empty.\n\nSo 6th rank: a6=p, b6=\u2013, c6=\u2013, d6=\u2013, e6=k, f6=p, g6=\u2013, h6=\u2013\n\nBut earlier 7th rank: `4p2p` \u2192 a7\u2013d7 empty, e7=p, f7\u2013g7 empty, h7=p\n\nSo h7=p, h6=\u2013 \u2192 okay.\n\nNow 5th rank: `1pp3p1` \u2192 \n- a5: empty\n- b5: p\n- c5: p\n- d5\u2013f5: empty\n- g5: p\n- h5: empty\n\n4th rank: `4P3` \u2192 a4\u2013d4 empty, e4=P (white pawn), f4\u2013h4 empty\n\n3rd rank: `P1P1KP1P` \u2192 \n- a3: P (white pawn)\n- b3: empty\n- c3: P (white pawn)\n- d3: empty\n- e3: K (white king)\n- f3: empty\n- g3: P (white pawn)\n- h3: P (white pawn)\n\n2nd rank: `1P4P1` \u2192 \n- a2: empty\n- b2: P\n- c2\u2013f2: empty\n- g2: P\n- h2: empty\n\n1st rank: `8` \u2192 all empty\n\nSo let\u2019s summarize key positions:\n\n### Material:\n- **White**:\n  - Pawns: a3, b2, c3, e4, g2, h3, g3? Wait \u2014 g3 is on 3rd rank: yes, g3=P\n    So pawns: a3, b2, c3, e4, g2, g3, h3 \u2192 7 pawns\n  - King: e3\n- **Black**:\n  - Pawns: a6, b5, c5, e7, f6, g5, h7 \u2192 7 pawns\n  - King: e6\n\nSo material is roughly equal.\n\n### Positional Assessment:\n\n- **King position**: Both kings on e-file, White king on e3, Black king on e6 \u2014 central, but not immediately in danger.\n- **Pawn structure**:\n  - Central pawns: e4 (White), e7 (Black) \u2014 so e-file has pawns on e4 and e7, with e5 and e6 occupied? e6 has black king.\n  - Black has backward pawns? b5, c5 are on half-open files.\n  - White has pawns on c3, b2, a3 \u2014 somewhat solid.\n  - Black has a6, which may be weak.\n  - On kingside: White has g2, g3, h3; Black has g5, h7.\n  - e4-e5 tension: e4 is advanced, e5 is empty. Pushing e4-e5 could be key.\n\n### Critical area: Center and kingside.\n\nWhite to move.\n\n### Legal moves provided:\n```\ne3d3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2, e4e5, h3h4, f3f4, c3c4, a3a4, g2g3, b2b3, g2g4, b2b4\n```\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each **candidate move**.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **e4e5** \u2014 Push the central pawn.\n\nThis is a very strong candidate.\n\nAfter **e4-e5**, the position opens up.\n\nBlack king is on e6 \u2014 if e4-e5, then e5 is attacked, and the king may be driven back.\n\nAfter **1. e5+**, Black must move the king:\n- Ke6-f5? But f5 may be attacked later.\n- Or Ke6-d5? But then White can play c3-c4+ or something.\n\nBut let\u2019s see:\n\nAfter **e4-e5+**, Ke6-f5\n\nNow White can play **g3-g4+**, forcing the king to e6 or f6, but g4+ might not be immediate.\n\nWait \u2014 after e5+, Kf5, then **g4+** is possible? g3-g4+ would attack f5.\n\nYes: g4+ forces Kxg4 or Kf6.\n\nBut Kxg4? Then h3xg4, and Black king is exposed.\n\nBut let\u2019s not get ahead.\n\nIs e5+ winning space and initiative? Yes.\n\nAlso, it restricts Black\u2019s king and opens lines.\n\nMoreover, Black has pawns on f6 and e7 \u2014 after e5, the e7 pawn is backward and may become weak.\n\nAlso, White can follow up with f4 or g4 to gain space on kingside.\n\nSo **e4e5** looks very promising.\n\nBut let\u2019s check if it\u2019s safe.\n\nAfter e4-e5, Black plays ...Ke6-f5\n\nNow can White play f3-f4? But f4 would be met by ...g5xf4, exf4, and then king can go to f6 or e6.\n\nBut White can instead play **g2-g4+** immediately?\n\nAfter e5+, Kf5, then **g4+**!\n\ng4+ forces:\n- Kxg4 \u2192 h3xg4, and now Black king is on g4, exposed, and White can bring king or other pieces.\n- Or Kf6, then g5+ forces king back to e6 or f5, but g5+ may not be possible yet.\n\nWait: after e5+, Kf5, g4+:\n\n- If Kxg4, then hxg4, and now Black king is on g4, White has king on e3, can play Kf2, etc. But is that dangerous?\n\nBlack has pawns on h7 and g5 \u2014 after g4, gxg4, hxg4, so h-file is open.\n\nBut Black king on g4 is very exposed. White can bring king to f2, maybe even f3, and attack.\n\nBut Black may have ...f6-f5 to block.\n\nBut after e5, f5 is not possible because e5 blocks.\n\nAfter e5, f6 is still possible? f6 is occupied by black pawn.\n\nBlack pawn on f6 \u2014 so after e5, f6 is blocked.\n\nSo after e5+, Kf5, g4+:\n\n- Kxg4, hxg4 \u2014 now Black king on g4, White has pawns on g3 (now g4), h3 (captured), so h-file open.\n\nBut Black has h7 pawn, so not immediate danger.\n\nBut White can play Kf2, and prepare Kf3, attacking the g4 pawn? No, g4 is White.\n\nWhite has pawn on g4 now.\n\nBlack king on g4 \u2014 can be attacked by f3-f4, opening the f-file?\n\nBut f3 is empty \u2014 White has no piece on f3.\n\nOnly king and"
