If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Positional Overview**\n\nFEN breakdown:\n\n- **Black to move**\n- **Material:**\n  - Black: King on e8? Wait \u2014 no, Black king is not on e8. Let's reconstruct the board.\n\nLet\u2019s lay out the board from the FEN:\n\n```\n8:  5r2   \u2192 _ _ _ _ \u265c _ _ _\n7:  1pp1p3 \u2192 _ \u265f \u265f _ \u265f _ _ _\n6:  3p2p1 \u2192 _ _ _ \u265f _ _ \u265f _\n5:  p1nPk3 \u2192 \u265f _ \u265e \u2659 \u26cf _ _ _\n4:  2PR4 \u2192 _ _ \u2656 \u26cf _ _ _ _\n3:  BP2pBP1 \u2192 \u2657 \u265f _ _ \u265f \u2657 \u265f _\n2:  P3P1KP \u2192 \u2659 _ _ _ \u2659 _ \u265a \u2659\n1:  8 \u2192 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 there's a problem. The Black king is not visible. Let's double-check.\n\nLooking at the 2nd rank: `P3P1KP` \u2192 \u2659 _ _ _ \u2659 _ \u265a \u2659 \u2192 so White king is on g2.\n\nBlack king must be on e8? But e8 is empty in 8th rank: `5r2` \u2192 five empty, then rook, two empty \u2192 so rook on f8, king not visible.\n\nWait \u2014 where is the Black king?\n\nLet\u2019s re-express the board carefully:\n\n```\nRank 8: 5r2 \u2192 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u265c \u25a1 \u25a1  (a8\u2013h8)\nRank 7: 1pp1p3 \u2192 \u25a1 \u265f \u265f \u25a1 \u265f \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1\nRank 6: 3p2p1 \u2192 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u265f \u25a1 \u25a1 \u265f \u25a1\nRank 5: p1nPk3 \u2192 \u265f \u25a1 \u265e \u2659 \u26cf \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1\nRank 4: 2PR4 \u2192 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u2656 \u26cf \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1\nRank 3: BP2pBP1 \u2192 \u2657 \u265f \u25a1 \u25a1 \u265f \u2657 \u265f \u25a1\nRank 2: P3P1KP \u2192 \u2659 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u2659 \u25a1 \u265a \u2659\nRank 1: 8 \u2192 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1 \u25a1\n```\n\nSo where is the Black king?\n\nIt's not on e8 \u2014 that square is empty. But on e5 we have a White pawn (from \"e5\" in \"p1nPk3\" \u2014 so d5=\u2659, e5=\u26cf).\n\nWait \u2014 \"p1nPk3\" on rank 5: a5=\u265f, b5=\u25a1, c5=\u265e, d5=\u2659, e5=\u26cf, then f5\u2013h5=\u25a1.\n\nSo e5 is a **White pawn**.\n\nBut the king symbol is \u26cf \u2014 that's the White king? No \u2014 in standard FEN, \"k\" is Black king, \"K\" is White king.\n\nAh! Here's the mistake.\n\nFEN uses:\n- Uppercase = White\n- Lowercase = Black\n\nSo:\n- \"k\" = Black king\n- \"K\" = White king\n\nSo in \"p1nPk3\":\n- p = Black pawn on a5\n- 1 = one empty\n- n = Black knight on c5\n- P = White pawn on d5\n- k = Black king on e5?!\n- 3 = three empty\n\nWait \u2014 **Black king on e5**?\n\nThat can't be \u2014 e5 is occupied by a Black king, but d5 has a White pawn, and e4 has a White rook (from d4: R on d4), and e3 has a Black pawn.\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct:\n\n- e5: Black king (k)\n- d5: White pawn (P)\n- e4: White rook (R on d4? d4=R, e4 is empty? Wait)\n\nRank 4: \"2PR4\" \u2192 two empty, then P? No \u2014 \"P\" is White pawn, but we already have a White pawn on d5.\n\nWait \u2014 \"2PR4\": two empty, then P? But P is White pawn \u2014 but d4 is occupied?\n\nNo \u2014 \"2PR4\" means:\n- a4: \u25a1\n- b4: \u25a1\n- c4: P (White pawn)? But we already have a White pawn on d5.\n\nWait \u2014 no: \"P\" is uppercase, so White piece.\n\nBut in rank 5: d5 = P (White pawn)\n\nSo two White pawns on d5 and c4? Possible.\n\nBut \"2PR4\" \u2192 two empty, then P, R, then four empty.\n\nSo:\n- a4: \u25a1\n- b4: \u25a1\n- c4: P (White pawn)\n- d4: R (White rook)\n- e4\u2013h4: \u25a1\n\nYes.\n\nSo e4 is empty.\n\nNow, e5: Black king (k)\n\ne4: empty\n\ne3: Black pawn (from e3 in rank 3: \"p\" in \"BP2pBP1\" \u2014 so e3=\u265f)\n\ne2: White pawn (P in \"P3P1KP\" \u2014 e2=P)\n\ng2: White king (K)\n\nSo Black king is on **e5** \u2014 in the center, surrounded.\n\nThis is critical.\n\n---\n\n### **Current Position Summary**\n\n- **Black king on e5** \u2014 exposed in the center\n- **White king on g2** \u2014 relatively safe\n- **Black to move**\n\nMaterial:\n- Black: King (e5), Rook (f8), Knight (c5), pawns on a5, b7, c7, e7, d6, g6, e3, b3?
