Wait \u2014 pawns on c3, b2, a2, f3, g2, h4 \u2014 and possibly b3/a3? No \u2014 FEN: `2KR4` on back rank, then `PP4P1` on 2nd rank \u2014 so pawns on a2, b2, g2. Then `2P2P2` on 3rd \u2014 so c3, f3.

Wait no:\n\nWait, FEN is: `6k1/3B1p2/pr4p1/2c4p/5p1P/2P2P2/PP4P1/2KR4`\n\nWait, user input: `6k1/3B1p2/pr4p1/2b4p/5p1P/2P2P2/PP4P1/2KR4 w - - 1 28`\n\nSo:\n\n- Rank 5: `2b4p` \u2192 a5: empty, b5: empty, c5: b (Black bishop), d5-e5-f5-g5: empty, h5: p (black pawn)\n- Rank 4: `5p1P` \u2192 a4-e4: empty, f4: p (black pawn), g4: empty, h4: P (white pawn)\n- Rank 3: `2P2P2` \u2192 a3: empty, b3: empty, c3: P, d3: empty, e3: empty, f3: P, g3: empty, h3: empty\n- Rank 2: `PP4P1` \u2192 a2: P, b2: P, c2-d2-e2-f2: empty, g2: P, h2: empty\n- Rank 1: `2KR4` \u2192 a1: empty, b1: empty, c1: K, d1: R, e1-h1: empty\n\nSo corrected:\n\n### **Pieces:**\n\n**White:**\n- King: c1\n- Rook: d1\n- Bishop: d7\n- Pawns: a2, b2, c3, f3, g2, h4\n\n**Black:**\n- King: g8\n- Rook: b6 (on b6)\n- Bishop: c5\n- Pawns: a6 (p), f7, g6, h5, f4, h5?

But it's on d7, attacking along the a4-e8 diagonal.\n\nWait \u2014 is the bishop on d7 under threat? Black has no immediate capture on d7.\n\nBut let's see: Black bishop on c5 \u2014 controls a3, b4, d6, e7, f8.\n\nWhite rook on d1 \u2014 controls d-file.\n\nBlack rook on b6 \u2014 controls b-file, and is attacking the b2 pawn? b6-b2? No \u2014 b-file: b6 to b2 has b2 pawn, but no direct attack because b3 is empty? b3 is empty \u2014 so rook on b6 can go to b3, b2, etc.\n\nBut b2 is defended by a2 and c3.\n\nBut **White's bishop on d7 is currently undefended**.\n\nCan Black capture it? ...c5-b6? No \u2014 b6 is occupied by black rook.\n\n...c5-b4? Yes \u2014 but not attacking d7.\n\n...c5-e7? No \u2014 e7 is empty.\n\nWait \u2014 can Black play ...c5xd7? Yes \u2014 if the bishop is not defended.\n\nIs d7 defended? White has no piece defending d7. King on c1, rook on d1 \u2014 but d1 is on same file.\n\nIf Black plays ...c5xd7, then Bxd7, and White loses bishop.\n\nSo **bishop on d7 is hanging**!\n\nWait \u2014 is that right?\n\nBlack to move could play ...c5xd7, and since no white piece recaptures (rook on d1 \u2014 but d7 is not on d-file? d7 is on d-file! d1-d7 is same file.\n\nSo if ...c5xd7, then Rxd7 \u2014 rook recaptures.\n\nSo the bishop is **defended by the rook on d1**.\n\nSo it's safe.\n\nBut if White moves the bishop, then the rook might not be able to recapture \u2014 but for now, it's defended.\n\nBut if White moves the bishop, then the rook still controls d7.\n\nBut let's see: if White plays Bc8, then ...c5-b6? Not a problem.\n\nBut more importantly \u2014 what is the **goal**?\n\nWhite has a bishop that can become very strong \u2014 it's a light-squared bishop, and many pawns are on dark squares.\n\nBut let's look for **tactics**.\n\n### **Candidate Moves:**\n\nLet\u2019s go through the legal moves:\n\n- **Be8**: Bishop to e8 \u2014 attacking g6, maybe f7? But retreats.\n- **Bc8**: retreats to c8\n- **Be6**: bishop to e6 \u2014 attacking f7, g6?\n- **Bc6**: to c6 \u2014 attacks b6 rook? c6-b6?"
