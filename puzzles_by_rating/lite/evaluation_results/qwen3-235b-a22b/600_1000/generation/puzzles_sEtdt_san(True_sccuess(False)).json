If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

The bishop on c4 targets f7 and potentially h7/g8 if opened.\n\nBlack has **two rooks on the 2nd rank**, one of which (Rf2) is **pinned** against the king because of the rook on f1. However, **Rf2 is attacking the f1 rook**, and if White is not careful, Black could play ...Rxf1+ followed by ...Rf8, doubling rooks on the f-file.\n\nBut crucially, **White has a strong tactical possibility**.\n\n---\n\n### **Candidate Moves**\n\nLet\u2019s analyze key candidates:\n\n#### **1. Qxg7+!** \u2014 Immediate check\n\n- **Qxg7+** forces **Kxg7**, then **Rf7+**, skewering the king and queen!\n- Let's calculate:\n\n  1. **Qxg7+! Kxg7**\n  2. **Rf7+! Kg8** (only move; Kh8?? allows Rg7#)\n  3. **Rxf2** \u2014 now White wins a rook and is up a full piece.\n\n  After 3...Qxf2, White plays **Rxa7**, winning a pawn and having a completely winning endgame: R+B vs R.\n\n  Alternatively, if Black tries 2...Kh8?? instead of Kg8, then **Rg7#** \u2014 mate!\n\nSo **Qxg7+** leads to either:\n- A forced win of material (rook + pawn), or\n- Immediate checkmate if Black blunders.\n\nThis is a **decisive tactical blow**.\n\n---\n\n#### Are there any better moves?\n\nLet\u2019s check if **Qd8+** or **Qb8** lead to mate.\n\n- **Qd8+?** Kg8, Qe8+? Kh7, but Black escapes and may even counter with ...Rf8. Not decisive.\n- **Qc8** \u2014 threatens mate on h8, but Black plays **Qf3!**, attacking f1 and threatening mate on h1. Suddenly White is in danger.\n\nSimilarly, **Qf7**? Qxf7, Rxf7, Rf8 \u2014 Black regains the piece and has strong counterplay.\n\nBut **Qxg7+** is forcing and wins material cleanly.\n\n---\n\n### **Why is Qxg7+ the best?**\n\n- It\u2019s a **check**, so Black has no time to coordinate counterplay.\n- After **Kxg7, Rf7+** is **discovered attack** with the rook, hitting the queen.\n- Black **cannot save the queen** \u2014 the king must move, and then **Rxf2** wins a rook.\n- White emerges **up a full rook and a pawn**, with active pieces.\n\nNo other move gives such a clear, forced advantage.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Qxg7+** is the strongest move \u2014 a decisive tactical shot that wins material and maintains complete control.\n\n```\nQxg7+\n```"
