If the bishop moves or is removed, g6 is vulnerable.\n4. **White has several checks available**: `Nh5+`, `Nf5+`, `Qxg6+`\n5. **The knight on g3 can jump to h5 or f5 with check**, potentially forking or forcing the king.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most forcing moves first.\n\n---\n\n### **Candidate Moves**\n\n#### 1. **Nh5+?**\n- `Nh5+`: Knight to h5 with check.\n- Black responds: `gxh5` (forced, since king can't move and capturing with king would be illegal).\n- Then `Qxg6+!` is possible: **Qxg6+ Kh8, Qxh5+` with a strong attack.\n- But wait: after `Nh5+ gxh5`, then `Qxg6+ Kh8`, and now `Qxh5+`? But the queen is already on g6 \u2014 no, `Qxg6+` is a different move.\n\nWait \u2014 let's clarify:\n\nAfter `1. Nh5+ gxh5`, then `2. Qxg6+` is possible.\n\n- `2... Kf8?` \u2014 loses to `3. Qg7#`\n- `2... Kh8` \u2014 then `3. Qxh5+`? But queen is on g6 \u2014 `Qxh5+` is not possible unless the queen moves.\n\nWait \u2014 `Qxg6+` is **already** a move in the legal list.\n\nSo perhaps **Qxg6+** is better than Nh5+?\n\nLet\u2019s analyze **Qxg6+** directly.\n\n#### 2. **Qxg6+!!**\n- `Qxg6+` \u2014 sacrifice the queen.\n- Black must respond:\n  - `Kxg6` \u2014 only legal move (f6 is blocked, h7 is not accessible).\n- Then: `Nh5+!` \u2014 check.\n  - Now Black must play `Kh7` (only move).\n- Then: `Bxg6+!` \u2014 bishop takes on g6 with check.\n  - `Kxh5`? No \u2014 king can't capture bishop because it's protected by knight? Wait:\n\nWait \u2014 after:\n1. Qxg6+! Kxg6\n2. Nh5+ Kh7\n3. Bxg6+? \u2014 but Bc3 is on c3, not near g6.\n\n**Bc3 cannot go to g6** \u2014 that\u2019s impossible.\n\nSo `Bxg6` is not possible.\n\nSo that line fails.\n\nWait \u2014 is there another follow-up?\n\nAfter:\n1. Qxg6+ Kxg6\n2. Nh5+ Kh7\nNow what?\n\nWhite has **Rxe8**, winning the rook.\n\nBut after `Rxe8`, Black plays `Qe6`, attacking the knight on h5 and threatening ...Qe1#.\n\nAlso, the knight on h3 is still there, threatening ...Nxg1 or ...Nf2.\n\nSo after:\n1. Qxg6+ Kxg6\n2. Nh5+ Kh7\n3. Rxe8 Qe6\n\nNow Black is threatening mate on e1, and also the knight on h5 is hanging unless White plays f3 or something.\n\nBut White can play `Re3`, blocking, but it's messy.\n\nMoreover, Black has `...Nf2` coming, winning material.\n\nSo **Qxg6+** leads to complications, but likely loses after accurate defense.\n\nSo perhaps not sound.\n\nLet\u2019s reconsider **Nh5+**\n\n#### 3. **Nh5+!**\n- `Nh5+` \u2014 knight checks.\n- Black must play `gxh5` (only move \u2014 king can't take, no other piece can).\n- Now: **Qxg6+!!** \u2014 queen sacrifices.\n  - `Kxg6` \u2014 forced.\n- Now: **Rxe8** \u2014 winning the rook.\n  - Black plays `Qe6` \u2014 again, threatening ...Qe1#.\n- But now White has **Re3!**, blocking the check.\n  - Then Black has `Nf2`, attacking the rook on e3 and threatening mate.\n  - But White plays `Kf1`, escaping.\n\nLet\u2019s write the line:\n\n1. Nh5+! gxh5  \n2. Qxg6+! Kxg6  \n3. Rxe8 Qe6  \n4. Re3 Nf2+  \n5. Kf1\n\nNow Black has no good continuation. The knight on f2 is attacked, and if `...Nd3`, White can play `Rd3`.\n\nMaterial: White is up a rook for a queen and knight \u2014 but wait:\n\nWhite gave up queen and knight, got a rook and pawn? No:\n\n- White sacrificed Q + N = 10 points\n- Gained: g6 pawn and h5 pawn? And rook on e8?\n\nNo \u2014 Black still has the rook \u2014 White captured it.\n\nSo White: lost Q + N, gained R + 2 pawns? That\u2019s about equal.\n\nBut positionally, Black\u2019s king is exposed, and White has active pieces.\n\nBut more importantly \u2014 after 5. Kf1, Black has no mate, and White is better.\n\nBut is there a better move?\n\nWait \u2014 after 2... Kxg6, 3. Rxe8, Black plays 3... Qe6, but what if White plays **Re7** instead of Re3?\n\n3. Rxe8 Qe6  \n4. Re7! \u2014 attacking the queen and threatening mate on g7.\n\nBecause Re7 attacks g7, and the king is on g6.\n\nSo:\n\n4... Qd6 (only to block)  \n5. Rg7+! Kf6  \n6. Rf7+ Ke6  \n7. Re7+ Kd6  \n8. Rxe6+ fxe6 \u2014 and White is up a piece.\n\nBut Black has pawns and activity.\n\nStill, it's messy.\n\nBut perhaps there's a **better** check.\n\n#### 4. **Nf5+!**\n\n`Nf5+` \u2014 knight to f5 with check.\n\n- Black must play `Kf7` (g8 is blocked by rook, h7 is not accessible).\n- Now the king is in the center.\n- White can play `Qxg6+!` \u2014 again, queen sacrifice.\n  - `Ke7` \u2014 forced (Kf8 allows Qg7#)\n  - Then `Ne7!` \u2014 knight captures queen? No, knight is on f5.\n\nWait \u2014 `Ne7` is not possible.\n\nAfter:\n1. Nf5+ Kf7  \n2. Qxg6+ Ke7  \n3. Ne7? \u2014 no, knight is on f5, can't go to e7.\n\nBut `Rxe8` is possible: 3. Rxe8 Qxe8  \nNow Black has queen on e8, king on e7, and knight on h3.\n\nWhite has queen on g6.\n\nBut `Qg7+` is possible: Qg7+ Ke6, then Qg6+ again, but it's a draw?\n\nNot really winning.\n\nAlternatively, after `Nf5+ Kf7`, play `Rxe8` first?\n\n1. Nf5+ Kf7  \n2. Rxe8 Qxe8  \n3. Qxg6+ Ke7  \n4. Ne7! \u2014 now yes, knight can go to e7, attacking the queen.\n\nBecause knight on f5 can go to e7.\n\nSo:\n\n4... Qf8 (only move to save queen)  \n5. Nc6+! \u2014 fork on queen and king?  \n- Kd7  \n- Qe8  \n- But Nc6+ attacks queen on f8? No.\n\nNc6+ from e7? e7 to"
