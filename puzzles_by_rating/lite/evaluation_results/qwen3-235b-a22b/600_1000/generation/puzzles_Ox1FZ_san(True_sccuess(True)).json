White has a knight on f6, which is attacking g8 and h7, and also putting pressure on the black king. The queen on c5 is also threatening the black king.\n\nAfter either capture, Black would likely play Qxg2+ or Qh1+.\n\nBut crucially, if I play fxg3, I maintain the h-pawn which could be important for king safety. If I play hxg3, I lose the h-pawn.\n\nAlso, after fxg3, the f-file is opened for the rook on f1, which could be useful.\n\nHowever, the most important consideration is that after either capture, I need to deal with the queen check.\n\nBut let's look deeper: after fxg3, Black plays Qxg2+, then Kxg2 and the queen is captured. But wait - is that checkmate? No, because after Qxg2+, Kxg2 would capture the queen.\n\nActually, after fxg3, Black's queen on h3 gives check with Qxg2+.\n\nWhite can respond with Kxg2, capturing the queen.\n\nSimilarly, after hxg3, Qxg2+ Kxg2.\n\nIn both cases, White ends up capturing Black's queen.\n\nBut which capture is better?\n\nAfter fxg3, the f-pawn is gone, but the h-pawn remains. The f-file is opened for the rook.\n\nAfter hxg3, the h-pawn is gone, which might weaken the kingside more.\n\nMoreover, with fxg3, the f-file is opened and the rook on f1 can become active.\n\nBut more importantly, I need to see if there's a tactical follow-up.\n\nWhite has a knight on f6, which is attacking g8 and h7. After the exchange of rook and queen, White might have attacking chances.\n\nBut both captures lead to roughly similar positions.\n\nHowever, fxg3 maintains the h-pawn, which is important for king safety, especially since the king is on g1.\n\nhxg3 removes the h-pawn, creating potential weaknesses on the kingside.\n\nTherefore, fxg3 is better as it preserves the h-pawn structure.\n\nAlso, after fxg3, the f-file is opened, which could be useful for the rook.\n\n```\nfxg3\n```"
