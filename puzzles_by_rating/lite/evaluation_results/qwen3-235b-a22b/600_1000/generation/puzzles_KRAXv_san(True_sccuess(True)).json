When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

White is to move, and the only legal move available is `Rxf1`.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position:\n\n- White\u2019s king is on h1, and Black has heavy pieces aimed at the kingside: a rook on f8, queen on f1 (attacking the rook on f1), and a rook on h8. The black queen on f1 is delivering a *discovered attack* threat because it\u2019s on the same file as the white king, and the white rook on f1 is blocking the check.\n- If White doesn\u2019t capture the queen, Black would play `Qxh1#` next, as the queen on f1 is attacking h1 and the rook on f1 is the only piece shielding the king.\n- Therefore, White **must** capture the queen on f1 with the rook: `Rxf1`.\n\nThis move is forced \u2014 any other move would be illegal, as the king would remain in check or the queen would capture the king.\n\nAfter `Rxf1`, Black will likely play `Rxf1+`, leading to `Kg2`, and the game continues, but White has no choice.\n\nThus, the only legal and correct move is:\n\n```\nRxf1\n```"
