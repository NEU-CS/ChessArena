        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully.\n\n**FEN:** `6r1/p1R5/1k4rp/1p2p3/1P2P3/P7/2R3P1/6K1 b - - 0 36`\n\nWe are told it's **Black to move** (since the FEN has `b` in the turn field).\n\n### Material\n- Black: Rook on g8, Rook on g6, pawn a7, b5, e5, h6\n- White: Rook on c7, Rook on c2, pawns a3, b4, e4, g2\n- Both sides have two rooks and several pawns.\n\n### Positional Assessment\nBlack has a rook on g6 (attacking the g2-pawn) and another on g8. White has two rooks doubled on the c-file, currently pinning the black king on the 6th rank.\n\nThe black king is on b6, quite exposed but not immediately under threat.\n\nKey tactical feature:\n- **Rxg2+** is a legal move \u2014 this checks the white king.\n- After **Rxg2+**, White must recapture: **Kxg2**, since the king is on g1.\n- Then Black has **Rg8**, reactivating the other rook, potentially doubling on the g-file or threatening mate on g2 if White isn't careful.\n\nBut let's evaluate **Rxg2+** more deeply:\n\n1. **... Rxg2+**\n2. **Kxg2 Rg8+**\n3. **Kf3?? Rxc7!** \u2014 winning a rook, but White won't allow that.\n\nAfter **... Rg8+**, White can play **Kf1** or **Kh1** or **Kf3**, depending.\n\nBut actually:\n- 1... Rxg2+  \n- 2. Kxg2 Rg8+  \n- 3. Kf3? Rxc7! wins material \u2014 but is that good?\n\nWait: after 3... Rxc7, White plays **Rxc7**, and now Black is just losing a rook for a rook \u2014 but Black started with a rook sacrifice.\n\nNo: **Rxc7** is White's rook on c7 being captured. So:\n- 3... Rxc7\n- 4. Rxc7\n\nNow material is equal, but Black has no immediate follow-up. And White has a strong position, possibly pushing b5 or central pawns.\n\nBut Black gave up a rook for a pawn and ended up trading rooks \u2014 not good.\n\nSo **Rxg2+** leads to:\n- 1... Rxg2+ 2. Kxg2 Rg8+ 3. Kf3 Rxc7 4. Rxc7\n\nNow Black has only one rook left, White has one rook, and Black has no compensation. **This loses a pawn for nothing.**\n\nSo **Rxg2+** is likely a blunder.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a better follow-up?\n\nAfter **... Rg8+**, if White plays **Kh1**, then Black can play **Rg6**, re-coordinating, and the position is roughly equal. But again, Black just gave up a pawn for no gain.\n\nSo **Rxg2+** is not compelling.\n\n### Alternative: Activate the other rook\n\nBlack's rook on g8 is passive. We should consider **Rg8**, but it's already on g8. So **Rg7** is possible: **R8g7** or **R6g7**.\n\nActually, **R8g7** means rook from g8 to g7; **R6g7** means rook from g6 to g7 \u2014 but that would be retreating the active rook.\n\nSo **R8g7** is better: centralizing the inactive rook.\n\nBut is that useful?\n\nAlternatively, **Rf8**, **Re8**, etc., to double on the 8th rank?\n\nBut White doesn't have a rook on the 8th.\n\nWait \u2014 White has rooks on c7 and c2. The c-file is their strength.\n\nBlack king is on b6 \u2014 close to the c7 rook.\n\nCan we attack the c7 rook?\n\n**... Rxc7** is possible: **Rxc7**\n\nIs that playable?\n\n1... Rxc7  \n2. Rxc7\n\nNow rook takes rook. Black can play **Ka6**, escaping the pin and threatening ...b4? Or ...a5?\n\nBut after **Rxc7 Rxc7**, we have:\n\n- Rooks trade on c-file\n- Black has king on b6, White king on g1\n- Black has rook on g6, White has rook on c2\n\nNow Black can play **Rg4**, for example, to threaten g2 again.\n\nBut White can play **a4**, opening the file?\n\nAlternatively, **... Rc6** after **Rxc7** would be possible, pinning the rook.\n\nWait \u2014 after **1... Rxc7 2. Rxc7**, Black plays **Rc6!**, attacking the rook on c7.\n\nYes! That's the key.\n\nSo:\n- 1... Rxc7!\n- 2. Rxc7 Rc6!\n\nNow the rook on c7 is attacked, and it's **pinned** to the king along the c-file? No \u2014 the king is on g1, not on c1.\n\nc-file: White rook on c7, Black rook on c6, White rook on c2.\n\nAfter **Rxc7 Rxc7 Rc6**, the rook on c2 is now under attack by the rook on c6.\n\nAnd **Rc2 is pinned** \u2014 because if it moves, the king is exposed to ...Rc1+.\n\nYes! The king is on g1, so the c-file is open \u2014 **Rc2 is pinned to the king**.\n\nSo **... Rc6** wins the rook on c2.\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n1. ... Rxc7!  \n2. Rxc7 Rc6!  \n3. Now White cannot save the rook on c2 because:\n   - If **Rb2**, then **Rxb2** wins it.\n   - If **Rd2**, **Rc1+** skewers \u2014 king must move, then **Rxd2**.\n   - If **Rc3**, **Rc1+** again, then **Rc2** or **Rc1**, winning the rook.\n   - Only **Rc4** or **Rc5** might delay, but **Rc1+** still comes, and after **Kg2**, **Rc2** wins the rook anyway.\n\nSo yes \u2014 **... Rc6** wins at least a rook.\n\nTherefore, **1... Rxc7!** is a winning move.\n\nBut is **Rxc7** in the list of legal moves?\n\nLook at the legal moves provided:\n\n> Legal moves in SAN notation: Rh8, Rf8, Re8, Rd8, Rc8, Rb8, Ra8, R8g7, R6g7, Rf6, Re6, Rd6, Rc6, Rg5, Rg4, Rg3, Rxg2+, Ka6, a6, h5, a5\n\n**Rc8** is listed \u2014 that means **Rook from g8 or g6 to c8**?\n\nIn SAN, **Rc8** means a rook moving to c8. Since both rooks can potentially go to c8, but only the rook on g8 can reach c8 via the 8th rank.\n\nBut **Rxc7** is **not** listed.\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s a problem.\n\nThe legal moves do **not** include **Rxc7**.\n\nBut why?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the position:\n\n- Black rook on g8: can it go to c8? Yes, along the 8th rank \u2014 so **Rc8** is possible.\n- Can it capture on c7? c7 has a white rook.\n\nSo **Rxc7** should be legal.\n\nBut it's not in the list.\n\nSimilarly, **Rd8**, **Re8**, etc., are listed, but not **Rxc7**.\n\nWait \u2014 is the rook on g8 **pinned**?\n\nNo \u2014 the white rook on c7 is on c7, and the black king is on b6.\n\nIs the c-file between c7 and b6 occupied? c6 is empty.\n\nSo if the rook on g8 moves to c8, and then we play ...Rc6, is the king exposed?\n\nNo \u2014 the king is on b6, not on the c-file.\n\nBut if the rook on g8 moves to c7, capturing, then the king is still on b6 \u2014 no check.\n\nSo **Rxc7** should be legal.\n\nBut it\u2019s not in the list.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the **rook on g6** is the one that could capture on c6? But c6 is empty.\n\nNo \u2014 **Rxc7** must be from the rook on g8.\n\nBut why isn't it listed?\n\nUnless... is the square c7 defended in a way that prevents capture?\n\nWhite has:\n- Rook on c7\n- Rook on c2\n- King on g1\n\nIf Black plays **Rg8xc7**, then White can play **Rc"
