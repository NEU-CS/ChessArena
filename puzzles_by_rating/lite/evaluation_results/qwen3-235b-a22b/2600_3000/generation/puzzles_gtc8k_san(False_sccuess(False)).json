When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Board Visualization**\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the board:\n\n```\n8:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  k     (a8-h8)\n7:  -  -  -  -  -  -  b  -     (a7-h7)\n6:  -  -  p  -  B  -  P  p     (a6-h6)\n5:  -  -  P  p  -  -  -  -     (a5-h5)\n4:  -  P  q  p  -  R  -  -     (a4-h4)\n3:  -  -  n  -  -  -  -  -     (a3-h3)\n2:  -  B  Q  -  -  -  P  -     (a2-h2)\n1:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  K     (a1-h1)\n\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWhite: Kg1, Qc2, Rf4, Be6, Bb2, pawns on b4, c5, g2, g6  \nBlack: Kh8, Bg7, Nc3, Qd4, Ra2, pawns on c6, d5, h6, c4, d4 (c4 and d4 are both occupied? Wait \u2014 c4 has a black queen, d4 has a black pawn? Let's double-check.)\n\nWait \u2014 the FEN is: `7k/6b1/2p1B1Pp/2Pp4/1Pqp1R2/2n5/rBQ3P1/6K1`\n\nLet\u2019s parse it carefully:\n\n- **Rank 8**: `7k` \u2192 7 empty, then k on h8\n- **Rank 7**: `6b1` \u2192 6 empty, b on g7, 1 empty \u2192 so g7: B\n- **Rank 6**: `2p1B1Pp` \u2192 a6: -, b6: -, c6: p, d6: -, e6: B, f6: -, g6: P, h6: p\n- **Rank 5**: `2Pp4` \u2192 a5: -, b5: -, c5: P, d5: p, then 4 empty \u2192 e5-h5 empty\n- **Rank 4**: `1Pqp1R2` \u2192 a4: -, b4: P, c4: q, d4: p, e4: -, f4: R, g4: -, h4: -\n- **Rank 3**: `2n5` \u2192 a3: -, b3: -, c3: n, then 5 empty\n- **Rank 2**: `rBQ3P1` \u2192 a2: r, b2: B, c2: Q, d2-e2-f2: -, g2: P, h2: -\n- **Rank 1**: `6K1` \u2192 a1-f1: -, g1: K, h1: -\n\nSo corrected:\n\n- **White pieces**:\n  - King: g1\n  - Queen: c2\n  - Rook: f4\n  - Bishop: e6, b2\n  - Pawns: b4, c5, g2, g6\n\n- **Black pieces**:\n  - King: h8\n  - Bishop: g7\n  - Knight: c3\n  - Queen: c4\n  - Rook: a2\n  - Pawns: c6, d5, h6, d4, h6\n\nWait \u2014 d4 has a black pawn, c4 has black queen. So black has two pawns on d5 and d4? That\u2019s possible \u2014 d5 and d4 are both occupied by black pawns? But in rank 4: `1Pqp1R2` \u2192 b4: P (white), c4: q (black), d4: p (black). So yes, black has pawns on d5 (rank 5) and d4 (rank 4). That\u2019s a pawn chain.\n\nBut d4 and d5 both occupied by black pawns \u2014 that\u2019s doubled pawns, but possible.\n\nNow, **White to move**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Material Count**\n\n- White: K, Q, R, 2B, 4 pawns (b4, c5, g2, g6) \u2192 1+9+5+2*3+4*1 = 9+5+6+4 = 24\n- Black: K, Q, R, B, N, 5 pawns (c6, d5, d4, h6, c4) \u2192 1+9+5+3+3+5 = 26\n\nSo Black is up a pawn, but White has active pieces.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Tactical and Positional Assessment**\n\nLet\u2019s look for **tactics**.\n\n#### **Key features**:\n\n- White\u2019s bishop on e6 is **attacking** the black king on h8 along the a2-g8 diagonal? Wait \u2014 e6 to h8 is diagonal? e6 \u2192 f7 \u2192 g8 \u2192 h9? No \u2014 e6 to h8 is **not diagonal**.\n\nWait: e6 is light-squared? e6: e-file, 6th rank.\n\nFrom e6, bishop moves diagonally:\n- NE: f7, g8 \u2014 g8 is empty, h9 invalid\n- SE: f5, g4, h3\n- SW: d5, c4, b5, a6\n- NW: d7, c8\n\nSo e6 bishop attacks:\n- g8? e6 \u2192 f7 \u2192 g8 \u2192 yes, g8 is on diagonal. But g8 is empty.\n- h8? e6 to h8: e6-f7-g8-h9? No, h9 invalid. e6 to h8 is 3 right, 2 up \u2192 not diagonal. So **no**, e6 does **not** attack h8.\n\nBut **g7** is occupied by black bishop. e6 attacks g7? e6 \u2192 f7 \u2192 g7? Yes! e6-f7-g7 is diagonal. So **Be6 attacks Bg7**.\n\nAlso, Be6 attacks:\n- d5 (black pawn)\n- c4 (black queen)\n- f5, g4, etc.\n\nSo **Be6 is attacking black queen on c4** \u2014 that\u2019s critical.\n\nc4 is attacked by Be6? e6 to c4: e6-d5-c4 \u2014 yes, same diagonal (light squares). So **Be6 is pinning or attacking c4 queen**.\n\nBut is it pinned? c4 queen is on c4, d5 has black pawn. So the pawn on d5 is on the same diagonal. So Be6 attacks d5 pawn and c4 queen.\n\nBut the queen is behind the pawn \u2014 so **the pawn is shielding the queen** from the bishop? No \u2014 from e6 to c4, the path is e6-d5-c4. So **d5 pawn is in the way**.\n\nSo **Be6 does NOT attack c4** \u2014 it is blocked by the black pawn on d5.\n\nSo Be6 attacks:\n- d5 (black pawn)\n- f5, g4, h3 (empty or occupied?)\n- f7, g8 (empty)\n- d7, c8 (empty)\n\nSo **no direct attack on queen or king**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 what about **Rf4**? It\u2019s on f4, attacking along the 4th rank.\n\nOn the 4th rank: a4 empty, b4 white pawn, c4 black queen, d4 black pawn, e4 empty, f4 white rook, g4 empty, h4 empty.\n\nSo Rf4 attacks c4 queen \u2014 **yes!** f4 to c4 is along the rank, and only b4 pawn is in between? No \u2014 b4 is on b4, c4 is c4 \u2014 so from f4 to c4: f4-e4-d4-c4.\n\nd4 has black pawn \u2014 so **blocked by d4 pawn**.\n\nSo Rf4 does **not** attack c4.\n\nBut Rf4 attacks e4, d4, c4 (blocked), and g4, h4.\n\nSo only attacks g4 and h4 (empty), and d4 (occupied by black pawn).\n\nSo Rf4 attacks d4 pawn.\n\nSimilarly, **Qc2** \u2014 where does it attack?\n\nc2: queen on c2.\n\nCan move along c-file, 2nd rank, and diagonals.\n\nc-file: c3 has black knight, c4 black queen \u2014 so attacks c3 and c4? c2-c3-c4: c3 has black knight, so queen attacks c3 knight and, if it were open, c4 \u2014 but c3 is occupied, so cannot go beyond.\n\nSo Qc2 attacks c3 (Nc"
