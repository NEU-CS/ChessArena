When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

But the position is very tense \u2014 both kings are exposed, and there are many pawns close to promotion.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Key Features\n\n- **White king on f1**, somewhat exposed, but not immediately threatened.\n- **Black king on d4**, deep in White's territory, very dangerous.\n- Black bishop on f2 is **attacking the White king** via the diagonal, but currently blocked by nothing \u2014 wait: f2-bishop is on f2, king on f1 \u2014 so **Bf2 is attacking the White king directly**!\n  - But is it protected? f2-bishop is on f2, White king on f1 \u2014 yes, it's **checking** the king!\n\nWait \u2014 **is Black in check? Or is White in check?**\n\nBlack to move? No \u2014 the FEN says `w`, so **White to move**.\n\nBut Black bishop on f2 attacks f1 \u2014 which is occupied by White king.\n\nSo **White king is in check** by the black bishop on f2.\n\nBut the FEN says it's White to move \u2014 that would be illegal unless the check is not real.\n\nLet\u2019s verify: Black bishop on f2, White king on f1 \u2014 same diagonal? f2 to f1 is vertical, not diagonal.\n\nWait \u2014 bishop moves diagonally.\n\nf2 to f1 is straight down \u2014 that\u2019s a **file**, not diagonal. So no, **bishop cannot attack along a file**.\n\nSo is the bishop attacking the king?\n\nFrom f2, diagonals are:\n- a7-g8 diagonal: f2, e3, d4, c5, b6, a7\n- h1-a8 diagonal: f2, g1, h0 (off board)\n\nSo f2 to g1 to h0 \u2014 g1 is empty, h1 is empty.\n\nSo **f2-bishop does NOT attack f1** \u2014 it's on the same file, but bishop can't move vertically.\n\nSo no check.\n\nBut what about **e3-pawn**? e3 pawn \u2014 can it capture anything? It's on e3, can capture diagonally to d4 or f4.\n\nd4 is occupied by Black king \u2014 no.\n\nf4 is empty.\n\nSo no immediate threat.\n\nBut **Black king is on d4**, very central and advanced.\n\nWhite king on f1 \u2014 passive.\n\nWhite has a **bishop on c2**, which can move to several squares.\n\nAlso, **g4g5** is a pawn push.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **key tactical ideas**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Candidate Moves\n\nWe must pick the best from:\n\n1. **c2h7** \u2014 Bishop to h7\n2. **c2g6**\n3. **c2f5**\n4. **c2e4**\n5. **c2d3**\n6. **c2d1**\n7. **c2b1**\n8. **f1g2** \u2014 King to g2\n9. **f1e2** \u2014 King to e2\n10. **g4g5** \u2014 Pawn to g5\n11. **h2h3**\n12. **h2h4**\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each with purpose.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **c2h7** \u2014 Bc2-h7\n\n- h7 is empty. Is there a purpose?\n- h7 is behind Black\u2019s pawns. h6 is Black pawn.\n- After Bh7, Black can play ...h6-h5, attacking the bishop.\n- Or if g7 were occupied, but it's not.\n- No immediate threat.\n- Bishop is far from action.\n- Probably a waste of time.\n\n**Low priority**.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **c2g6** \u2014 Bg6\n\n- g6 is empty.\n- Again, far from center.\n- Could support g4-g5 later?\n- But Black can play ...h6-h5, blocking.\n- Not urgent.\n\n**Passive**.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **c2f5** \u2014 Bf5\n\n- f5 is empty.\n- Controls key central squares.\n- Eyes e6, d7, and also the diagonal toward g4 and h3.\n- Also, **attacks e6**, which is behind d5-pawn \u2014 not immediately useful.\n- But more importantly: **does it prevent anything?**\n- Black king on d4 \u2014 can it go to e4? e4 is empty.\n- If Black king goes to e4, it threatens e3-e2+ and promotion.\n- But Bf5 doesn\u2019t stop that.\n\nWait \u2014 **Black has a pawn on e3**, one step from e2, then e1=Q.\n\nThat\u2019s **very dangerous**.\n\ne3 pawn is on e3, so **next move it can promote to e2**, and if not captured, becomes queen on e1.\n\nBut White moves first.\n\nSo **if White doesn\u2019t stop it, Black plays e3-e2 next move, and promotes**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **it's White's move now**.\n\nAfter White moves, Black will play.\n\nSo if White does **nothing**, Black plays **e3-e2**, and if the king or bishop doesn\u2019t capture, it promotes.\n\nBut after e2, White can play **Kf1-e1**, capturing the pawn.\n\nBut only if the king is able to.\n\nBut if the pawn promotes, it\u2019s e1=Q, and White king on f1 \u2014 **check!**\n\nSo **e3-e2=e1=Q+** is a **check**, and White must respond.\n\nSo **White must prevent e3-e2 if possible**, or be ready to capture.\n\nBut **can White prevent e3-e2?**\n\nOnly by **blocking** or **capturing**.\n\n- Can anything capture on e3? White bishop on c2 \u2014 c2 to e4? c2-e4 is a legal move.\n\nc2-e4: yes, diagonal from c2 to e4.\n\ne4 is empty.\n\nBut e4 is not e3.\n\nSo bishop cannot capture on e3.\n\nWhite king is on f1 \u2014 too far.\n\nNo other pieces.\n\nSo **White cannot prevent e3-e2**.\n\nBut after e2, White can play **Kxe2**, capturing the"
