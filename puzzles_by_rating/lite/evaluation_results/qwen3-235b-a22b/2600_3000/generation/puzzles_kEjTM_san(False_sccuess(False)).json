When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Only one square apart.\n- **White has a central pawn on f4**, Black has pawns on f7, g7, h7.\n- **Black has a passed pawn on a7**, but it's blocked by nothing directly \u2014 however, White has a3 and b2, so it's not free.\n- **White has a pawn on c3**, and **Black has a pawn on c4**, which is **advanced and potentially passed**.\n- **Black's king is in the center**, but exposed.\n- **White king is on d4**, very active.\n\n### Critical pawn structure:\n\n- **c4 is a black pawn**, advanced to the 4th rank.\n- **c3 is a white pawn**, on the 3rd rank.\n- So c4 is **blocking** c3. But if c3 advances to c4, it would be blocked by c4.\n- So **c4 is a protected passed pawn?** No \u2014 it's not passed, because White has a3 and b2 \u2014 but it's **advanced**.\n\nBut more importantly: **Black has a pawn on b5**, and **White has a pawn on a3**.\n\nSo the **a- and b-pawns** are locked.\n\nBut **c4 is a very strong pawn** \u2014 it's on the 4th rank, and if the kings stay, it could be a threat.\n\nBut the **kings are close**, and **king activity is crucial in endgames**.\n\nAlso, **White has a pawn on f4**, Black on f7 \u2014 so potential for f-pawn breaks.\n\nBut the **most important factor** is **king position and opposition**.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **king opposition**.\n\nWhite king on d4, Black king on d6.\n\nThey are on the same file, separated by one square (e5). So **Black has the distant opposition?** No \u2014 it's only one square apart \u2014 actually, **White has the opposition** because it's Black to move.\n\nWait: **Opposition** \u2014 when kings are on the same file, separated by one square, and it's the **other player's turn**, then the player **not to move** has the opposition.\n\nSo here: kings on d6 and d4 \u2014 separated by d5.\n\nIt's **Black to move** \u2014 so **White has the opposition**.\n\nThat means **Black must be careful not to allow White to gain space or penetrate**.\n\nIf Black moves the king away, White might occupy d5 or e5 or c5, gaining central control.\n\nBut Black has **pawn moves** too \u2014 perhaps to create a passed pawn or improve structure.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the **candidate moves**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate King Moves\n\n**1. d6e7** \u2014 king to e7  \n- Retreats to e7, away from center.\n- Loses control of d5, e5, c5.\n- Allows White king to go to d5 or e5 easily.\n- Not ideal \u2014 king is going backward.\n\n**2. d6d7** \u2014 king to d7  \n- Slightly backward, but still central.\n- Keeps pressure on d5? Not really \u2014 still allows Kd5.\n- But supports c6 or b6 later.\n- Less bad than e7.\n\n**3. d6c7** \u2014 king to c7  \n- Heading toward queenside.\n- Might support b5 or a7 pawn.\n- But abandons central control.\n- White can play Kd5, then Kc6, winning c4 pawn?\n\nWait \u2014 if Black king goes to c7, White plays Kd5, then Kxc4? But c4 is defended by b5? No \u2014 b5 is on b5, doesn't defend c4.\n\nc4 is **only defended by the king** if it's on d6 or c6 or d5.\n\nSo if Black king leaves d6, **c4 pawn is hanging**?\n\nWait \u2014 is c4 attacked?\n\nCurrently, c4 is on c4, White has no piece attacking it \u2014 but if Black king moves, and White king goes to d5, then **Kd5 attacks c4**.\n\nBut c4 is **not defended** by any pawn \u2014 b5 is on b5, which doesn't defend c4 (diagonally? b5 attacks c4? Yes! b5 is on b5, c4 is on c4 \u2014 that's a diagonal.\n\nb5 \u2192 c4: yes, **b5 pawn attacks c4**.\n\nSo **c4 is defended by b5 pawn**.\n\nSo even if king moves, **c4 is still defended**.\n\nSo c4 is **not hanging**.\n\nBut if White captures c4, Black recaptures with b5, but then b5 is gone, and a7 pawn might become more important.\n\nBut still, c4 is **supported**.\n\nSo king can move.\n\nBut **central king is important**.\n\n**4. d6e6** \u2014 king to e6  \n- Keeps central control.\n- Eyes e5, f6, d5.\n- Supports f5 break later.\n- Good square.\n\n**5. d6c6** \u2014 king to c6  \n- Central, supports b5, c4, d5.\n- Very active.\n- Eyes b6, d6, c5, d7.\n- Also protects c4 directly.\n- Strong.\n\nSo king"
