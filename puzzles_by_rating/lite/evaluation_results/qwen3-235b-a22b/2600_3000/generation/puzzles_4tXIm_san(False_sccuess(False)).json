If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

But there is no h-pawn!\n  - Black has no h-pawn. So advancing the king to h4 or h2 doesn't create a passed pawn.\n  - But the king can attack g4 or g5 if it gets close.\n\nWait \u2014 Black\u2019s king is on h3. If it goes to h4, and White plays gxh4, then Black can recapture with king: Kxh4. Then the g5 pawn is isolated.\n\nBut White might not want to capture.\n\nAlternatively, Black king might try to penetrate via g3 or f4.\n\nBut White\u2019s king is on f3, which is well placed.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each legal move.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n#### 1. **h3h4**\n- King moves to h4.\n- If White plays g5xh4, then Kxh4 \u2014 Black king captures.\n- Then White has pawns on g4, but now g5 is gone.\n- After Kxh4, White can play Kf4, attacking the e5 pawn or supporting g4.\n- But Black might play ...e5-e4+? Let's see:\n  - After h3-h4, g5xh4, Kxh4, then Kf4, and now e5-e4+? But e4+ would be met by Kxe4, and then d6-d5, but White has d5 pawn.\n  - Complicated.\n- But more importantly: is h4 safe? White can play g4-g5 at some point, but it's already on g5.\n- After h3-h4, if White does **not** capture, then g5-g6 might be possible? But g6 is occupied by Black pawn.\n- So g5-g6 is blocked.\n- So White cannot push g6.\n- But if Black plays h3-h4, and White ignores, Black king is on h4, eyeing g5 and g4.\n- But no immediate breakthrough.\n- However, **this move might allow White to play g4-g5!** Wait \u2014 g4 and g5 are both occupied. So g4-g5 is not possible \u2014 already on g5.\n- So g4-g5 is impossible.\n- Only g5-g6 is possible, but blocked by g6 pawn.\n- So the kingside is locked unless someone captures.\n\nBut if Black plays h3-h4, and White plays g5xh4, then Kxh4, now Black has a path to g3 or f4.\n\nBut White can respond with Kf4, and the position is tense.\n\nBut is this the best?\n\nWait \u2014 **h3-h4 might be a blunder** because after g5xh4, Kxh4, then White plays c4-c5! Opening the queenside.\n\nBut let\u2019s hold that thought.\n\n#### 2. **h3h2**\n- King retreats to h2.\n- This is passive. King moves away from the action.\n- Why would Black want this? Maybe to avoid g5-g6 if Black plays ...g6-g5? But g5 is occupied.\n- No clear purpose.\n- Loses king activity.\n- Likely inferior.\n\n#### 3. **c7c6**\n- Prepares to support ...b7-b5 or ...c6-c5.\n- Solid, but slow.\n- White can play c4-c5! immediately after, opening the c-file.\n- After c7-c6, White plays c4-c5, then d6xc5, d5-d6! and White gets a dangerous passed pawn.\n- For example:\n  - 1...c7-c6 2. c4-c5! d6xc5 3. d5-d6! c5-c4? 4. d6-d7, and the pawn promotes.\n  - Even if Black doesn\u2019t play ...c4, d6-d7 is coming.\n- So ...c7-c6 might be dangerous because it allows c4-c5 with tempo.\n\n#### 4. **b7b6**\n- Similar idea: prepares ...c7-c5 or ...b6-b5.\n- But again, after b7-b6, White can play c4-c5! b6xc5, d5-d6! again.\n- Same idea: d6 is attacked, but if c7 is not defending d6, d5-d6 wins a pawn or promotes.\n- After b7-b6, c4-c5, b6xc5, d5-d6! c7-c6? d6-d7, and the pawn is unstoppable.\n- So this also allows d5-d6.\n\n#### 5. **a6a5**\n- Queenside pawn move.\n- Prevents b4-b5? But b4-b5 might not be useful.\n- Weakens b6 square.\n- Doesn\u2019t address central or kingside tension.\n- Passive.\n- Not compelling.\n\n#### 6. **e5e4**\n- Pushes the e-pawn.\n- Attacks f3 king? e4+ would be check if the king is on f3"
