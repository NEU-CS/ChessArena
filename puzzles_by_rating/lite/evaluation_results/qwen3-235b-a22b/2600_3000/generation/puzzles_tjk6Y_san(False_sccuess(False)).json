When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Q  .  .  .  .  . \n5 | .  . .  . d  . q  .  . \n4 | .  . .  . .  n  .  . \n3 | .  . .  . .  .  . b  .  .  .  g\n2 | P  P  .  .  .  P  .  P\n1 | R  N  .  .  .  R  K  .\n    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 let's reconstruct accurately.\n\nFrom FEN: `8/p2r1kpp/2Q5/3p1q2/4n3/6Pb/PP3P1P/RN3RK1`\n\nRow by row (rank 8 to 1):\n\n- **8**: `8` \u2192 empty\n- **7**: `p2r1kpp` \u2192 p . . r . k p p\n- **6**: `2Q5` \u2192 . . Q . . . . .\n- **5**: `3p1q2` \u2192 . . . d . q . .\n- **4**: `4n3` \u2192 . . . . n . . .\n- **3**: `6Pb` \u2192 . . . . . . P b\n- **2**: `PP3P1P` \u2192 P P . . . P . P\n- **1**: `RN3RK1` \u2192 R N . . . R K .\n\nSo corrected board:\n\n```\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n8 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n7 | p  .  .  r  .  k  p  p\n6 | .  .

R  K  .\n```\n\nNow we can see:\n\n### **Key features:**\n\n- **White queen on c6**, very active, attacking along the 6th rank and diagonals.\n- **Black king on f7**, exposed, in the center.\n- **Black queen on f5**, active.\n- **Black rook on d7**, defending the 7th rank.\n- **Black knight on e4**, central, attacking f2 and possibly c3/d6.\n- **White has a discovered attack possibility?**\n- **White\u2019s queen on c6 is unprotected** \u2014 if it moves, it might be captured?\n  - But who can capture it? Black has:\n    - a7 pawn \u2014 no\n    - d5 pawn \u2014 no\n    - e4 knight \u2014 no\n    - f5 queen \u2014 yes! c6 is on the same diagonal as f5 via c6-a4-f5? Wait: c6 to f5 is not a straight line.\n      - c6 to f5: difference of 3 files right, 1 rank up \u2192 not diagonal. So not on same diagonal.\n      - c6 to f5: vector (3,1) \u2014 not a queen move. So **Black queen cannot capture on c6**.\n    - h3 bishop \u2014 no\n    - d7 rook \u2014 no\n    - a7 pawn \u2014 no\n\nSo **White queen on c6 is safe** \u2014 no black piece can capture it immediately.\n\nBut if White moves the queen, does it leave something hanging?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **tactical motifs**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Look for checks, captures, threats**\n\nWhite has a **queen on c6**, which can:\n\n- Move to **c8+** \u2014 check! (attacking along the c-file)\n- Move to **d7** \u2014 **captures rook**!\n- Move to **e6**, **f6**, **g6**, **h6** \u2014 all on 6th rank\n- Also, **c6-d5** \u2014 captures pawn\n- **c6xe4** \u2014 knight on e4? c6 to e4 is two files right, two ranks up \u2014 that\u2019s a knight move, not queen. So no.\n\nSo queen **cannot** take e4.\n\nBut **c6xd7** is a **capture** \u2014 rook on d7.\n\nBut is that safe?\n\nAfter **Qxd7**, Black can play **Qf5xc2**, attacking White\u2019s undefended b2 and a2 pawns? c2 is occupied by White\u2019s queen? No \u2014 White\u2019s queen is on c6.\n\nAfter Qc6xd7, then Qf5xc2 \u2014 yes, c2 is undefended.\n\nBut is that check? No. But it wins a pawn.\n\nBut more importantly: **after Qc6xd7, Black plays Qf5-f1+!** \u2014 check!\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- Qc6xd7, then Qf5-f1+\n- White king on g1 \u2014 f1 is adjacent, so yes: Qf1+ checks the king.\n- Then White must play Kxf1 \u2014 king captures queen.\n- But then Black plays Rxd7 \u2014 rook recaptures.\n\nSo material: Q for Q and R \u2014 White loses queen for rook and queen \u2014 no, wait:\n\nSequence:\n\n1. Qc6xd7? Rxd7 \u2014 no, Black doesn't have to recapture immediately.\n\nWait \u2014 better:\n\n1. Qc6xd7?? Qf5-f1+!\n2. Kxf1 Rxd7\n\nNow White has lost queen, Black has lost queen, but Black has rook vs nothing \u2014 Black is up a rook.\n\nSo **Qc6xd7?? loses the queen to a skewer or pin tactic** \u2014 because after Qc6 leaves the first rank, the f1 rook and king are exposed.\n\nSo **Qc6xd7 is a blunder** due to **Qf1+**.\n\nSimilarly, **Qc6-c8+**?\n\nTry: **Qc6-c8+**\n\n- Checks the king on f7.\n- King must move: Kf7-e7 or Kf7-f6 or Kf7-g8\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- Kf7-e7: possible\n- Kf7-f6: possible\n- Kf7-g8: possible\n\nBut after **Qc8+**, what happens?\n\nSuppose: 1. Qc8+ Ke7\n\nThen White can play Qc8-c7 \u2014 attacking rook on d7 and threatening mate?\n\nWait \u2014 is there a mating net?\n\nAlternatively, **Qc8+ forces the king to move**, possibly exposing it.\n\nBut Black can play Ke7, and then White has Qc7, attacking d7 and threatening mate on f8 or something?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s look deeper.\n\nBut better idea: **is there a forced mate?**\n\nLook at **Qc6-e6+**?\n\nQe6+ \u2014 check on e6.\n\nKing must go to f6 or f8.\n\nf8: Kf7-f8\n\nf6: Kf7-f6\n\nIf Kf6, then Qe6+ forces king to f6, but then Qe6 is attacked by Qf5?\n\nQe6 and Qf5 are on adjacent squares \u2014 queen on f5 can capture on e6.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Qc6-e6+ Kf7-f6\n2. Qe6-e8? No \u2014 Qf5xe6!\n\nSo **Qe6+?? loses queen to Qf5xe6**.\n\nSo **Qe6+ is bad**.\n\nSimilarly, **Qf6+?** Qc6-f6+?\n\nThen Kf7-g8 or Kf7-f8\n\nIf Kf7-g8, then Qf6-g6+? But Black has Qf5-f6 to block?\n\nWait \u2014 Qc6-f6+ Kf7-g8\n\nThen Qf6-g6+? But Qf5 can go to f6 to block? Yes \u2014 Qf5-f6.\n\nSo not effective.\n\nBut what about **Qc6-h6**?\n\nQh6 \u2014 threatens Qh6-h7+? But h7 is occupied by black pawn.\n\nQh6-h7+? gxh7 \u2014 then no follow-up.\n\nNot strong.\n\nWait \u2014 **what about discovered attack**?\n\nWhite has rook on"
