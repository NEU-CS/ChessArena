Both are on the same file (f/h), but not directly opposing.\n- Black's king is on g4 \u2014 very advanced, near White's pawns.\n- White's king is on e4 \u2014 central, but not very active.\n- Black's bishop is on g1 \u2014 trapped in the corner, but can become active.\n- White's bishop is on e1 \u2014 also passive.\n- Black has a pawn on b7 \u2014 potential to promote if advanced.\n- White has a pawn on f2 \u2014 also could promote, but Black's king is closer.\n\n**Key ideas**:\n- **Black's king is very active** \u2014 it's near White's pawns and can potentially stop the f-pawn from promoting.\n- **White's king is not near the b-pawn**, so Black might be able to push the b-pawn to promotion if not stopped.\n- However, **White's f5 pawn is close to queening**, but Black's king is on g4 \u2014 can it stop it?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n- f5-f6-f7-f8: 3 moves to promotion.\n- Black king on g4: to f7 (to stop f8) would take: g4-f5-e6-f7 (3 moves) \u2014 same as pawn. But if White plays f6, king can go g4-f5, then e6, then f7? Wait:\n\nActually:\n- f5-f6 (1), f6-f7 (2), f7-f8 (3)\n- g4-f5 (1), f5-e6 (2), e6-f7 (3) \u2014 yes, can reach f7 in time.\n\nBut if White has time to support with king or bishop, it might promote.\n\nBut Black has a **distant passed pawn on the queenside** \u2014 the b7 pawn.\n\nWhite's king is on e4 \u2014 to stop b7-b5-b4-b3-b2-b1=Q, it would take:\n- e4-d5-c6-b7: 4 moves to b7\n- b7-b5 (1), b5-b4 (2), b3 (3), b2 (4), b1 (5) \u2014 so 5 moves.\n\nSo White king can reach b7 in 4 moves, but pawn takes 4 moves to reach b1 (b7-b5, b5-b4, b4-b3, b3-b2, b2-b1: 4 moves after b7-b5).\n\nWait: b7 to b5 is one move (if allowed), then b4, b3, b2, b1 \u2014 5 total.\n\nBut b7-b5 is a two-square first move \u2014 so:\n- b7-b5 (1)\n- b5-b4 (2)\n- b4-b3 (3)\n- b3-b2 (4)\n- b2-b1 (5)\n\nWhite king: e4-d5-c6-b7 \u2014 3 moves to b7.\n\nSo if Black plays b7-b5 now, White king can go e4-d5-c6-b7 and capture the pawn before it advances.\n\nBut Black can **distract** White with the king on the kingside or the h-pawn.\n\nAlternatively, **Black might not need to promote the b-pawn** \u2014 maybe the **h-pawn** is more dangerous?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **h-pawn**:\n- h5-h4 (1), h4-h3 (2), h3-h2 (3), h2-h1=Q (4)\n- White has bishop on e1, king on e4 \u2014 both far away.\n- Can White stop it?\n\nAfter h5-h4, White might play f5-f6, threatening quick promotion.\n\nBut Black\u2019s king is on g4 \u2014 can it support h4-h3?\n\nYes: g4-g3 or g4-h3.\n\nBut White might promote first.\n\nLet\u2019s compare promotion races.\n\n**White's f5 pawn**:\n- f5-f6 (1)\n- f6-f7 (2)\n- f7-f8=Q (3)\n\n**Black's h5 pawn**:\n- h5-h4 (1)\n- h4-h3 (2)\n- h3-h2 (3)\n- h2-h1=Q (4)\n\nSo White promotes one move faster.\n\nBut if Black can **check** upon promotion, it might matter.\n\nBut Black\u2019s bishop is on g1 \u2014 if h2-h1=Q, queen can check, but White might have time to promote first.\n\nBut Black can **interfere** with the f-pawn.\n\nFor example, if Black plays g4-g5, attacking f5 pawn?\n\ng4-g5: king moves to g5 \u2014 attacks f5 pawn.\n\nYes! That\u2019s critical.\n\nCurrently, f5 pawn is **unprotected**.\n\nWhite\u2019s pieces:\n- King on e4 \u2014 too far\n- Bishop on e1 \u2014 can\u2019t defend f5\n- f2 pawn \u2014 irrelevant\n\nSo f5 pawn is **hanging** if Black plays g4-g5.\n\nIs g4-g5 a legal move? Yes \u2014 it's in the list: `g4g5`.\n\nAfter `g4g5`, Black captures the f5 pawn: g5xf5.\n\nThen White has no pawn on f5 \u2014 promotion race gone.\n\nWhite\u2019s only pawn is f2 \u2014 which is far from promoting.\n\nBlack still has h5 and b7 pawns.\n\nSo this seems very strong.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate:\n\n### Candidate move: `g4g5`\n\n1. g4-g5\n   - Attacks f5 pawn\n   - After g5xf5, White cannot recapture (no piece can)\n   - So Black wins a pawn\n\nIs there any downside?\n\n- King moves to g5 \u2014 still active\n- No immediate threat to Black king\n\nWhite\u2019s response?\n- King e4-f4? To go after Black\u2019s h5 pawn or f5 pawn?\n- But Black can play h5-h4, starting a passed pawn.\n\nAfter g5xf5, Black has:\n- King on g5\n- Pawn on h5, b7\n- Bishop on g1\n\nWhite has:\n- King on e4\n- Bishop on e1\n- Pawn on f2\n\nBlack can play h5-h4, then h4-h3, and threaten to queen.\n\nWhite\u2019s king is far \u2014 e4 to h3 is many moves.\n\nBlack might even push b-pawn later.\n\nSo material: Black is up a pawn, and has two passed pawns.\n\nThis is **winning** for Black.\n\nNow, let\u2019s check if other moves are better.\n\n---\n\n### Compare other moves:\n\n#### `g4h4` \u2014 King to h4\n- Doesn\u2019t attack f5\n- King moves to edge\n- Doesn\u2019t gain material\n- Might support h5-h4 later, but not urgent\n- Less active than g5\n\nWorse than g4g5.\n\n#### `g4h3` \u2014 King to h3\n- Even more edge\n- Might support h-pawn, but again, f5 still stands\n- Not capturing the free pawn\n- Too slow\n\n#### `g1h2` \u2014 Bishop to h2\n- Develops bishop slightly\n- But doesn't threaten anything\n- Loses time\n- f5 still not attacked\n\n#### `g1f2` \u2014 Bishop to f2\n- Blocks White\u2019s f2 pawn? But f2 pawn is not moving anyway\n- Bishop is still passive\n- No gain\n\n#### `b7b6` \u2014 b-pawn to b"
