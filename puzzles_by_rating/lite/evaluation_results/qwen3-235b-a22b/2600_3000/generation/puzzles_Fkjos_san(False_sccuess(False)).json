Black\u2019s king is exposed near the center, but White must avoid stalemate or letting Black promote or draw by insufficient material.\n\nWhite has a bishop and king vs. king and two pawns (a5, e5). Black\u2019s pawns are on a5 and e5 \u2014 both potentially dangerous if not controlled.\n\nBut note: Black\u2019s king is on e3 \u2014 very close to queening on e1! The e5-pawn is blocked, but if Black ever gets ...e4 and then ...e3-e2-e1, it could promote.\n\nHowever, it's White to move, and White can act decisively.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the **key threats**:\n\n- Black\u2019s king is on e3. If White\u2019s bishop were not on c6, Black could play ...e4, then ...e2, etc.\n- But currently, Black has no legal move \u2014 it's White\u2019s turn.\n- White must prevent ...e4 and also try to support the idea of capturing Black\u2019s pawns or forcing promotion while avoiding stalemate.\n\nBut more importantly: **Can White force a win?**\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **bishop moves** and **king moves**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate the position\n\nWhite\u2019s bishop is on c6, controlling the a8\u2013h1 diagonal. It currently attacks:\n- a8, b7, d5, e4, f3, g2, h1\n\nBut more importantly, it **controls the queening square of the e5-pawn**: e1.\n\nIf Black ever plays ...e4-e3-e2, then e2-e1=Q, but White\u2019s bishop controls e1 \u2014 so if White can keep the bishop on a square that controls e1, Black cannot promote without capture.\n\nBut White must be careful: if the bishop leaves the diagonal, Black might promote.\n\nAlso, Black has a pawn on a5 \u2014 far away, but if not captured, it might become a problem.\n\nBut Black\u2019s king is on e3 \u2014 very close to a5? No, it's far. So Black cannot support a5 easily.\n\nWhite\u2019s king is on g5 \u2014 close to e5? Not really. But it can march toward e5 or a5.\n\nBut the **most urgent issue** is: **Can White stop Black from promoting the e-pawn?**\n\nCurrently, Black cannot move ...e4 because e4 is attacked by the bishop on c6 (c6-e4 diagonal). So e4 is **controlled**.\n\nSo:\n- ...e4 is illegal for Black (if it were their move) because e4 is attacked? No \u2014 pawns can move to attacked squares; it's just dangerous.\n\nWait: a pawn can move forward to an attacked square \u2014 it's just that it would be captured. But in this case, if Black plays ...e4, then White can play Bxe4, winning the pawn.\n\nSo Black playing ...e4 is bad \u2014 loses the pawn.\n\nBut what about ...e4-e3? That would be worse \u2014 e3 is occupied by the king.\n\nSo Black\u2019s e5-pawn is **blocked** and cannot advance safely.\n\nSimilarly, a5 is blocked by nothing, but no black piece is supporting it.\n\nBut Black\u2019s king is on e3 \u2014 far from a5.\n\nSo Black cannot make progress.\n\nBut it's **White to move**, and White must avoid **stalemate**.\n\nWait \u2014 is the position close to stalemate?\n\nLet\u2019s see: if White makes a move that doesn't attack any square Black\u2019s king can go to, and Black has no legal moves, it\u2019s stalemate.\n\nBlack\u2019s king is on e3. Where can it go?\n\ne3: attacked by?  \n- d4 (no piece), d3, d2, e2, f2, f3, f4, e4 \u2014 all empty.\n\nCurrently, no piece attacks e3.\n\nBut after White moves, we must ensure Black still has a legal move \u2014 unless we are checkmating.\n\nBut we are not giving check in most moves.\n\nWait \u2014 can we **check** the Black king?\n\nYes \u2014 if the bishop moves to e4, that would be **Be4+**, attacking e3.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate move: c6e4 (Bishop to e4)\n\nThis move:\n- Attacks e3 (check!)\n- Controls e1 (still covers promotion square)\n- Is on the diagonal toward g2, h3, etc.\n\nAfter **1. Be4+**, Black must move the king.\n\nWhere can Ke3 go?\n\n- d2: is it attacked? Be4 controls d3, c4, b5, a6 \u2014 not d2.\n- d3: Be4 controls d3? Yes \u2014 diagonal from e4 to d3? e4-d3 is diagonal \u2014 yes, same color? e4 is light, d3 is dark \u2014 no. Wait: c6 is light square (c-file dark, 6th rank even \u2192 light), so bishop is on light-squared diagonal.\n\ne4 is a light square. d3 is a dark square \u2014 so bishop on e4 (light) cannot attack d3 (dark).\n\nWait \u2014 no: bishop moves diagonally \u2014 each diagonal is same color.\n\nc6 is light square (c-file is 3rd, odd; 6th rank even \u2192 odd+even = odd \u2192 dark? Wait, let's double-check:\n\nStandard coloring: a1 is dark.\n\nSo:\n- a1: dark\n- b1: light\n- c1: dark\n- d1: light\n- e1: dark\n- f1: light\n- g1: dark\n- h1: light\n\nSo:\n- c6: c-file (3rd), 6th rank \u2192 3+6=9 \u2192 odd \u2192 dark square\n- So bishop is on a **dark-square** bishop.\n\nTherefore, it controls dark squares.\n\nSo c6 \u2192 e4: c6 (dark), d5 (light), e4 (dark) \u2014 yes, same color \u2014 so e4 is dark \u2014 yes, bishop can go there.\n\nNow, does Be4 attack e3?\n\ne3 is light square (e-file 5, 3rd rank \u2192 5+3=8 \u2192 even \u2192 light). So e3 is light, Be4 is on dark \u2014 cannot attack light square.\n\nSo **Be4 does NOT attack e3**.\n\nWait \u2014 this is critical.\n\nThe bishop on c6 is on a dark square, so it moves on dark squares.\n\ne3 is a light square \u2014 so **the bishop cannot ever attack e3**.\n\nTherefore, **no check is possible with the bishop**.\n\nSimilarly, the king on g5 \u2014 can it attack e3? g5 to e3 is two files and two ranks \u2014 not adjacent.\n\nSo no check possible from king either.\n\nSo **White cannot give check** in this position.\n\nTherefore, **no forcing move via check**.\n\nSo we must make a quiet move.\n\nBut we must avoid **stalemate**.\n\nIs Black in **zugzwang**? That is, any move Black makes would be bad?\n\nBut currently, Black has no legal move? Let's see.\n\nBlack to move (if it were):\n\n- King on e3: can go to d2, d3, d4, e2, e4, f2, f3, f4 \u2014 all empty.\n- e5-pawn: can move to e4? e4 is empty \u2014 yes.\n- a5-pawn: can move to a4? yes.\n\nSo Black has many legal moves \u2014 not stalemated.\n\nBut after White moves, we must not **cause stalemate**.\n\nSo if White makes a move that blocks all of Black\u2019s pawn moves and restricts the king, it might be stalemate.\n\nFor example, if White plays a move that blocks a5-a4 and e5-e4, and also cuts off king moves, it could be stalemate.\n\nBut currently, a4 and e4 are free.\n\nSo we must be cautious.\n\nBut our goal is to **win**.\n\nHow?\n\nWhite has two pawns to deal with: a5 and e5.\n\nBut White has only a bishop and king.\n\nThe bishop is on c6 \u2014 it can potentially capture e5 or go to a4 to stop a5-a4.\n\nBut Black\u2019s king is close to e5 \u2014 on e3.\n\nSo if White tries to take e5, Black might recapture? No \u2014 king on e3 can take back if Bxe5, but only if e3 can go to e4 or d5.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nIf White plays Bxe5, then"
