When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

If Black gets to promote, they will have a queen.\n- Currently, Black\u2019s rook is on a2, protecting b2. So b2 is defended.\n- But White can **capture on b2**? Let\u2019s see: no White piece attacks b2 directly.\n\nWhite\u2019s pieces:\n- Rook on c8: on open file, but currently passive.\n- Rook on d6: very active, attacking along the 6th rank.\n- King on f3: near center, but not under immediate threat.\n- Pawns on g4 and h3: potential to advance.\n\n### Immediate concern: **Can White stop b2 promotion?**\n\nb2 is protected by Black\u2019s rook on a2. So if White plays something like cxb2+, then Black recaptures with Rxb2.\n\nBut after **cxb2+**, Black plays **Rxb2**, and now White has no immediate way to stop ...Rb1 or ...Rb1+ and promote.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after **cxb2+**, Black must recapture with **Rxb2**, and then White can play **Rd4+**, attacking the king and threatening the rook.\n\nLet\u2019s explore that.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s look at **White\u2019s goal**: prevent Black\u2019s promotion and/or win material.\n\nAlternatively, **can White force a win by attacking the Black king or cutting off the rook?**\n\nLet\u2019s look at **tactical ideas**.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate moves:\n\nWe are given the legal moves:\n\n```\nc8h8, c8g8, c8f8, c8e8, c8d8, c8b8, c8a8, c8c7,\nd6d8, d6d7, d6g6, d6f6, d6e6, d6c6, d6b6, d6a6, d6d5, d6d4, d6d3, d6d2, d6d1,\nf3f4, f3e4, f3g3, f3e3, f3g2, f3f2, f3e2,\ng4g5, h3h4\n```\n\nLet\u2019s analyze key ideas.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Can White win the b2 pawn?**\n\nTry: **c8b8?** \u2014 Rook to b8.\n\nAfter **1. c8b8**, Black plays **Rb2!**, attacking the rook. Then White must move it, and Black promotes next move: b1=Q.\n\nSo **c8b8?** loses immediately.\n\nSimilarly, **c8a8?** \u2014 same idea, Rb2 again attacks.\n\nSo moving the c8 rook to the a-file or b-file is bad.\n\nWhat about **c8c7?** \u2014 attacking c7 pawn.\n\nBut c7 is defended by nothing? Wait \u2014 c7 is a Black pawn. Is it defended?\n\nc7 pawn: attacked by White rook on c8 if it moves to c7? But c7 is on Black\u2019s side.\n\nAfter **c8c7**, rook takes c7 pawn.\n\nIs that safe?\n\nLet\u2019s see: **1. c8c7**\n\nNow Black can play **Rb2!**, threatening b1=Q.\n\nWhite cannot prevent promotion: after **Rb2**, b1=Q is unstoppable unless White plays **c7c4+** or something, but rook on c7 can\u2019t go to c4.\n\nRook on c7 is on c7, king is on c4 \u2014 so **c7c4+** is possible!\n\nWait: **1. c8c7 Rb2 2. c7c4+!**\n\nNow **2... Kd5** (only move, since Kd3? Rb1+ wins)\n\nThen **3. c4xb2**, and White wins the rook!\n\nLet\u2019s trace:\n\n- 1. c8c7 Rb2!\n- 2. c7c4+ Kd5 (Kb5? c4b3+ skewers king and rook)\n- 3. c4xb2\n\nNow Black has no promotion, and lost a rook.\n\nBut after 3... Rb1, trying to promote anyway? No \u2014 b2 is now occupied by White rook.\n\nSo Black has no more threats.\n\nWhite is up a rook and a pawn.\n\nSo this seems **very strong**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **c8c7** legal? Yes, it's in the list.\n\nBut let\u2019s verify: rook on c8 to c7 \u2014 yes, same file, no pieces in between? c7 has a Black pawn.\n\nSo **c8c7** captures the c7 pawn.\n\nYes.\n\nBut after **1. c8c7**, Black has **Rb2!**, threatening immediate promotion.\n\nWhite must respond with **c7c4+**, checking the king.\n\nNow, king on c4 \u2014 can it go to b5? c5? d5?\n\nAfter **c7c4+**, king must move.\n\n- Kb5? Then **c4b3+**! forks king and rook \u2014 Black must lose the rook.\n- Kc5? Then **c4b3** attacks b2 \u2014 but b2 is still defended by rook on b2? Wait \u2014 rook is on b2, so b2 is defended.\n\nWait \u2014 after **1. c8c7 Rb2 2. c7c4+**\n\nIf **2... Kc5**, then **3. c4b3**, attacking b2.\n\nBut b2 is defended by Rb2, so White can\u2019t take.\n\nBut now"
