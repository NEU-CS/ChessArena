When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Board Visualization**\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the board:\n\n```\n8:  -  r  -  -  -  -  k  -\n7:  -  -  -  -  e  p  -  p\n6:  -  -  -  -  -  -  p  -\n5:  -  -  B  N  P  -  -  -\n4:  -  -  p  -  -  -  -  -\n3:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  h\n2:  P  r  -  -  -  -  p  -\n1:  -  -  -  R  Q  -  K  -\n\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 let's double-check the FEN:\n\n`1r4k1/4pp1p/6p1/2BNP3/2p5/7P/Prq3P1/3RQ1K1`\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- **Rank 8**: `1r4k1` \u2192 [1][r][4][k][1] \u2192 `- r - - - - k -`\n- **Rank 7**: `4pp1p` \u2192 [4][p][p][1][p] \u2192 `- - - - p p - p`\n- **Rank 6**: `6p1` \u2192 [6][p][1] \u2192 `- - - - - - p -`\n- **Rank 5**: `2BNP3` \u2192 [2][B][N][P][3] \u2192 `- - B N P - - -`\n- **Rank 4**: `2p5` \u2192 [2][p][5] \u2192 `- - p - - - - -`\n- **Rank 3**: `7P` \u2192 [7][P] \u2192 `- - - - - - - P`\n- **Rank 2**: `Prq3P1` \u2192 [P][r][q][3][P][1] \u2192 `P r q - - - P -`\n- **Rank 1**: `3RQ1K1` \u2192 [3][R][Q][1][K][1] \u2192 `- - - R Q - K -`\n\nSo corrected board:\n\n```\n8:  -  r  -  -  -  -  k  -\n7:  -  -  -  -  p  p  -  p\n6:  -  -  -  -  -  -  p  -\n5:  -  -  B  N  P  -  -  -\n4:  -  -  p  -  -  -  -  -\n3:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  h\n2:  P  r  q  -  -  -  p  -\n1:  -  -  -  R  Q  -  K  -\n\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 rank 2: `Prq3P1` \u2192 a2: P, b2: r, c2: q, f2: P, g2: -? No \u2014 `3P1` means three empty, then P, then one empty \u2192 so f2: P, h2: -? No:\n\nWait: `Prq3P1` = P, r, q, [3 empty], P, [1 empty] \u2192 so:\n\n- a2: P\n- b2: r\n- c2: q\n- d2: -\n- e2: -\n- f2: -\n- g2: P\n- h2: -\n\nBut the FEN says `Prq3P1` \u2192 that\u2019s 8 squares: P, r, q, (3), P, (1) \u2192 yes: a2=P, b2=r, c2=q, d2-e2-f2=empty, g2=P, h2=empty.\n\nAnd rank 1: `3RQ1K1` \u2192 3 empty, R, Q, 1 empty, K, 1 empty \u2192 d1=R, e1=Q, g1=K\n\nSo final correct board:\n\n```\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n8:  -  r  -  -  -  -  k  -\n7:  -  -  -  -  p  p  -  p\n6:  -  -  -  -  -  -  p  -\n5:  -  -  B  N  P  -  -  -\n4:  -  -  p  -  -  -  -  -\n3:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  h\n2:  P  r  q  -  -  -  p  -\n1:  -  -  -  R  Q  -  K  -\n```\n\nWhite pieces:\n- King: g1\n- Queen: e1\n- Rook: d1\n- Bishop: d5\n- Knight: d5 (wait \u2014 d5 has both B and N? No \u2014 FEN says `2BNP3` \u2192 so d5: B, e5: N? No \u2014 wait:\n\n`2BNP3` \u2192 two empty, then B, N, P, then three empty \u2192 so:\n\n- c5: B\n- d5: N\n- e5: P\n\nAh! Correction: **c5 = Bishop**, **d5 = Knight**, **e5 = Pawn**\n\nSo:\n- White: Bc5, Nd5, e5, h3, g2, a2, g1, Qe1, Rd1\n- Black: Rb8, Rb2, Qc2, c4, f7, e7, g6, h7, g7, h7, Kg8\n\nWait \u2014 f7, e7, g7, h7 are all black pawns.\n\nSo corrected:\n\n```\n8:  -  r  -  -  -  -  k  -\n7:  -  -  -  -  p  p  -  h\n6:  -  -  -  -  -  -  p  -\n5:  -  -  B  N  P  -  -  -\n4:  -  -  p  -  -  -  -  -\n3:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  h\n2:  P  r  q  -  -  -  p  -\n1:  -  -  -  R  Q  -  K  -\n```\n\nNow, material:\n\n- White: K, Q, R, B, N, 4 pawns (a2, e5, g2, h3)\n- Black: K, Q, 2R, 5 pawns (c4, e7, f7, g6, g7, h7) \u2014 wait, 6 pawns? Let's count:\n\nBlack pawns: c4, e7, f7, g6, g7, h7 \u2014 yes 6, but a2, g2, h3, e5 \u2014 4 white pawns.\n\nBut black has two rooks and queen, white has queen and rook and minor pieces.\n\nBut black has more pawns, but white has more active pieces.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Key Tactical Features**\n\nLet\u2019s look at threats and opportunities.\n\n#### **White\u2019s pieces:**\n- **Nd5**: Central knight, attacking e7 and c7, and potentially f6 or b6.\n- **Bc5**: Bishop on c5, pointing at f8 and g1? But g1 is king. More importantly, it attacks f8 (empty), but also **b6**, **d6**, **e7**, **f8**.\n- **Qe1**: On e1, somewhat passive. But can go to e4, h4, g3, etc.\n- **Rd1**: On d1, supports d5 knight, but d-file is semi-open.\n- **e5 pawn**: Advanced, can push to e6.\n- **King on g1**: Safe for now.\n\n#### **Black\u2019s pieces:**\n- **Qc2**: Very strong \u2014 **pinning the rook on b2**? No \u2014 b2 is black rook. Wait \u2014 **a2 is white pawn**, b2 is black rook, c2 is black queen.\n\nSo **Qc2 is attacking the white pawn on a2**, and also **b2 rook is on b2**, so Qc2 is not pinned.\n\nBut **Qc2 is also attacking the white queen on e1** along the diagonal? c2 to e1 is diagonal: c2-b3-a4? No \u2014 c2 to e1 is not diagonal. c2 is c2, e1 is e1 \u2014 difference: +2 files, -1 rank \u2014 not diagonal.\n\n"
