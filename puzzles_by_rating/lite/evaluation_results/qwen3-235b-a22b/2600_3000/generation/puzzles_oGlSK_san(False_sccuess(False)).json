When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The center is locked.\n2. **White king is active** on d4, close to the action.\n3. **Black king is on e7**, somewhat passive.\n4. **White has a potential passed pawn on c5-d5**, but they are blocked.\n5. **Black has a potential passer on the kingside** with f4, g6, h7 \u2014 but f4 is isolated and might be weak.\n6. **White has a pawn majority on the queenside** (c5, d5 vs a6), but it's blocked.\n7. **d5-d6** could be a key break if it gains space or forces the black king back.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the **legal moves**:\n\n1. **d4e5** \u2013 King moves to e5, attacking f4 and centralizing.\n2. **d4e4** \u2013 King to e4, supporting d5 and pressuring f4.\n3. **d4c4** \u2013 King to c4, supporting c5 and d5, eyeing b5/a6.\n4. **d4c3** \u2013 King to c3, retreating toward d3, less active.\n5. **d5d6+** \u2013 Pushing d5-d6, check, forcing the black king to move.\n6. **c5c6** \u2013 Pushing c5-c6, trying to create a passed pawn.\n7. **h2h3** \u2013 Prevents ...f3, but passive.\n8. **g2g3** \u2013 Might prepare king maneuver or block f4, but allows ...f3?\n9. **h2h4** \u2013 Prevents ...g5, keeps kingside closed.\n10. **g2g4** \u2013 Opens the f-file? But allows ...f3! with tempo?\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each candidate move.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **d5d6+** \u2013 **Forcing move**, check.\n\nAfter **d5d6+**, Black must play **Kxd6** (only legal move, since Ke8 or Kf6 are not possible \u2014 Ke8 is blocked by own pawn on e7? Wait: Black king is on e7, so after d6+, king can go to **e6** or **e8**? Let's check:\n\n- d5-d6+  \n- Black king on e7:  \n  - Can go to e6? Yes, if not blocked. e6 is empty.  \n  - Can go to e8? Yes.  \n  - Can go to d7? d7 is empty? Looking at FEN: 8/4k2p/ \u2192 e7 is k, d7 is empty? Yes.  \n    So possible king moves: d7, e6, e8, f7, f6.\n\nBut d6 is now occupied by pawn, so **Kd6** is **illegal** \u2014 pawn on d6.\n\nSo after **d5d6+**, Black king can go to:\n- d7\n- e6\n- e8\n- f6\n- f7\n\nBut **e6** is attacked by White king on d4? d4-e5-e6 \u2014 no, d4 doesn't attack e6. d4 attacks c4, c5, d5, e5, e4, c3, d3, e3 \u2014 not e6.\n\nSo e6 is safe.\n\nBut let's see: **d5d6+**, then **Kxd6?** \u2014 no, d6 is occupied by pawn, so **Kd6** is invalid.\n\nSo Black cannot capture. So **d5d6+** is a **check**, and king must move.\n\nPossible replies:\n- Ke6\n- Ke8\n- Kd7\n- Kf6\n- Kf7\n\nNow, after **d5d6+**, say **Ke6**, then White can play **Kd4-e4**, attacking f4 and supporting d6.\n\nBut more importantly: **d5d6** creates a **passed pawn** on d6, supported by c5. Black has no pawn on c-file or e-file to challenge it directly.\n\nBut Black can try to blockade.\n\nBut White king can support it.\n\nLet\u2019s see: after **d5d6+ Ke6**, White plays **Ke4!**, threatening to support d6 further.\n\nBut Black can play **f4-f3!**, disrupting White\u2019s king approach?\n\ng2-g3 is not played yet.\n\nAfter **d5d6+ Ke6**, White plays **Ke4**, then Black **f3**, then g2xf3, and Black has ...Kd5 or something.\n\nBut White has a strong d6 pawn.\n\nAlternatively, after **d5d6+**, if Black plays **Kd7**, then **Kd4-d5!** wins the c5 pawn? No, c5 is White\u2019s.\n\nWait: **Kd5** attacks c6, b5, etc.\n\nBut more importantly, **d6** is a strong passed pawn.\n\nBut can Black blockade?\n\nLet\u2019s compare with **c5c6**.\n\n### 2. **c5c6** \u2013 Pushing c5-c6.\n\nAfter **c5c6**, Black can play **b7xc6**, opening the b-file, but Black doesn\u2019t have a rook. It\u2019s a pawn endgame.\n\nAfter **c5c6 bxc6**, White has d5-d6 possible, but now c6 is weak.\n\nBut Black king can go to d6.\n\nBut White king can go to c5.\n\nBut it\u2019s messy.\n\nBut note: after **c5c6**, if Black doesn\u2019t take, say **b7b6**, then White has d5-d6, creating two connected passers.\n\nBut Black can play **Ke7-d6** or something.\n\nBut **c5c6** is slower than **d5d6+**.\n\n**d5d6+** is a **check**, so it forces Black to react immediately.\n\n**c5c6** is not a check, so Black can play **f4-f3!**, disrupting White\u2019s king or creating a counter-threat.\n\nFor example: **c5c6?? f3!**, then gxf3, h5, and Black\u2019s king can come to e6, and White has no clear win.\n\nSo **c5c6** is risky.\n\nWhereas **d5d6+** is a forcing, strong central break.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to **d5d6+**.\n\nTry: **1. d5d6+ Ke6**  \n2. Ke4! \u2014 now White king attacks f4 and supports d6.\n\nBlack must deal with both threats:\n- d6 pawn advancing\n- White king threatening f4\n\nIf **2... f3**, then **gxf3**, and now **Kd5** or **Kf4**, and White\u2019s d6 pawn is very strong.\n\nAfter **gxf3**, Black plays **Kd5**, but then **c5c6!** creates a passed pawn.\n\nOr **Kd4-d5**, attacking c6 and supporting d6.\n\nWhite is clearly better.\n\nIf after **d5d6+**, Black plays **Ke8**, then **Ke4**, and same plan.\n\nIf **Kd7**, then **Ke5!**, threatening f6 or d6-d7.\n\nSo **d5d6+** looks very strong.\n\nNow compare to **d4e5**.\n\n**d4e5** \u2013 king to e5.\n\nThis attacks f4 and centralizes.\n\nBut Black can play **f4-f3!**, attacking the g2 pawn.\n\nThen gxf3, and Black has ...g5 or ...Kd7, and the position is messy.\n\nWhite\u2019s king is on e5, but no immediate breakthrough.\n\nSimilarly, **d4e4** \u2013 king to e4.\n\nThen Black can play **f3!**, again.\n\nSo moves like **d4e4**, **d4e5** allow **f4-f3!**, which is annoying.\n\nBut after **d5d6+**, Black cannot play **f3** immediately because of the check"
