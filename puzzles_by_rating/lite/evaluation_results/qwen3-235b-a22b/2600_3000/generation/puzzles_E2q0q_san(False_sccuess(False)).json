If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n3q1rk1/R5bp/6pn/1Pp1p3/2PpN1b1/1Q1P3P/1P1BN3/6K1 w - - 0 26\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLet\u2019s first **analyze the position** carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Visualize the Position**\n\nUsing the FEN:\n\n- **White pieces**:\n  - King: g1\n  - Rook: a7\n  - Knight: e4, e2\n  - Bishop: d2\n  - Queen: b3\n  - Pawns: b5, c4, d3, b2, h3\n\n- **Black pieces**:\n  - King: g8 (castled kingside)\n  - Queen: d8\n  - Rook: f8\n  - Bishops: g7, g4\n  - Knights: h6, (possibly f6? No \u2014 h6 and g4 are active)\n  - Pawns: c5, pawns on e5, d4, h7, g6, b7? (b7 not visible \u2014 but a7 is white rook, so b7 is likely black pawn)\n\nWait \u2014 FEN: `3q1rk1/R5bp/6pn/1Pp1p3/2PpN1b1/1Q1P3P/1P1BN3/6K1`\n\nLet\u2019s break it down rank by rank (from rank 8 to 1):\n\n- **Rank 8**: `3q1rk1` \u2192 _ _ _ Q _ R K _\n- **Rank 7**: `R5bp` \u2192 R _ _ _ _ _ b p\n- **Rank 6**: `6pn` \u2192 _ _ _ _ _ _ p n\n- **Rank 5**: `1Pp1p3` \u2192 _ P p _ p _ _ _\n- **Rank 4**: `2PpN1g1` \u2192 _ _ P p N _ g _ (g4 is bishop)\n- **Rank 3**: `1Q1P3P` \u2192 _ Q _ P _ _ _ P\n- **Rank 2**: `1P1BN3` \u2192 _ P _ B N _ _ _\n- **Rank 1**: `6K1` \u2192 _ _ _ _ _ _ K _\n\nSo corrected:\n\n- **White**:\n  - King: g1\n  - Queen: b3\n  - Rook: a7\n  - Knights: e4 (N), e2 (N)\n  - Bishop: d2\n  - Pawns: b5, c4, d3, b2, h3\n\n- **Black**:\n  - King: g8\n  - Queen: d8\n  - Rook: f8\n  - Bishops: g7, g4\n  - Knights: h6\n  - Pawns: c5, e5, d4, h7, g6, b7 (implied), and h6 is knight, so g7 is bishop, h7 pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 rank 6: `6pn` \u2192 six empty, then p, n \u2192 so on g6: pawn, h6: knight.\n\nSo **Black has a pawn on g6**, knight on h6.\n\nAlso, **Black bishop on g4**, attacking e2 and potentially d1.\n\nWhite has a **knight on e4**, **bishop on d2**, **knight on e2**, **queen on b3**, **rook on a7**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Tactical and Strategic Assessment**\n\n#### **Key Features**:\n\n1. **White has a rook on a7**, attacking the 7th rank. Black has no rook on a8 \u2014 in fact, a8 is empty. So rook is **pinning or pressuring** the back rank.\n\n   - a7 is attacking along the 7th rank: currently, **only b7 and potentially c7** are in its path. But b7 is likely a black pawn (not visible in FEN, but implied \u2014 since b5 is white pawn, b7 must be black). So rook is **attacking b7**.\n\n2. **White queen on b3**, pointing at d5, and also **eyeing the b-file**. It can support b6 push.\n\n3. **White has a knight on e4**, well-placed, eyeing f6, d6, g5, etc.\n\n4. **Black queen on d8**, rook on f8 \u2014 both on back rank. Black king is on g8, castled.\n\n5. **Black bishop on g4**, pinning White\u2019s knight on e2? Let\u2019s see: from g4 to e2 \u2014 is there a piece in between?\n\n   - g4 \u2192 f3 \u2192 e2. f3 is empty. So **yes, bishop on g4 is pinning the knight on e2 against the king on g1**? Wait \u2014 e2 is knight, and behind it is king on g1 only if aligned.\n\n   - e2 to g1: diagonal? e2\u2013f1\u2013g1? But bishop is on g4, going to e2: g4\u2013f3\u2013e2. That\u2019s a diagonal, but **e2 to g1 is not on same diagonal**. e2 is light square? Let\u2019s check:\n\n     - e2: e-file, 2nd rank \u2192 e2 is light square.\n     - g4: g-file, 4th rank \u2192 g4 is light square.\n     - So yes, same color.\n\n     But the **bishop on g4 attacks e2**, and e2 has a **knight**. Behind the knight is d1 or f1? No king. King is on g1.\n\n     The diagonal from g4 to e2 is g4\u2013f3\u2013e2. Beyond e2 is d1. But d1 is empty. So **no pin** \u2014 the knight on e2 is **not pinned** because the king is not behind it on that diagonal.\n\n     So **bishop on g4 is just attacking the knight on e2**, but not pinning it.\n\n     However, if the knight moves, it might expose something? Not really.\n\n6. **White has a strong knight on e4**, and can consider **Nf6+!** \u2014 let\u2019s check:\n\n   - e4 to f6: is it legal? f6 is occupied?\n\n     - f6: in FEN, rank 6 is `6pn` \u2192 so f6 is empty (6 empty squares, then g6=pawn, h6=knight). So f6 is **empty**.\n\n     So **Nf6+** is possible.\n\n     Let\u2019s analyze **e4f6+**.\n\n     - Knight takes on f6, **check**.\n\n     - Black must respond.\n\n     - After Nxf6+, Black can:\n\n       - **gxf6** \u2014 but then White has **Qxg8+!** \u2014 queen takes rook!\n\n         - b3 to g8: is that possible? b3\u2013c4\u2013d5\u2013e6\u2013f7\u2013g8? That\u2019s a diagonal? b3 is light, g8 is dark \u2014 no, not same color.\n\n         - Queen on b3 is on light square, g8 is dark \u2014 so **cannot go to g8**.\n\n         - So **Qxg8 is not possible**.\n\n         - But **Rook on a7 can go to g7 or h7**?\n\n         - After gxf6, Black king is still on g8, but now pawn on f6, bishop on g7.\n\n         - White has **Bishop on d2**, can it do anything?\n\n         - Or **Rook on a7**: can go to g7? a7\u2013b7\u2013c7\u2013d7\u2013e7\u2013f7\u2013g7: yes, along 7th rank.\n\n         - After gxf6, **Rg7+** is possible: a7g7.\n\n         - Rg7+ Kh8\n\n         - Then Qh3! or something.\n\n         But let\u2019s go back.\n\n     - After **Nxf6+**, Black can also play **Kh8**, avoiding capture.\n\n       - So Nxf6+ Kh8\n\n       - Now White has **Rg7!** \u2014 a7g7\n\n         - Rg7 attacks g7 bishop and threatens mate on h7.\n\n         - Black must respond: can play Bf8 to block, but then Rxf8+ Qxf8, Qh3 threatens Qh7#.\n\n         - Or Bxg7 Qxg7, and Qh3 again threatens Qh7#.\n\n         - Let\u2019s see:\n\n           - Nxf6+ Kh8\n           - Rg7 Bf8 (only move to prevent Qh3-h7#)\n           - Rxf8 Qxf8\n           - Qh3! Qg8 (only)\n           - Qh7# \u2014 mate!\n\n         Wow.\n\n         So:\n\n         1. Nf6+ Kh8\n         2. Rg7 Bf8\n         3. Rxf8 Qxf8\n         4. Qh3 Qg8\n         5. Qh7#\n\n         But wait \u2014 after 4...Qg8, is Qh7 checkmate?\n\n         - Qh7: queen on h7, king on h8, no escape"
