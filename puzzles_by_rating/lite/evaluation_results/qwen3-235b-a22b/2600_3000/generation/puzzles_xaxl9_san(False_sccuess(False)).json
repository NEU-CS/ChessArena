When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black king is on a8 \u2014 **but that means the Black king is blocking the queening square!**\n- White king is on e7, supporting the d6 pawn and potentially helping the a7 pawn.\n- Black has a rook on c6, currently attacking the d6 pawn.\n- White has a pawn on d6, which is **supported by the king on e7**.\n- Black has pawns on f7, h6, g5 \u2014 potential passed pawns, but far from promotion.\n- White has pawns on g3, h3 \u2014 not immediate threats.\n\n### Immediate threats:\n\n- **a7-a8=Q is blocked by the Black king on a8.** So White cannot queen immediately.\n- But if Black moves the king away from a8, White plays a8=Q.\n- So **Black must not move the king unless it captures or forces a draw**.\n\nBut one legal move is **a8b7** \u2014 moving the king from a8 to b7.\n\nThat would allow White to play a8=Q, with a queen and king vs rook and pawns \u2014 likely winning for White.\n\nSo **a8b7 is extremely dangerous** \u2014 only playable if it leads to immediate counterplay or win.\n\nNow, Black\u2019s rook is on c6, attacking d6.\n\nCan Black take on d6?\n\nc6xd6? That move is **c6d6**, which is in the legal moves list.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nAfter **...Rxd6**, White plays **Kxd6**, since the d6 pawn is supported by the king.\n\nSo: ...Rxd6 Kxd6\n\nNow White king is on d6.\n\nThen what?\n\nBlack has pawns on f7, g5, h6 \u2014 not much.\n\nBut now the a7 pawn is still there, and White can play a8=Q if the king moves away.\n\nBut after Kd6, the king is not near a7.\n\nBut Black has no immediate way to stop a8=Q \u2014 unless the rook can interfere.\n\nBut rook is on d6, far from a-file.\n\nSo after ...Rxd6 Kxd6, White plays a8=Q, and wins easily.\n\nSo **c6d6 loses material and allows a8=Q** \u2014 bad.\n\nSimilarly, **c6c7** \u2014 attacking the a7 pawn?\n\nc6c7: rook to c7.\n\nThen White can play a8=Q? No \u2014 king is on a8, so a7 pawn cannot promote because a8 is occupied.\n\nBut after ...Rc7, White can play Kd8 or Kd7, threatening to support a8=Q.\n\nWait \u2014 currently, a8 is occupied by Black king, so a7 pawn cannot promote.\n\nSo the **only way for White to promote the a7 pawn is if the Black king moves away**.\n\nTherefore, **as long as the Black king stays on a8, the a7 pawn is stuck**.\n\nThat\u2019s critical.\n\nSo **Black can afford to keep the king on a8**.\n\nBut if Black moves the king, White queens.\n\nSo **a8b7 is suicidal** \u2014 unless it\u2019s part of a tactic.\n\nNow, what about **c6c8**?\n\nRook to c8.\n\nThen rook is on c8, attacking the 8th rank.\n\nBut White has no pieces there.\n\nBut more importantly, after ...Rc8, White can play Kd7 or Kf7, etc.\n\nBut still, a7 pawn can\u2019t promote.\n\nBut Black might be trying to cut off the White king.\n\nBut White king can go to d7, c7, etc.\n\nBut let\u2019s think: **Black\u2019s best chance is to prevent White from making progress while advancing his own pawns**.\n\nBlack has pawns on g5, h6, f7.\n\nWhite has pawns on g3, h3 \u2014 so Black has a **pawn majority on the kingside**.\n\nBlack can try to create a passed pawn.\n\nPossible moves: g5g4, h6h5, f7f6, f7f5.\n\nBut f7f6 or f7f5 might weaken the pawn structure.\n\nBut let\u2019s see if there\u2019s a tactical shot.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **c6c7**?\n\nRook to c7.\n\nThen:\n\n- Attacks the a7 pawn.\n- But a7 is defended by the king on e7? No \u2014 a7 pawn is on a7, king on e7 \u2014 not directly defended.\n\nIs a7 defended?\n\na7 pawn: only supported by nothing? No \u2014 pawns don\u2019t support backward.\n\na7 pawn is **isolated and not supported by any pawn or piece**.\n\nWhite king is on e7 \u2014 too far.\n\nSo if Black plays ...Rc7, then **White cannot defend a7**.\n\nAfter ...Rc7, if White does nothing, Black takes a7: ...Rc7xa7.\n\nThen Black has an extra pawn.\n\nBut after ...Rc7, White might play Kd7, attacking the rook.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\n1. ... Rc7\n   - Now Black attacks a7.\n   - White must respond.\n\nPossible replies:\n- Kd7: attacks rook on c7.\n  - Then ...Rc7-d7! (Rxd7+)\n  - Kxd7\n  - Now Black has traded rook for king + pawn? No: White lost a7 pawn and king captured rook.\n  - Material: Black gave up rook, gained a7 pawn.\n  - But Black had rook, now gone; White had a7 pawn, now"
