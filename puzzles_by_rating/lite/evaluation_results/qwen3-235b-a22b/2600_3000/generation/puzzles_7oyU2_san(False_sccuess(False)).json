If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

But it's blocked by the black king on d6.\n\nWait \u2014 **d6 is occupied by the black king**, and **c6 has a white pawn**. So the white pawn on c6 is **blocked** by the black king on d6. But if the black king moves, that pawn could promote.\n\nSo the **immediate tactical theme** is: **White threatens to promote the c6 pawn if the black king moves away from d6**.\n\nBut it's **Black to move**, so Black must be careful not to allow c6-c7 or c6-c7=Q.\n\nBut currently, the black king is on d6, **blocking the c6 pawn**. So if Black moves the king, White plays c6-c7, threatening queening.\n\nSo **Black must either**:\n- Keep the king near d6 to prevent c6-c7, or\n- Create a **strong counter-threat** that forces White to respond, or\n- **Capture material** or **checkmate**, if possible.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the **legal moves** provided:\n\n```\nc7c8, c7g7, c7f7, c7e7, c7d7, c7b7, c7a7, c7c6, d6e7, d6e6, d6e5, d5d4, d5d3, h7h6, g5g4, f5f4, h7h5\n```\n\nLet\u2019s go through them **candidate by candidate**, looking for **tactics, threats, checks, captures, and positional ideas**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate threats\n\n**White\u2019s threat**: If Black moves the king from d6, White plays c6-c7, and the pawn promotes. So unless Black can **win immediately**, moving the king from d6 is **very dangerous**.\n\nSo **d6e7, d6e6, d6e5** all move the king away \u2014 allowing c6-c7, and then c7-c8=Q is unstoppable. So unless Black **checkmates** or **wins material** immediately, these are **losing**.\n\nSo we **eliminate**:\n- `d6e7`, `d6e6`, `d6e5` \u2014 all lose to c6-c7.\n\nNow, what about **rook moves**?\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Rook on c7\n\nThe rook on c7 is **attacking the c6 pawn**. If Black plays `c7c6`, capturing the pawn, then:\n\n- `c7c6`: Black takes the pawn on c6.\n- Then White plays `d6xc6` \u2014 king takes back.\n- Now the c-file is open, but Black has traded a rook for a pawn, and the passed pawn is gone.\n- But is that good?\n\nAfter `c7c6 dxc6`, Black has:\n- King on d6, now on c6? No \u2014 king is still on d6, unless it moves.\n\nWait: `c7c6` is rook takes pawn on c6. Then White can play `Kd6xc6` \u2014 king captures rook.\n\nSo:\n- `c7c6` \u2192 `Kxc6`\n- Black loses a rook, White loses a pawn.\n- Material: Black was down a pawn already? Let's count.\n\nBut more importantly: after `c7c6 Kxc6`, Black has no immediate follow-up. White has two rooks, Black has one. White king is on c6, which is strong.\n\nSo **this exchange favors White** \u2014 Black gives up a rook for a pawn, and White\u2019s king invades.\n\nSo `c7c6` is **bad** \u2014 we eliminate it.\n\nNow, other rook moves from c7:\n- `c7c8`: Rook to c8 \u2014 attacks nothing, leaves c6 unpinned.\n- `c7b7`, `c7a7`: sideways \u2014 not threatening much.\n- `c7d7`: to d7 \u2014 supports king, eyes d-file.\n- `c7e7`, `c7f7`, `c7g7`: up the 7th rank.\n\nNote: **g7** is interesting \u2014 `c7g7` puts rook on g7, attacking the h-pawn and potentially pinning or pressuring.\n\nBut more importantly: **is there a check available?**\n\nNo \u2014 none of these moves give check.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at **d5-d3**.\n\n`d5d3`: rook from d5 to d3 \u2014 **captures White\u2019s rook on d3**?\n\nWait \u2014 d3 has a **White rook**. So `d5d3` would be **Rd5xd3** \u2014 **capturing White\u2019s rook**!\n\nIs that legal?\n\nLet\u2019s see: Black rook on d5, White rook on d3. Is the square d3 defended?\n\nWhite has:\n- King on e3 \u2014 attacks d3? No, e3 to d3 is adjacent \u2014 yes! **King on e3 defends d3**.\n\nSo if Black plays `d5d3`, White plays `Kxd3`, king takes rook.\n\nSo it\u2019s **rook for rook** \u2014 but is it good?\n\nAfter `d5d3 Kxd3`, Black has only one rook left (on c7), White has one rook (on c1). But White\u2019s king is now on d3, very active, and the c6 pawn is still there.\n\nBut Black gave up a rook for a rook \u2014 even trade. But **White is better** due to the passed pawn and king activity.\n\nSo **no gain** \u2014 just simplification, which may help White.\n\nBut is there a **tactical refutation**?\n\nWait \u2014 after `d5d3 Kxd3`, what if Black plays `c7c6+`? Then White must play `Kd3d4` or `Kd3e4`, and then c6-c5? But no \u2014 after `c7c6+`, White plays `Kd3d4`, and the pawn on c6 is still there, but now Black has a rook vs rook, but White\u2019s king is exposed?\n\nBut White can play `c6-c7` next, and promote.\n\nSo Black cannot stop promotion.\n\nSo `d5d3` leads to even rook trade, but White still has winning chances due to the c-pawn.\n\nSo not clearly good.\n\nBut let\u2019s look for **checks** or **forcing moves**.\n\nNone of the legal moves are checks.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **discovered check** or **pin**?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **d5-d4**.\n\n`d5d4`: rook from d5 to d4.\n\nWhat does that do?\n\n- Attacks e4? No e4 piece.\n- But note: White king is on e3, and if the rook moves to d4, is there a **pin**?\n\nNo \u2014 nothing behind.\n\nBut more importantly: **after d5d4**, the rook is attacking along the 4th rank.\n\nBut White can play `c6-c7`, since the king is not in check?\n\nNo \u2014 Black moved d5-d4, not king. So White can play `c6-c7`?\n\nBut **c6-c7** is a pawn move \u2014 but is it legal?\n\nc6 pawn to c7 \u2014 but c7 has a **Black rook**! So **c6 cannot go to c7** \u2014 it's blocked by the rook on c7.\n\nAh! **Critical point!**\n\nThe **c6 pawn is blocked by the rook on c7**, not the king.\n\nWait \u2014 earlier I thought the king was blocking, but no:\n\n- c6: white pawn\n- c7: black rook\n- d6: black king\n\nSo the **c6 pawn is blocked by the rook on c7**, not the king.\n\nSo if Black moves the **rook on c7**, then c6-c7 is possible.\n\nIf Black moves the **king**, it's still blocked by the rook.\n\nBut if Black moves the **rook from c7**, then c6-c7 is free.\n\nSo the **rook on c7 is blocking the c6 pawn**"
