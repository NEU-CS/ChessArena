When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Q P . . . .\n3 | p . . . . . . .\n2 | P . . . . P P P\n1 | . . . . . . K .\n    a b c d e f g h\n```\n\nWhite: Kg1, Qd4, pawns on a2, c4, d4 (wait \u2014 d4 has a queen, so pawn must be on d4? Wait \u2014 FEN says `2QP4` on d4 \u2014 that means on d4 we have a queen and a pawn? That can't be.\n\nWait \u2014 let's re-parse the FEN:\n\nFEN: `6k1/3q1pp1/4p2p/8/2QP4/p7/P4PPP/6K1 w - - 0 29`\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- Rank 8: `6k1` \u2192 6 empty, k, 1 empty \u2192 `......k.`\n- Rank 7: `3q1pp1` \u2192 3 empty, q, 1 empty, pp, 1 empty \u2192 `...q..pp.`\n- Rank 6: `4p2p` \u2192 4 empty, p, 2 empty, p \u2192 `....p..p`\n- Rank 5: `8` \u2192 all empty\n- Rank 4: `2QP4` \u2192 2 empty, Q, P, 4 empty \u2192 `..QP....`\n- Rank 3: `p7` \u2192 p, 7 empty \u2192 `p.......`\n- Rank 2: `P4PPP` \u2192 P, 4 empty, PPP \u2192 `P....PPP`\n- Rank 1: `6K1` \u2192 6 empty, K, 1 empty \u2192 `......K.`\n\nSo:\n\n- White Queen on c4\n- White Pawn on d4\n- Black Queen on d7\n- Black King on g8\n- White King on g1\n- Black pawn on a3\n- White pawn on a2\n- Black pawns: a3, e6, f7, g7, h6\n- White pawns: a2, d4, f2, g2, h2\n\nWait \u2014 rank 4: `2QP4` \u2192 so c4 = Q, d4 = P\n\nYes \u2014 so:\n\n- White: Qc4, Pd4, Ka1? No \u2014 rank 1: `6K1` \u2192 so Kg1\n- White pawns: a2, d4, f2, g2, h2\n- Black: Qd7, Ka8? No \u2014 `6k1` \u2192 so Kg8\n\nNow, legal moves provided:\n\n```\nc4c8, c4c7, c4e6, c4c6, c4a6, c4d5, c4c5, c4b5, c4b4, c4a4, c4d3, c4c3, c4b3, c4e2, c4c2, c4f1, c4c1, g1h1, g1f1, d4d5, h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4\n```\n\nSo White has:\n\n- Queen moves from c4\n- King moves: g1-h1, g1-f1\n- Pawn moves: d4d5, h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position.\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate material and threats\n\n- Both sides have queens.\n- Black has a passed pawn on a3, very close to queening.\n- White\u2019s a2-pawn is behind.\n- Black\u2019s king is on g8, relatively safe for now.\n- White\u2019s king is on g1.\n\nBut look: Black\u2019s a3-pawn is on a3, and White\u2019s a2-pawn is on a2. So a3 is one step from queening \u2014 next move a3-a2, then a2-a1=Q.\n\nBut it's White to move. So White must prevent ...a2 and ...a1=Q.\n\nCurrently, after White moves, Black will play ...a2, threatening to queen.\n\nSo White must either:\n\n- Capture the a3-pawn\n- Block the a-pawn\n- Queen first and threaten mate to deflect\n- Or otherwise prevent promotion\n\nBut White has no piece that can reach a3 immediately.\n\nQueen on c4 \u2014 can it go to a4? Yes, c4a4 is in the legal moves.\n\nc4a4 would attack a3? No \u2014 a4 is on the same file as a3, but a4 is empty. If White plays Qa4, then the pawn on a3 is pinned against the king? No \u2014 the king is on g8, not on a-file.\n\nBut Qa4 would control a4, and if Black plays ...a2, then Qa4 can capture on a2? Yes \u2014 a2 is on the a-file.\n\nSo:\n\n- If White plays Qa4, then after ...a2, White plays Qxa2, winning the pawn.\n\nBut is that safe?\n\nAfter Qa4, Black can play ...Qd1+!?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\n- Qd7 \u2014 can it go to d1? d1 is on the same file. Is the file open?\n\nFile d: d7 (Q), d6 empty, d5 empty, d4 (P), d3 empty, d2 (f2 pawn? No \u2014 f2 is on f-file), d2 is empty? Let's see:\n\n- d4: White pawn\n- d3: empty\n- d2: no piece \u2014 White pawns are on f2, g2, h2, a2 \u2014 so d2 is empty\n- d1: empty\n\nSo yes \u2014 from d7, Black queen can go to d1, giving check.\n\nSo if White plays Qc4-a4, Black plays Qd7-d1+!, and White must respond.\n\nWhite king on g1 \u2014 can it go to f2? But d1-d1+ attacks d1, but king is on g1 \u2014 so Qd1+ is check.\n\nKing on g1, queen on d1 \u2014 is that a check? Yes \u2014 queen attacks along the file.\n\nSo Qd1+ is check.\n\nWhite must deal with it.\n\nPossible replies:\n\n- Kg2 \u2014 but then Qxa4, and Black wins a queen for a queen, but now Black has a2 pawn still, and White has no queen.\n\nBut after Qd1+:\n\n- Kg2: Qxa4 \u2014 now Black has queen, White has no queen, and a2 pawn still threatens to promote.\n\nBut White can then play d4-d5? Or something.\n\nBut material: after Qxa4, queens are off, Black has extra pawn on a2, which will queen.\n\nSo White loses.\n\nAlternatively, after Qd1+, White could interpose? Is there a piece?\n\nOnly pawn on d4 \u2014 could play d4-d5? But that doesn't block d1-d1.\n\nTo block d1, need a piece on d2 or d3.\n\nNo White piece can block.\n\nSo only king move: Kg2 or Kh1.\n\n- Kg2: Qxa4 \u2014 Black wins queen, keeps a2 pawn, wins easily.\n- Kh1: Qxa4 \u2014 same.\n\nSo Qa4?? loses the queen to Qd1+.\n\nSo Qa4 is a blunder.\n\nSimilarly, any move that allows ...Qd1+ with tempo may be bad.\n\nBut currently, is ...Qd1+ possible?\n\nFrom d7 to d1 \u2014 is the d-file open?\n\nd7 (Q), d6: empty, d5: empty, d4: White pawn, d3: empty, d2: empty, d1: empty.\n\nSo yes \u2014 d-file is open. So Qd7-d1+ is possible at any time.\n\nBut why hasn\u2019t Black played it yet?\n\nBecause after Qd1+, White plays Kg2, and then what? Black has to decide what to do.\n\nBut if Black plays Qd1+, Kg2, then Black can play ...a2, and the pawn promotes.\n\nBut after Qd1+, Kg2, Black can play ...a2 immediately.\n\nThen White cannot stop a1=Q.\n\nSo why hasn\u2019t Black played ...Qd1+ already?\n\nPossibly because the position might be drawn, or Black missed it.\n\nBut in this position, Black can"
