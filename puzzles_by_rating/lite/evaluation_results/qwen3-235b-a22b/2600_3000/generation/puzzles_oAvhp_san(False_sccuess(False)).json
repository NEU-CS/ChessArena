When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the current position in FEN:\n\n```\nr2qk2r/pbp2pp1/1pn2n1p/1Bbpp3/6P1/PPN1PN1P/1BPP1P2/R2QK1R1 b Qkq - 1 10\n```\n\nWe are playing as **Black** (since it's \"b\" in the FEN, indicating Black to move).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the position\n\nLet\u2019s break down the key features of the position:\n\n- **Black to move**\n- **Castling rights**: Black has queenside and kingside castling (Qkq), White has kingside only (implied by FEN).\n- **Material**: Appears roughly equal. Both sides have all pieces.\n- **Center**: Pawns on e5 (Black) and d5 (Black) vs. e3 (White), d2 (White). Black has a strong central presence with pawns on d5 and e5.\n- **Bishop on Bb5**: White has a light-squared bishop on b5, pinning the c6 knight? Let's check:\n  - Black knight on c6, attacked by Bb5.\n  - Behind it is the queen on d8 \u2014 so **no pin**, because the knight is not shielding the king.\n  - But the bishop on b5 is attacking c6, and the knight is defended by b7-pawn and d5-pawn.\n\n- **Open lines**:\n  - d-file is open (no pawns on d-file).\n  - e-file is half-open (Black has e5-pawn, White has e3).\n  - f-file has pawns on both sides.\n  - g-file closed.\n  - h-file: White has g-pawn on g4, so h-file is open for rook lift.\n\n- **King safety**:\n  - Black king is on e8, potentially vulnerable if center opens.\n  - White king is on e1, also in the center, but with potential to castle (already castled kingside \u2014 look at rooks: Rf1 and Ke1 \u2014 yes, White has castled).\n\nWait: White\u2019s rooks are on a1 and g1, king on e1 \u2014 so White **has castled kingside** (FEN shows \"Qkq\" for Black, and \"-\" for White\u2019s castling? Wait, FEN says: `... b Qkq - ...` \u2014 so White has **no castling rights**, Black has both.\n\nWait \u2014 double-check:  \nFEN: `r2qk2r/pbp2pp1/1pn2n1p/1Bbpp3/6P1/PPN1PN1P/1BPP1P2/R2QK1R1 b Qkq - 1 10`\n\nCastling part: `Qkq` \u2014 Black can castle queenside and kingside.  \n`-` \u2014 White has **no castling rights**.\n\nSo White king on e1 is stuck in the center \u2014 **this is critical**.\n\nWhite king is on e1, hasn\u2019t castled, and likely lost castling rights due to rook or king moves.\n\nThis is a **huge advantage** for Black \u2014 White king is exposed in the center.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Look for tactics\n\nBlack has a strong center (d5, e5), active pieces, and White\u2019s king is in the center.\n\nLet\u2019s look at possible **tactical shots**.\n\n#### Candidate move: **e5-e4!**\n\n- Pushing the e-pawn to e4, attacking the knight on f3.\n- Also opens the diagonal for the Bc8 bishop.\n- More importantly, **increases pressure on the center and the e1 king**.\n\nBut let\u2019s see what happens after **e5-e4**:\n\n- Attacks Nf3.\n- Nf3 must move or be captured.\n- If Nf3xe4, then Nf6xe4 \u2014 knight fork on d2? Not immediately.\n- But more importantly, e4 opens the e-file and the diagonal.\n\nBut is there something sharper?\n\n#### What about **d5-d4!**?\n\n- Hits the knight on c3.\n- c3 knight is pinned? No \u2014 king is on e1, knight on c3, bishop on b2 \u2014 not pinned.\n- But d4 would open the position.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate:\n\n- d5-d4: attacks c3 knight.\n- If c3xd4, then Nxd4 \u2014 knight comes to strong central square.\n- Also opens the c-file for the rook.\n\nBut again, not immediately crushing.\n\n#### What about **Nf6-g4**, attacking e3?\n\n- Ng4 attacks e3 pawn.\n- But e3 is defended by d2 and f2.\n- Also, Ng4 might be met with h3, kicking it.\n\nNot very effective.\n\n#### What about **Bc8-f5**? But not in legal moves \u2014 wait, legal moves list doesn\u2019t include Bc8-f5? Let\u2019s check.\n\nWait \u2014 the legal moves provided are:\n\n```\nh8g8, h8f8, h8h7, e8f8, e8e7, e8d7, d8c8, d8b8, d8e7, d8d7, d8d6, a8c8, a8b8, b7c8, b7a6, f6g8, f6h7, f6d7, f6h5, f6g4, f6e4, c5f8, c5e7, c5d6, c5d4, c5b4, c5e3, c5a3, e8g8, g7g6, a7a6, h6h5, e5e4, d5d4, g7g5, a7a5\n```\n\nWait \u2014 **e8g8** is listed \u2014 that\u2019s kingside castling.\n\nBut also **h8g8**, **h8f8** \u2014 rook moves.\n\nSo **e8g8** is valid \u2014 Black can castle kingside.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nKing moves to g8, rook to f8.\n\nBut White has a bishop on b5, and queen on d1.\n\nNo immediate threat, but perhaps not urgent.\n\nBut let\u2019s look for **forcing moves**.\n\n#### Key idea: **Exploit the exposed White king**\n\nWhite king on e1, Black has:\n\n- Queen on d8\n- Rooks on a8 and h8\n- Bishops on c8 and e7? Wait \u2014 where is the light-squared bishop?\n\nBlack\u2019s pawn on e5 and d5 \u2014 so light-squared bishop (c8) is blocked.\n\nBut after **e5-e4**, it opens.\n\nBut look \u2014 **c5-e7** is a legal move? Wait \u2014 c5 is a Black pawn on c5? Wait \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s reconstruct the position.\n\nFEN: `r2qk2r/pbp2pp1/1pn2n1p/1Bbpp3/6P1/PPN1PN1P/1BPP1P2/R2QK1R1`\n\nLet\u2019s place the pieces:\n\n- **Black**:\n  - King: e8\n  - Queen: d8\n  - Rooks: a8, h8\n  - Bishops: c8, e7? Wait \u2014 f8 is empty, g8 empty, h8 rook \u2014 so c8 bishop is there.\n  - Knights: b8, f6 \u2014 and c6? b8 is knight, c6 is knight.\n  - Pawns: a7, b7, c5, d5, e5, f7, g7, h6\n\nWait \u2014 b7 is pawn, c7 is missing \u2014 b7 is pawn, c7 is not \u2014 so **b7 is pawn**, **c7 is empty** \u2014 so **b7-c8** is a possible move? But b7c8 is in the list \u2014 so **b7-c8** is a pawn move to promote? No \u2014 b7 to c8 is not a pawn move.\n\nWait \u2014 **b7c8** \u2014 that would be a piece moving from b7 to c8.\n\nBut b7 is a **pawn** \u2014 so **b7c8** is a **pawn promotion** \u2014 but only if it reaches 8th rank.\n\nb7 to c8 is diagonal, but not to 8th rank \u2014 c8 is 8th rank, b7 to c8 is one square diagonally \u2014 but pawns move forward, not sideways.\n\nWait \u2014 this is a **mistake**.\n\n**b7c8** cannot be a legal move for a pawn \u2014 unless it's a capture, but c8 is empty? And it would promote.\n\nBut pawns promote only when moving to 8th rank.\n\nb7 to c8 is a diagonal move to 8th rank \u2014 so if there's a piece on c8, it could capture and promote.\n\nBut c8 is occupied? In FEN: first rank: `r2qk2r` \u2014 so a8: rook, b8: ?, c8: bishop? Wait \u2014 `r2qk2r` means:\n\n- a8: r\n- b8: empty\n- c8: empty\n- d8: q\n- e8: k\n- f8: empty\n- g8: empty\n- h8: r\n\nSo"
