Black has two rooks and a bishop; White has two rooks and a bishop. Material is roughly equal.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- White has a **very dangerous passed pawn on f6**, supported by the bishop on g7. This pawn is one step from queening (f7 is the next square, and f8=Q is imminent unless stopped).\n- The white bishop on g7 is **pinning** something? Let's see: it's on g7, pointing at h8 and f8. But Black's king is on g8, so if the bishop captures on f8, it would be RxR, but not a direct pin.\n- However, **Bg7 is eyeing the h8-a1 diagonal**, and if Black doesn't defend f8, White can play Bxf8, removing a rook and accelerating the f-pawn.\n\n- Black\u2019s king is on g8 \u2014 relatively safe for now, but back rank issues could arise.\n\n- Black\u2019s rook on e8 is on the same file as the f6 pawn. The f-file is semi-open.\n\n- The pawn on f6 is **one move away from queening** \u2014 if it weren't for the rook on e8, White could play f7 immediately. But f7 is not yet possible because **e8 is occupied**.\n\nWait: can White play f7?\n\n- f6-f7 would be f7, attacking f8. But if Black has a rook on e8, then f7xf8=Q+ is possible **only if the rook on e8 is not defending f8**.\n\nBut the rook on e8 **does** control f8. So if White plays f7, Black can play ...Rxf8.\n\nSo White cannot safely push f7 because it would lose the pawn for nothing unless the f8 square is undefended.\n\nBut if Black moves the e8 rook, then f7 becomes a threat.\n\nSo **any move of the rook on e8 must be carefully considered**, because it may allow f7.\n\nSimilarly, if Black moves the king, it might allow Bf8 or something.\n\nBut currently, **the e8 rook must stay to guard f8**.\n\nWait: is that true?\n\nLet\u2019s test:\n- If Black plays ...Re8-e7, then White plays f7, threatening f8=Q.\n- Black can play ...Rxf8, but then Bxf8, and White is up a rook for bishop? No: Re8xf8, Bg7xf8 \u2014 so rook takes, bishop recaptures. White is up a pawn and has a dangerous attack.\n\nBut more importantly, after f7, if Black doesn\u2019t take, White queens.\n\nSo after ...Re7, f7, Black **must** play ...Rxf8, Bxf8.\n\nThen White has Bf8, which attacks the back rank, and Black\u2019s king is on g8 \u2014 so Rh8# is threatened.\n\nAfter Bf8, check? No, Bf8 is not giving check. But it threatens Rh8#.\n\nSo Black would have to play ...Kh7 or ...Kg8-h8, but then White can play Rf3-h3-h8# if h8 is not covered.\n\nBut after Bf8, Rh8# is a real threat.\n\nSo if Black moves the e8 rook, White gets a strong initiative.\n\nTherefore, **the rook on e8 must remain on the 8th rank** to prevent f7-f8=Q and also to guard against back-rank threats.\n\nSo **Re8-e7, Re8-e6, etc., are dangerous**.\n\nSimilarly, moving the king might be risky.\n\nNow, what about the bishop on c7?\n\nIt\u2019s on c7, aiming at h2, but not doing much. It can retreat or move to safer squares.\n\nBut more importantly, **Black needs to stop the f6-f7 threat**.\n\nCurrently, f7 is not possible because Re8 guards f8.\n\nBut if Black can **defend f8 with another piece**, then the rook can leave.\n\nAlternatively, **can Black eliminate the f6 pawn or the g7 bishop**?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **Bc7xg3** \u2014 is that possible?\n\n- Bc7xg3: bishop takes g3 pawn.\n\nLet\u2019s see: g3 is defended by h3 pawn? h3 is there, so h3 pawn defends g3.\n\nSo Bxg3 is **capturing on g3**, which is defended by h3.\n\nSo White would recapture hxg3.\n\nSo material: Black gives bishop for pawn \u2014 bad trade.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat about **Bc7-e5**? Or **Bc7-f4**?\n\nPossibly to pressure f3 or d4.\n\nBut not urgent.\n\nNow, **c5xd4** \u2014 is that good?\n\n- c5xd4: takes on d4.\n\nThen c3xd4 \u2014 White recaptures.\n\nThen the d-file opens.\n\nBut White has rook on f3, which can come to d3.\n\nNot clearly good.\n\n**b4xc3** \u2014 takes on c3.\n\nThen b2xc3 \u2014 White recaptures.\n\nOpens the b-file, but not sure.\n\nBut let\u2019s think about **White\u2019s threat**.\n\nWhite\u2019s idea is: **f6-f7**, forcing Rxf8, Bxf8, then Bf8 threatens Rh8#.\n\nSo after Rxf8, Bxf8, White has:\n\n- Bf8, Rf3, Ra1, Kh1\n- Black has king on g8, rook on c8, etc.\n\nAfter Bxf8, White plays **Bf8+?** \u2014 no, Bf8 is not check.\n\nBut **Bf8 threatens Rh8#**.\n\nSo Black must play ...Kh7 or ...Kg8-h8.\n\nSay ...Kh7.\n\nThen White plays Rh3 (Rf3-h3), then Rh8#.\n\nYes: Rf3-h3, then Rh3-h8#.\n\nSo this is a **real threat**.\n\nTherefore, **if the e8 rook moves, White wins**.\n\nSo **Black must keep a defender on f8**.\n\nCurrently, only the e8 rook defends f8.\n\nSo **Re8 cannot leave the 8th rank** unless another piece takes over f8.\n\nSo moves like Re8-e7, Re8-d8, etc., are **losing**.\n\nTherefore, **all moves of the e8 rook are bad**.\n\nSo eliminate:\n- e8f8, e8d8, e8e7, e8e6, e8e5, e8e4, e8e3, e8e2, e8e1 \u2014 all bad.\n\nWhy is e8f8 bad?\n\n- Re8-f8: then White plays f7! Rxf8, Bxf8, and same threat: Bf8, Rh3, Rh8#.\n\nSo still dangerous.\n\nBut now the rook is on f8, same as before.\n\nBut after Re8-f8, White plays f7, Rxf8, Bxf8 \u2014 same as before.\n\nSo still loses.\n\nSo **any move of the e8 rook allows f7 with strong attack**.\n\nTherefore, **do not move the e8 rook**.\n\nNow, what about **c8d8**? Rook from c8 to d8?\n\nThat\u2019s possible. Keeps e8 rook in place.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nIt centralizes the rook, but d8 is not particularly useful.\n\nBut at least it doesn\u2019t allow f7.\n\nSimilarly, c8b8, c8a8 \u2014 moving the a-file rook.\n\nBut not urgent.\n\nNow, **c7d8** \u2014 bishop to d8?\n\nThat would block the rook on c8.\n\nc7d8: bishop moves to d8, which is on the same file as c8 rook \u2014 so it blocks it.\n\nNot good.\n\nc7b8 \u2014 retreats to b8, passive.\n\nc7b6, c7d6 \u2014 possible, but not clear.\n\nc7e5 \u2014 bishop to e5.\n\nNow, e5 is a central square. It attacks f6 pawn.\n\nAh! **Bc7-e5** attacks the f6 pawn directly.\n\nCurrently, f6 is defended only by the bishop on g7.\n\nSo if Black plays Be5, then **threatens to take f6**.\n\nIf White takes the bishop with Bg7xe5, then d5xe5, and the f6 pawn is gone.\n\nSo White loses the"
