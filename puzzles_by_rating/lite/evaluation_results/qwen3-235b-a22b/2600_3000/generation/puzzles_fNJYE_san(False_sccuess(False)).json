        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/5kp1/2R5/7P/8/8/r1pK4/8 w - - 15 52\n```\n\nThis means:\n- White to move\n- White has a rook on c6, pawn on h5, king on d2\n- Black has a rook on a2, pawn on c2, king on f7, and pawn on g7\n- No castling rights, no en passant\n- Move count: 52, halfmove clock: 15\n\nLet\u2019s visualize the position:\n\n```\n8 | . . . . . . . .\n7 | . . . . . k p .\n6 | . . R . . . . P\n5 | . . . . . . . .\n4 | . . . . . . . .\n3 | . . . . . . . .\n2 | r . p K . . . .\n1 | . . . . . . . .\n    a b c d e f g h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 actually, double-checking the FEN:\n\n- 8th rank: empty\n- 7th: 5kp1 \u2192 five empty, then k, p, one empty \u2192 so f7: black king, g7: black pawn\n- 6th: 2R5 \u2192 two empty, R (on c6), five empty\n- 5th: 7P \u2192 seven empty, then h5: white pawn\n- 4th: empty\n- 3rd: empty\n- 2nd: r1pK4 \u2192 a2: black rook, c2: black pawn, d2: white king\n- 1st: empty\n\nSo corrected board:\n\n```\n8 | . . . . . . . .\n7 | . . . . . k p .\n6 | . . R . . . . P\n5 | . . . . . . . .\n4 | . . . . . . . .\n3 | . . . . . . . .\n2 | r . p K . . . .\n1 | . . . . . . . .\n    a b c d e f g h\n```\n\nWhite: King d2, Rook c6, Pawn h5  \nBlack: King f7, Rook a2, Pawn c2, Pawn g7\n\nWhite to move.\n\n### Goal:\nWhite is clearly in a strong position. Black\u2019s pawn on c2 is about to promote, but it's Black's pawn \u2014 so that's a **danger**. c2 is one square from c1, so if Black gets to move next, c2-c1=Q would be devastating unless prevented.\n\nBut it's **White's move**, so White can act first.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate threats:\n\n### Immediate Threat:\n- Black\u2019s pawn on c2 is **one move away from queening**. If it were Black\u2019s turn, ...c2-c1=Q would happen.\n- But it's **White\u2019s turn**, so White can **prevent promotion** this move.\n\nHow?\n\nWhite must **stop c2-c1=Q**.\n\nCurrently, the c2 pawn is on c2, and it can promote on c1. Who controls c1?\n\n- White king is on d2 \u2014 it's **adjacent** to c1 (d2 is one diagonal away).\n- So if the white king were to move to d1, c1, or e1, it could potentially control c1.\n\nBut currently, **no white piece attacks c1**. The rook on c6 is on c6 \u2014 it controls the c-file, so it **attacks c1** \u2014 **yes!**\n\nWait: the white rook is on c6. The c-file is open. So **c6 attacks c1** \u2014 but only if nothing is in the way.\n\nIs anything blocking? The black rook is on a2 \u2014 not on the c-file. The black pawn is on c2 \u2014 that\u2019s on c2.\n\nSo the rook on c6 attacks c2 and c1? Let's see:\n\n- c6 \u2192 c5 \u2192 c4 \u2192 c3 \u2192 c2 \u2192 c1: all empty except c2 has a black pawn.\n\nSo the rook **attacks c2**, but **not c1**, because the pawn on c2 is in the way.\n\nSo **c1 is not attacked** by the rook.\n\nWhite king on d2: can it reach c1? It can go to c1 in one move: d2-c1.\n\nBut if the king goes to c1, then after ...c2xb1=Q or ...c2-c1=Q, the queen can be captured? Wait \u2014 c2-c1=Q would be a promotion, and if the king is on c1, the pawn can\u2019t promote there \u2014 the square is occupied.\n\nSo if White plays **Kc1**, then c2-c1 is blocked \u2014 **promotion prevented**.\n\nBut is Kc1 safe?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\n- After **1. Kc1**, Black plays **...c2-c1=Q+**, promoting with check \u2014 because the queen is on c1, and the white king is also on c1? No \u2014 can\u2019t be.\n\nWait: if White plays **Kc1**, then c1 is occupied. So Black **cannot** play c2-c1=Q \u2014 the square is blocked.\n\nSo **Kc1 stops the promotion**.\n\nBut what about **...c2-b1=Q**? No \u2014 pawns promote only on the last rank, and they move forward. c2 to c1 is promotion. Diagonally? Only if capturing.\n\nIs there a piece on b1 or d1 for Black to capture?\n\n- b1: empty\n- d1: empty\n- a2 has a rook, but it's not near.\n\nSo the c2 pawn can **only** promote by moving to c1 \u2014 it cannot capture anything, because b1 and d1 are empty.\n\nSo **c2-c1=Q** is the only promotion possibility.\n\nTherefore, if White plays **Kc1**, the pawn cannot move \u2014 it's blocked.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is that true?\n\nYes: the pawn on c2 wants to go to c1. If c1 is occupied, it cannot move. So **Kc1** blocks the pawn.\n\nSo **Kc1** is a candidate.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nAfter **1. Kc1**, Black can play **...Rb2**, attacking the king? Rook on a2 can go to b2? a2 to b2 \u2014 yes, horizontally.\n\nSo **1...Rb2**, attacking c2? No \u2014 b2 attacks the second rank.\n\nWhite king is on c1, so **Rb2** would attack b2, but not c1 \u2014 unless it's along the rank.\n\na2 to b2: rook moves to b2.\n\nFrom b2, it attacks b1, b3, etc., and along the 2nd rank: a2, b2, c2, d2, etc.\n\nSo **Rb2 attacks c2**, but **not c1** \u2014 c1 is on the first rank.\n\nSo king on c1 is **not in check** from rook on b2.\n\nBut what about **...Rc2**? Yes \u2014 from a2, Black can play **...Rc2**, attacking the white king on c1 \u2014 because rook on c2 attacks c1.\n\nAh! That\u2019s critical.\n\nSo:\n\n- 1. Kc1??\n- 1... Rc2+!\n- Now the white king is in check from the rook on c2.\n\nKing must move: only moves are b1, d1, or c2 (but c2 is attacked).\n\nSo Kb1 or Kd1.\n\nSay Kb1 \u2014 then Black can play ...c2-c1=Q+ or ...c2xb1=Q+.\n\nAfter Kb1, ...c2xb1=Q+ is possible \u2014 capturing the king\u2019s square.\n\nSo:\n\n- 1. Kc1 Rc2+!\n- 2. Kb1 cxb1=Q+ wins the queen with check, and Black is winning.\n\nSo **Kc1?? loses immediately**.\n\nTherefore, **Kc1 is a blunder**.\n\nSo we **cannot** play Kc1.\n\nAlternative: **Kd1** or **Kd3** or **Kc3**?\n\nBut none of these block c1 directly.\n\nOnly **Kc1** blocks c1, but it\u2019s suicidal.\n\nSo how to stop promotion?\n\nOnly way: **capture the pawn or block it**.\n\nBut nothing can capture on c2 except the king or rook.\n\nCan the rook take on c2?\n\nRook is on c6. Can it go to c2?\n\nYes \u2014 **c6-c2** is a legal move.\n\nLet\u2019s check: c6 to c2 \u2014 along the c-file. c5, c4, c3 are empty. c2 has a black pawn. So rook can **capture** on c2.\n\nSo **Rc6xc2** is possible.\n\nAfter **Rxc2**, the pawn is gone \u2014 no promotion.\n\nThen Black plays ...Rxa2? Or ...Rc2?\n\nWait: after **1. Rxc2**, Black has rook on a2.\n\nBlack can play **...Rxc2**, capturing the rook.\n\nSo:\n\n- 1. Rxc2 Rxc2\n\nNow material is equal: rook for rook.\n\nBut then White has king and pawn vs Black king and pawn.\n\nWhite has h5 pawn, Black has"

        "content": "We are given the following:\n\n**FEN:** `8/5kp1/8/7P/8/8/2rK4/8 w - - 0 53`  \nThis means:\n- White to move\n- White king on d2\n- Black king on g7\n- Black rook on c2\n- White pawn on h5\n- No castling rights\n- No en passant\n- Move count: 53 (White's 53rd move)\n\n**Partial move history:** `c6c2, a2c2`  \nThis suggests that Black played `c6c2` (rook or queen from c6 to c2), and then White played `a2c2` (capturing on c2, likely a rook). But currently, the only rook on the board is **Black's rook on c2**, so this history seems inconsistent unless White recaptured later. But the current board shows only one rook \u2014 Black's on c2.\n\nWait \u2014 the current FEN has **Black rook on c2**, and White king on d2. So if White previously played `a2c2`, that would have captured a Black piece on c2, but now the rook is back on c2? That suggests either:\n- The move history is incomplete or incorrect, or\n- The rook was recaptured or repositioned.\n\nBut we must **trust the current FEN**.\n\nSo current position:\n```\n8\n5kp1\n8\n7P\n8\n8\n2rK4\n8\n```\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the board:\n\n```\n8 | . . . . . . . .\n7 | . . . . . k p\n6 | . . . . . . .\n5 | . . . . . . . h\n4 | . . . . . . . .\n3 | . . . . . . . .\n2 | . . . K . . . .\n1 | . . . . . . . .\n    a b c d e f g h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 FEN is rank 8 to rank 1.\n\nSo:\n- Rank 8: `8` \u2192 empty\n- Rank 7: `5kp1` \u2192 5 empty, then k, p, 1 empty \u2192 so on f7: black king, g7: black pawn\n- Rank 6: `8` \u2192 empty\n- Rank 5: `7P` \u2192 7 empty, then P on h5\n- Rank 4: empty\n- Rank 3: empty\n- Rank 2: `2rK4` \u2192 2 empty, c2: rook (Black), d2: king (White), then 4 empty\n- Rank 1: empty\n\nSo:\n- **White**: King on d2, pawn on h5\n- **Black**: King on f7, pawn on g7, rook on c2\n\nIt's **White to move**.\n\n**Legal moves provided:**\n- `d2e3`\n- `d2d3`\n- `d2c2`\n- `d2e1`\n- `d2d1`\n\nSo the White king can move to:\n- e3 (d2\u2192e3)\n- d3 (up)\n- c2 (left two, but c2 has Black rook!)\n- e1 (diagonally down-right)\n- d1 (down)\n\nWait \u2014 **d2c2**: c2 has **Black rook**. So is this a capture?\n\nYes \u2014 **d2c2** is a **capture** of the Black rook.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate the position\n\nMaterial:\n- White: King + pawn\n- Black: King + rook + pawn\n\nBut if White plays `d2c2`, White captures the rook.\n\nAfter `d2c2`, material becomes:\n- White: King + pawn\n- Black: King + pawn\n\nSo White gains a rook for free \u2014 **if it's safe**.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nAfter `d2c2`, Black\u2019s king is on f7, rook is captured, so Black plays next.\n\nCan Black **recapture**?\n\nAfter `Kxc2`, Black plays ... but Black has no piece attacking c2 except possibly the king \u2014 but the Black king is on f7, far away.\n\nSo **no immediate recapture**.\n\nBut is the rook **protected**?\n\nCurrently, the Black rook is on c2, attacked by White king on d2.\n\nIs the rook defended by Black?\n\nBlack\u2019s pieces:\n- King on f7\n- Pawn on g7\n- Rook on c2\n\nCan the Black king defend c2? Distance from f7 to c2 is 5 files and 5 ranks \u2014 too far. It would take many moves.\n\nSo **the rook is undefended**.\n\nTherefore, **capturing it is safe**.\n\nSo `d2c2` wins a full rook.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is that possible? Why would Black leave a rook hanging?\n\nPossibly a blunder, but we must play the best move regardless.\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check: is there any **check** or **pin** we\u2019re missing?\n\nNo \u2014 the rook on c2 is not giving check. The White king is on d2, rook on c2 \u2014 not aligned to give check.\n\nSo yes, **the rook is simply en prise**.\n\nTherefore, **capturing it is winning**.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the other options:\n\n- `d2e3`: king moves to e3 \u2014 does nothing, rook still on c2\n- `d2d3`: same\n- `d2e1`: king moves to e1\n- `d2d1`: king to d1\n\nAll of these **allow Black to move the rook** or reposition.\n\nFor example, after `d2e3`, Black can play `c2c3+`, checking the king and threatening something.\n\nOr `c2h2`, attacking the h-pawn.\n\nBut if we **capture now**, we win the rook.\n\nSo **d2c2** is clearly best.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **stalemate** or **draw risk**?\n\nAfter `d2c2`, position is:\n- White: Kc2, h5\n- Black: Kf7, g7\n\nWhite has a pawn on h5, which can potentially promote.\n\nBut without the rook, Black cannot create counterplay easily.\n\nBut winning with king and pawn vs king is possible if the pawn can advance.\n\nBut currently, the h5 pawn is far from promotion, and Black king is central.\n\nBut **winning a rook** is a huge material gain \u2014 from even (or slightly worse) to **winning**.\n\nCurrently, without capturing, White is **losing** \u2014 Black has rook vs nothing.\n\nBut after capturing, White is **up a rook**.\n\nSo **d2c2** is **winning**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is `d2c2` even legal?\n\nThe legal moves list **includes** `d2c2`, so yes \u2014 the engine or interface says it\u2019s legal.\n\nAnd since the rook is undefended, it\u2019s a free piece.\n\nTherefore, **best move is d2c2**.\n\nBut let\u2019s confirm: is there any **check** after the capture?\n\nNo \u2014 Black has no checks.\n\nBlack\u2019s king on f7, no pieces left to give check.\n\nSo after `Kxc2`, Black must move king or pawn.\n\nNo immediate threat.\n\nSo White is simply **up a rook**.\n\nThus, **d2c2** is the best move.\n\nBut wait \u2014 could there be a **trap**?\n\nSuppose White plays `d2c2`, Black plays `g7g6`?\n\nThen h5 vs g6 \u2014 still, White can push h6, etc.\n\nBut White has extra rook \u2014 so even if pawn is blocked, White can win by promoting the pawn with help of king and rook.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after `d2c2`, White **has no rook** \u2014 White **captured the Black rook**, so now White has **only king and pawn**, same as Black.\n\nWait \u2014 no: **White captures the Black rook**, so **Black loses the rook**.\n\nSo after `d2c2`, the rook is **removed**.\n\nSo material is:\n- White: K + h-pawn\n- Black: K + g-pawn\n\nSo it's **king and pawn vs king and pawn**.\n\nBut White is **not** up material \u2014 **we started with equal material?**\n\nWait \u2014 let's reevaluate material:\n\nBefore capture:\n- White: king, pawn\n- Black: king, pawn, rook\n\nSo Black is **winning** \u2014 up a rook.\n\nBut the rook is **on c2**, and White king on d2 can **capture it**.\n\nSo if White does **not** capture, Black remains up a rook.\n\nBut if White **does** capture, then material becomes equal: K+P vs K+P.\n\nSo **capturing the rook draws the game** \u2014 from losing to drawing.\n\nBut is it winning? No \u2014 but it\u2019s **much better** than not capturing.\n\nOther moves allow Black to **keep the rook** and win.\n\nSo **d2c2** is **necessary** to avoid losing.\n\nBut is the rook really **undefended**?\n\nYes \u2014 Black king is on f7, too far.\n\nNo other pieces.\n\nSo **d2c2**"

That suggests that the king has moved to c2 via one of these.\n\nBut kings can't jump. So likely, the king moved from, say, d1 to c2 or b2 to c2, but not from d2 to c2 unless it's a legal king move.\n\nWait \u2014 **d2c2** is a legal king move (one square left). But the FEN says the king is on c2, and the last move was f7g8 (black's move), so White is to move now.\n\nBut the move **d2c2** appears in the history \u2014 that would be a king move from d2 to c2.\n\nBut now, the only white piece on the board is:\n- King on c2\n- Pawn on h5\n\nAnd black has:\n- King on g8\n- Pawn on g7\n\nSo where did all the other pieces go?\n\nThe move **c6c2** \u2014 if that was a rook or queen, it would have been captured, but now only the king is on c2.\n\nWait \u2014 unless **c6c2**, **a2c2**, **d2c2** are not all king moves \u2014 but only one piece can be on c2.\n\nThis suggests that **c2** is the location of the white king, and the previous moves involved pieces being captured or moving there and being captured.\n\nBut the FEN shows only:\n- White: Kc2, Ph5\n- Black: Kg8, Pg7\n\nSo all other pieces have been captured.\n\nNow, the **legal moves** are:\n\n- c2d3, c2c3, c2b3, c2d2, c2b2, c2d1, c2c1, c2b1 \u2014 all king moves from c2\n- h5h6 \u2014 pawn push\n\nSo White has only two pieces: king on c2 and pawn on h5.\n\nBlack has king on g8 and pawn on g7.\n\nCurrent position:\n\n```\n8\n6k1    \u2192 Kg8\n6p1    \u2192 Pg7\n8\n8\n8\n8\n7P    \u2192 Ph5\n2K5    \u2192 Kc2\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Position\n\nWhite: Kc2, Ph5  \nBlack: Kg8, Pg7\n\nGoal: White wants to promote the h-pawn.  \nBlack wants to stop it or promote their own g-pawn.\n\nBut Black's g-pawn is on g7 \u2014 one step from queening (g7-g8).  \nWhite's h-pawn is on h5 \u2014 needs h5-h6-h7-h8 to promote.\n\nSo Black is closer to promotion.\n\nBut it's White's move.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the race:\n\n- If White plays h5-h6, then:\n  - Black can play g7-g6? No \u2014 g7-g8=Q is possible immediately? Wait \u2014 g7 to g8 is one square forward \u2014 yes, Black can promote **next move** if not stopped.\n\nWait \u2014 Black just played f7g8 \u2014 that\u2019s the last move.\n\nf7g8 \u2014 what could that be?\n\nf7 to g8 \u2014 that\u2019s a diagonal move. Only possible for:\n- King (Kf7xg8)\n- Pawn (Pf7xg8=Q or =anything)\n\nBut Black\u2019s king is on g8 now.\n\nSo likely, Black just played **Pf7xg8=Q** or **Kf7xg8**, but the FEN shows only Kg8 and Pg7.\n\nWait \u2014 contradiction.\n\nFEN: `6k1/6p1/...` \u2014 so on g7 is a pawn, and g8 is king.\n\nSo Black king is on g8, and pawn is on g7.\n\nSo the move **f7g8** must be the **black king moving from f7 to g8**.\n\nSo Kf7-g8.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo Black king was on f7, now on g8.\n\nSo no promotion yet.\n\nNow, Black\u2019s pawn is on g7 \u2014 can promote next move if not stopped: g7-g8=Q.\n\nWhite\u2019s pawn is on h5 \u2014 needs two moves to promote: h5-h6-h7-h8.\n\nBut White moves first.\n\nSo timing is critical.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Can White stop Black from promoting?\n\nBlack\u2019s threat: **...g7-g8=Q** next move.\n\nSo White **must** prevent that, or else Black will have a queen and likely win.\n\nHow can White prevent ...g7-g8?\n\nOnly by **checking the black king** or **capturing the pawn**, but White has no pieces near.\n\nWhite\u2019s king is on c2 \u2014 very far.\n\nOnly way to stop ...g7-g8 is to **promote first** or **deliver a check** that forces Black to deal with it.\n\nBut White cannot promote before Black unless White can force a faster promotion.\n\nBut h5-h6-h7-h8 = 3 moves  \ng7-g8 = 1 move\n\nSo Black promotes first unless White can **interfere**.\n\nBut White has no checks.\n\nWait \u2014 unless White plays h5-h6, and after ...g7-g8=Q, White promotes with h6-h7-h8=Q.\n\nBut let\u2019s see the move order:\n\n1. White plays h5-h6  \n   Black plays g7-g8=Q  \n   Now Black has a queen.\n\nThen White plays h6-h7  \n   Black can start checking or attacking.\n\nBut White\u2019s king is on c2 \u2014 very exposed.\n\nBlack\u2019s new queen on g8 can go to g2+ or h7 or c4, etc.\n\nAfter h6-h7, Black can play Qg8-g2+, forking king and h7 pawn.\n\nThen White must move king, and Black takes h7.\n\nSo White loses the pawn.\n\nAlternatively, after h5-h6, if Black promotes, White can play h6-h7 immediately?\n\nNo \u2014 after h5-h6, it's Black's turn.\n\nSo:\n\n1. h5-h6   g7-g8=Q  \n2. h6-h7   Qg8-g2+  \n3. Kc2-b3 (or d3) Qg2xh7\n\nWhite loses the pawn.\n\nSo promoting won\u2019t work unless White can **prevent** the promotion.\n\nBut how?\n\nOnly way is if White can **check** on g8 or control g8.\n\nBut no piece can do that.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the **white king** can somehow get to the kingside in time?\n\nBut it's on c2 \u2014 6 files away.\n\nFrom c2 to g6 is many moves: c2-d3-e4-f5-g6 \u2014 at least 5 moves.\n\nBlack can promote in 1 move, then use the queen to stop the h-pawn.\n\nSo the **only chance** for White is to **stalemate** or **force a draw**.\n\nBecause if Black promotes, they win easily.\n\nSo White must **avoid** allowing ...g7-g8 unless it leads to stalemate.\n\nWait \u2014 is **stalemate** possible?\n\nLet\u2019s consider:\n\nIf White plays **h5-h6**, and Black plays **g7-g8=Q**, then White has no legal moves?\n\nNo \u2014 White can still move the king.\n\nBut what if the position is such that after promotion, White has no legal moves?\n\nUnlikely.\n\nAlternatively, suppose White does **not** play h5-h6.\n\nThen Black plays ...g"

Black pawn on g6.\n\nWhite to move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Position\n\nWhite has a **passed pawn on h6**, one square away from queening (h7). But it's currently blocked by nothing \u2014 it can advance to h7.\n\nHowever, if White plays h6-h7, then Black can play ...g6-g5, and the pawn is still blocked. But more importantly, after h7, the pawn is on h7, and Black king can potentially capture it if it doesn't promote.\n\nWait \u2014 **h6h7** is a legal move. But h7 is not promotion yet. Promotion happens when a pawn reaches the 8th rank.\n\nSo h6-h7 advances the pawn to h7. Then on the next move, it can go h7-h8=Q.\n\nBut Black might prevent that.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze key ideas.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Candidate Moves\n\nWe have two types of moves:\n\n1. **King moves** from c2: all the c2-xx moves.\n2. **Pawn move**: h6h7.\n\nThe White king is far away from the action (on c2), while the critical area is the kingside: the race between White promoting on h8 and Black defending.\n\nCurrently, the **White king is too far** to help the h-pawn directly. But maybe it doesn't need to \u2014 if the pawn can promote without help.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze **h6h7** first.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Analyze h6h7\n\nMove: **h6h7**\n\nPosition after h6h7:\n\n- Pawn on h7\n- Black to move\n- Black king on g8\n\nNow, Black can play:\n\n- **g6-g5**, stopping the pawn from advancing to h8.\n- Or **Kg8-h7**, capturing the pawn immediately?\n\nCan Black king capture on h7?\n\nAfter h6h7, is h7 attacked by Black king?\n\nBlack king on g8 \u2014 it can move to h7? Yes, because h7 is adjacent.\n\nSo after **1. h6h7??**, Black plays **1... Kxh7!**, and the pawn is gone.\n\nThen we have:\n\n- White king on c2\n- Black king on h7\n- Black pawn on g6\n\nWhite has no pawns, Black has a pawn on g6 \u2014 but it's blocked and far from promotion. However, Black can eventually push ...g5, ...g4, etc., but White king is far.\n\nBut more importantly: **after 1. h6h7? Kxh7**, White cannot stop Black from advancing the g-pawn eventually, and White has no counterplay.\n\nBut worse: **White loses the pawn for free**.\n\nSo **h6h7 is a blunder** because it allows **Kxh7**.\n\nTherefore, **h6h7 is losing**.\n\nWe cannot play h6h7 unless the square h7 is defended.\n\nBut currently, no piece defends h7. The White king is on c2 \u2014 too far.\n\nSo **h6h7 is illegal?** No, it's legal, but **tactically losing**.\n\nSo we must **reject h6h7**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a way to **support the pawn advance**?\n\nOnly if we can **pin the Black king** or **prevent it from capturing**.\n\nBut we can\u2019t.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we **bring the king closer**, but it's very far.\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check: is there any way to **force promotion**?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the idea is to **stalemate** or **draw** if we can\u2019t win.\n\nBut White has a chance to win: if the h-pawn promotes, White wins.\n\nBut only if Black cannot capture it.\n\nSo we need to **prevent Black king from taking on h7**.\n\nHow?\n\nOnly if we **check the king** when we play h7, but we have no checks.\n\nOr if the king is not on g8.\n\nBut it is.\n\nAlternatively, can we **zugzwang** Black?\n\nBut Black can just shuffle the king between g8 and h8.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s think deeper.\n\nSuppose White does nothing, and keeps shuffling king. But Black can play ...g5 at some point, freeing the g6 pawn.\n\nBut White wants to promote.\n\nThe **only way** to promote the h-pawn is:\n\n1. Play h6-h7 **only when Black king cannot capture on h7**.\n2. That means Black king must be away from h7.\n\nBut currently, it controls h7.\n\nSo we need to **force the Black king away**.\n\nBut how?\n\nWe have no checks.\n\nAlternatively, can we **sacrifice the pawn** to promote the g-pawn?\n\nNo, we don\u2019t have a g-pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 Black has a g6 pawn, White has h6 pawn.\n\nAnother idea: **can White king march to the kingside**?\n\nBut it's very far: from c2 to h7 is many moves.\n\nMeanwhile, Black can just shuffle king or push g5.\n\nBut let\u2019s calculate a **race**:\n\nSuppose White plays:\n\n1. Kc2-d3, then Kd3-e4, Ke4-f4, Kf4-g5, Kg5-h6, etc.\n\nBut Black can just play ...Kg8-h7, and wait.\n\nOr, more dangerously, Black can play ...g6-g5 to create a passed pawn.\n\nBut Black\u2019s g6 pawn is blocked by nothing \u2014 if White doesn\u2019t prevent it, Black can play ...g5, then ...g4, etc., and promote.\n\nBut White\u2019s king is far.\n\nSo both sides have passed pawns?\n\nNo:\n\n- White: h6 pawn \u2014 passed, but blocked by Black king potentially.\n- Black: g6 pawn \u2014 not passed, because White has no pawns in front, but it can advance.\n\nActually, Black\u2019s g6 pawn is **passed** \u2014 no White pawns on g or h files.\n\nSo both sides have **outside passed pawns**.\n\nBut White\u2019s is closer to promotion.\n\nBut again, **h6h7?? Kxh7** loses the pawn.\n\nSo we need to **prevent Black from capturing on h7**.\n\nOnly way is to **control h7** with another piece \u2014 but we only have a king.\n\nSo the **White king must come to support the pawn**.\n\nBut it's far.\n\nAlternatively, is there a **stalemate idea**?\n\nSuppose the pawn promotes, but Black has no legal moves.\n\nBut unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, can we **force a draw** if we can\u2019t win?\n\nBut let\u2019s see: if White plays **h6h7??**, Black plays **Kxh7**, then:\n\n- White king on c2\n- Black king on h7\n- Black pawn on g6\n\nNow White king marches to kingside: Kc2-d3-e4-f4-g5-h6, etc.\n\nBut Black can play ...g6-g5, then ...g5-g4, and promote first?\n\nLet\u2019s calculate:\n\nAfter:\n1. h6h7 Kxh7\n\nNow:\n- Kc2 vs K on h7, pawn on g6\n\n2. Kd3 Kg7\n3. Ke4 Kf6\n4. Kf4 g5+ (if ...g5+)\n5. Kxg5? Ke5 \u2014 then Black king invades, and White king is too far from g-pawn"
