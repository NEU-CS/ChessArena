When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\nr7/5Q2/p2Pp2p/1p6/5nkP/2PqR3/PP3P2/6K1 b - - 2 36\n```\n\nWe are playing as **Black** (since it's \"b\" in the FEN, indicating Black to move).\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Material and Positional Overview**\n\n**Black\u2019s pieces:**\n- King on g4\n- Knight on f4\n- Queen on d3\n- Pawns on a6, b5, e6, f7 (wait \u2014 no, pawns on a6, b5, e6, h6)\n\nWait, let\u2019s reconstruct the board from the FEN:\n\n```\n8: r . . . . . . .\n7: . . . . . Q . .\n6: p . . P p . . h\n5: . p . . . . . .\n4: . . . . . n k P\n3: . . P q R . . .\n2: P P . . . P . .\n1: . . . . . . . K\n    a b c d e f g h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s not quite right.\n\nLet\u2019s decode the FEN properly:\n\nFEN: `r7/5Q2/p2Pp2p/1p6/5nkP/2PqR3/PP3P2/6K1 b - - 2 36`\n\nBreak it down by rank (from 8 to 1):\n\n- **8**: r7 \u2192 Rook on a8, 7 empty \u2192 `a8=R`, rest empty\n- **7**: 5Q2 \u2192 5 empty, Q on f7, 2 empty \u2192 `f7=Q`\n- **6**: a2Pp2p \u2192 a6=a, 2 empty, d6=P, e6=p, 2 empty, h6=h \u2192 `a6=a`, d6=P (white pawn), e6=e, h6=h`\nWait \u2014 no: \"a2Pp2p\" is not correct.\n\nWait, the 6th rank is: `a2Pp2p`? No \u2014 the FEN says: `p2Pp2p` \u2192 so:\n\n- **6**: p on a6, 2 empty, P on d6 (white pawn), p on e6, 2 empty, p on h6 \u2192 a6=p, d6=P (white), e6=p, h6=p\n- **5**: 1p6 \u2192 1 empty, b5=p, 6 empty \u2192 b5=p\n- **4**: 5nkP \u2192 5 empty, f4=n, g4=k, h4=P (white) \u2192 f4=N, g4=K, h4=P\n- **3**: 2PqR3 \u2192 2 empty, c3=P (white), d3=q, e3=R (white), 3 empty \u2192 c3=P, d3=Q, e3=R\n- **2**: PP3P2 \u2192 a2=P, b2=P, 3 empty, f2=P, 2 empty \u2192 a2=P, b2=P, f2=P\n- **1**: 6K1 \u2192 6 empty, g1=K, 1 empty \u2192 g1=K\n\nSo the board is:\n\n```\n   a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n8: r  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   (Black rook on a8)\n7: .  .  .  .  .  Q  .  .   (White queen on f7)\n6: p  .  .  P  p  .  .  p   (Black pawns a6, e6, h6; White pawn d6)\n5: .  p  .  .  .  .  .  .   (Black pawn b5)\n4: .  .  .  .  .  n  k  P   (Black knight f4, king g4; White pawn h4)\n3: .  .  P  q  R  .  .  .   (White pawn c3, Black queen d3, White rook e3)\n2: P  P  .  .  .  P  .  .   (White pawns a2, b2, f2)\n1: .  .  .  .  .  .  K  .   (White king g1)\n```\n\nSo current position:\n\n- **Black to move**\n- Black king on g4 \u2014 very exposed, on the 4th rank, near center\n- Black knight on f4 \u2014 attacking e2, g2, h3, d5, g6, h5, e6, d3?\nWait: knight on f4:\n- f4 \u2192 can go to: g6, h5, h3, g2, e2, d5, d3, e6 \u2014 but d3 has queen, so only if capturing.\n\nBut d3 is occupied by Black queen \u2014 so knight cannot go to d3.\n\nSo knight moves: f4 \u2192 g6, h5, h3, g2, e2, d5\n\nQueen on d3 \u2014 very active, attacking c3, e3, f3, d4, d5, d6, d2, d1, c4, e4, f5, g6, h7, etc.\n\nBut e3 is occupied by White rook.\n\nWhite has:\n- Queen on f7\n- Rook on e3\n- Pawns: a2, b2, c3, d6, f2, h4\n- King on g1\n\nBlack has:\n- Queen on d3\n- Knight on f4\n- King on g4\n- Rook on a8\n- Pawns: a6, b5, e6, h6\n\n---\n\n### **2. Immediate Threats**\n\nWhite has a **very strong queen on f7**, which is:\n- Attacking d7, e7, g7, h7, f8, f6, f5, f4\n- f4 is occupied by Black knight \u2014 so **White can play Qxf4+**, winning the knight with check!\n\nBut it's **Black to move**, so Black must prevent Qxf4+.\n\nWait \u2014 is Qxf4+ possible?\n\nWhite queen on f7, Black knight on f4 \u2014 yes, same file, 3 squares apart \u2014 queen can move from f7 to f4.\n\nIs anything blocking? f5, f6 \u2014 are they empty?\n\nFrom board:\n- f5: empty\n- f6: empty\n\nSo yes \u2014 **Qf7-f4+ is a legal move and a discovered check** (since king is on g4).\n\nSo **if Black does not move**, White plays Qxf4+, and Black must respond to check.\n\nBut it's Black's move \u2014 so Black **must** prevent Qxf4+.\n\nTherefore, **Black must move the knight on f4 or block the queen\u2019s path or capture the queen**.\n\nBut Black cannot capture the queen (no piece attacks f7), and cannot block f7-f4 (would need to put a piece on f5 or f6 \u2014 but no Black piece can go there immediately).\n\nSo **only way to prevent Qxf4+ is to move the knight**.\n\nTherefore, **all legal moves that do not move the knight are losing** because after, say, a6-a5, White plays Qxf4+ and wins the knight with check.\n\nSo we must **only consider moves of the knight on f4**.\n\nLet\u2019s check the legal moves list:\n\nLegal moves:\n- a8h8, a8g8, a8f8, a8e8, a8d8, a8c8, a8b8, a8a7 \u2014 rook moves (all bad, lose knight)\n- g4h4 \u2014 king to h4? But h4 has White pawn \u2014 cannot capture? Wait, h4 is occupied by White pawn \u2014 so g4h4 is **invalid**? But it's in the list.\n\nWait \u2014 the legal move list includes `g4h4` \u2014 but h4 has a White pawn. Can king capture? King on g4, h4 is occupied by White pawn \u2014 yes, king can capture: g4xh4.\n\nBut is that legal? Yes \u2014 if it doesn't leave king in check.\n\nBut let\u2019s not get distracted.\n\nOther moves:\n- f4g6, f4h5, f4d5, f4h3, f4g2, f4e2, f4d3? Wait \u2014 d3 has Black queen \u2014 so f4d3 would be knight to d3, but occupied \u2014 so invalid.\n\nBut in the list: `f4d5`, `f4g6`, `f4h5`, `f4h3`, `f4g2`, `f4e2` \u2014 these are all knight moves.\n\nAlso: `d3h7`, `d3g6`, etc. \u2014 queen moves.\n\nBut **if Black plays any move that doesn\u2019t move the knight or block Qxf4+, then White plays Qxf4+ and wins the knight with check**.\n\nSo unless the queen move **gives checkmate** or **wins material decisively**, it\u2019s losing.\n\nSo let\u2019s evaluate: **Can any Black"
