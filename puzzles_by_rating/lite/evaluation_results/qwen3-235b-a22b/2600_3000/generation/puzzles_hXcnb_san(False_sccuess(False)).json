When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

B  .  .  .  q\n6:  p  P  .  Q  .  p  .  .\n5:  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  h\n4:  .  .  .  .  b  .  p  P\n3:  R  .  P  .  .  f  P  .\n2:  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\n1:  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

K  .\n\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nPieces:\n- **Black**:\n  - King: a8\n  - Rook: c8\n  - Queen: h7\n  - Bishop: e4\n  - Pawns: a6, b7, f6, h5, g4, f3\n- **White**:\n  - King: g1\n  - Queen: d6\n  - Bishop: d7\n  - Rook: a3\n  - Pawns: b6, c3, g3, h4\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Position\n\n#### Material:\n- Black has rook, bishop, queen, 6 pawns = 1+3+9+6 = 19\n- White has rook, bishop, queen, 4 pawns = 1+3+9+4 = 17\n- So Black is **up a pawn**, but material is roughly balanced.\n\n#### Key Features:\n- **White queen on d6** is very active, threatening **checkmate** on c7 or b8.\n  - Qd6-c7#? c7 is defended by Black rook on c8.\n  - Qd6-b8#? That would be mate if not stopped \u2014 currently **a8 king**, b8 is empty, no defender on b8. So **Qb8# is a threat**.\n    - But is Qb8 possible? Yes \u2014 d6 to b8 is diagonal, and d6\u2013b8 passes through c7. Is c7 occupied? c7 has a black pawn? No \u2014 b7 is on b7, c7 is empty. So d6\u2013b8 is a diagonal move: d6-c7-b8. c7 is empty. So **Qb8# is a real threat**.\n\nWait: **White just played Qd6**, and it's Black's move. But if Black doesn't prevent it, White can play Qb8# next move.\n\nSo **Black is in immediate danger of being checkmated**.\n\nTherefore, **Black must prevent Qb8#**.\n\nHow can Black prevent Qb8#?\n\n- Block the diagonal: only square is c7. But c7 is empty. Can Black play a piece to c7?\n  - Black rook is on c8 \u2014 can play c8-c7.\n  - Black pawn on b7 \u2014 can't go to c7.\n  - No other piece can reach c7 except rook.\n- Capture the queen? Is any Black piece attacking d6?\n  - e4 bishop: e4\u2013d6 is diagonal. e4 to d6: e4-d5-c6-b7-a8? No \u2014 d6 is not on that diagonal. e4 to d6 is one square diagonally? e4 to d5 is diagonal, but d6 is up one more \u2014 e4-d5-c6? No, e4 to d6 is **not diagonal** \u2014 it's a knight move. So bishop on e4 cannot attack d6.\n  - Queen on h7: h7-d6? h7-g6-f5-e4-d3? No. h7 to d6 is not on same diagonal or file. h7 is h-file, d6 is d-file. Diagonally: h7-g6-f5-e4-d3-c2-b1 \u2014 not d6. So no.\n  - So no capture of queen.\n- Move the king? King on a8 \u2014 can it move?\n  - a8-b8? b8 is attacked by Qd6 via diagonal. So **b8 is under attack** \u2014 cannot go there.\n  - a8-a7? a7 is empty? a7 is empty \u2014 yes. But is a7 attacked?\n    - Qd6: can it attack a7? d6-c7-b8-a7? That\u2019s not a straight line. d6 to a7: difference of 3 files left, 1 rank down \u2014 not diagonal. So no.\n    - Bishop on d7: d7 attacks a7? d7-c6-b5-a4 \u2014 no. d7-e6-f5-g4-h3 \u2014 no. So no.\n    - So a7 is safe.\n    - But if king moves to a7, then Qb8+ still comes, and after Kb8, is there a defense?\n\nWait \u2014 if Black plays Ka8-a7, then White plays Qb8+, then Black must play Ka7-a6 or Ka7-b6? But a6 has a pawn, b6 is occupied by White pawn.\n\nKa7-a6: a6 has black pawn \u2014 blocked.\n\nKa7-b6: b6 is white pawn \u2014 can't go there.\n\nSo only move after Qb8+ would be Ka7-a8, but then Qb8+ repeats.\n\nBut actually, after Ka8-a7, White plays Qb8+? Is b8 attacking a7?\n\nQb8 attacks a7 \u2014 yes, adjacent diagonally.\n\nSo Qb8+ would give check to king on a7.\n\nAfter Ka8-a7, Qb8+ is check, and king has no escape \u2014 a8, a6, b7, b8 are all either occupied or attacked.\n\n- a8: not attacked? Qb8 attacks a8? Yes \u2014 adjacent diagonally. So a8 is attacked.\n- a6: has pawn \u2014 blocked.\n- b7: b7 has black pawn \u2014"
