When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

That\u2019s a **critical detail**.\n\nAlso, **White has a bishop on e6**, **queen on d5**, **pawn on d6**, and **Black\u2019s king is on h8**, potentially vulnerable to back-rank or mating threats.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Identify threats**\n\n#### **Immediate threats to White:**\n- **Bf1 is attacking the White king along the a2-g8 diagonal**, but currently only hits g1 if there\u2019s a discovered attack.\n  - But **Bf1 is on f1**, and **White\u2019s king is on g1**, so **if the bishop is protected**, it could be checking \u2014 but it's not giving check now because nothing is blocking the diagonal.\n  - Wait: **f1 is occupied by Black\u2019s bishop**, and **g1 is White\u2019s king** \u2014 so **the bishop on f1 is attacking g1** \u2014 but **only if the diagonal is open**.\n    - The f1\u2013g1 square is adjacent, so yes \u2014 **Bf1 is attacking g1 directly**.\n    - But **g1 is occupied by White\u2019s king**, so **Black is not checking** \u2014 but **if White moves a piece that allows a discovered attack**, it could be deadly.\n\nWait \u2014 **Bf1 is on f1**, and **g1 is White\u2019s king** \u2014 so **the bishop is on the same diagonal** (a6-f1-g1-h2), but **f1 to g1 is one square diagonally**, so **yes, Bf1 attacks g1**.\n\nBut **g1 is occupied by White\u2019s king**, so **Black is not checking** \u2014 but **if White moves a piece that was blocking**, it wouldn\u2019t matter \u2014 the bishop already sees the king.\n\nWait \u2014 **is Bf1 actually attacking the White king?**\n\n- f1 to g1 is a diagonal move (light-squared), and **Bf1 is a bishop**, so yes \u2014 **Bf1 attacks g1**.\n- But **g1 has White\u2019s king**, so **that would be a check** \u2014 but the position is White to move, so **Black is not in check**.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nWait \u2014 **if Black\u2019s bishop is on f1 and White\u2019s king is on g1**, then **the bishop is attacking the king**, so **Black is giving check** \u2014 but the FEN says it's White to move, and no check is indicated.\n\nSo this must mean: **either the FEN is wrong, or I misread the position**.\n\nLet me double-check the FEN:\n\n```\nr4r1k/p5b1/3BP3/1p1Q3p/4P2q/8/PP1N3P/R4bK1 w - - 1 26\n```\n\nLet\u2019s break it down rank by rank (from 8th to 1st):\n\n- **8th rank**: r4r1k \u2192 Rook, 4 empty, Rook, empty, King (h8) \u2192 a8=R, f8=R, h8=K\n- **7th rank**: p5b1 \u2192 pawn, 5 empty, bishop, 1 empty \u2192 a7=p, g7=B\n- **6th rank**: 3BP3 \u2192 3 empty, B, P, 3 empty \u2192 d6=B, e6=P? Wait \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 **3BP3** \u2192 3 empty, then B, P, then 3 empty \u2192 so d6=B, e6=P?\n\nBut in the FEN, **capital letters are White**, lowercase Black.\n\nSo:\n- 3BP3 \u2192 d6 = B (White bishop), e6 = P (White pawn)\n\nBut that can't be \u2014 **B and P are both White**, so White has a **bishop on d6** and **pawn on e6**?\n\nWait \u2014 no: **3BP3** means:\n- a6: empty\n- b6: empty\n- c6: empty\n- d6: B (White bishop)\n- e6: P (White pawn)\n- f6: empty\n- g6: empty\n- h6: empty\n\nBut earlier I thought the bishop was on e6 \u2014 no, it's on **d6**.\n\nWait \u2014 let's re-parse:\n\n```\nr4r1k  \u2192 8th: a8=r, b8=., c8=., d8=., e8=r, f8=., g8=., h8=k\np5b1   \u2192 7th: a7=p, b7=., c7=., d7=., e7=., f7=., g7=b, h7=.\n3BP3   \u2192 6th: a6=., b6=., c6=., d6=B, e6=P, f6=., g6=., h6=.\n1p1Q3p \u2192 5th: a5=., b5=p, c5=., d5=Q, e5=., f5=., g5=., h5=p\n4P2q   \u2192 4th: a4=., b4=., c4=., d4=P, e4=., f4=., g4=., h4=q\n8      \u2192 3rd: all empty\nPP1N3P \u2192 2nd: a2=P, b2=P, c2=., d2=N, e2=., f2=., g2=., h2=P\nR4bK1 \u2192 1st: a1=R, b1=., c1=., d1=., e1=., f1=b, g1=K, h1=.\n```\n\nAh! So:\n\n- **White king on g1**\n- **Black bishop on f1**\n- **White bishop on d6**\n- **White pawn on e6**\n- **White queen on d5**\n- **Black queen on h4**\n- **Black king on h8**\n\nNow \u2014 **Black bishop on f1**, **White king on g1** \u2014 are they on the same diagonal?\n\nf1 to g1 is a **knight move**, not a diagonal. Diagonals from f1:\n- f1\u2013g2\u2013h3\n- f1\u2013e2\u2013d3\u2013c4\u2013b5\u2013a6\n\ng1 is **not on a diagonal** with f1 \u2014 it's adjacent horizontally.\n\nSo **Bf1 does NOT attack Kg1** \u2014 they are on adjacent squares but not diagonal. So no check.\n\nGood \u2014 position is legal.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Identify key features**\n\n- **White has a strong bishop on d6**, attacking h2 and potentially involved in mating attacks.\n- **White pawn on e6** \u2014 supports d6 bishop, but could be a target.\n- **White queen on d5**, eyeing h5, f7, g8, etc.\n- **Black queen on h4**, threatening check on h2 if g2 is weak.\n- **Black bishop on f1** \u2014 deep in White\u2019s camp, possibly a threat or trapped?\n- **Black king on h8**, potentially vulnerable to back-rank mate.\n- **White has rook on a1**, not active.\n- **Knight on d2**, can go to f1, f3, c4, etc.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Look for tactical opportunities**\n\n#### **Is there a mating threat?**\n\nWhite queen on d5, bishop on d6 \u2014 both pointing toward the kingside.\n\nCan we play **Qh5+**? But h5 is occupied by a black pawn.\n\nd5 to h5 is **d5h5** \u2014 is that in the legal moves?\n\nYes: **d5h5** is in the list.\n\nLet\u2019s see: **Qd5 to h5** \u2014 attacks h5 pawn, but also **gives check** if the king is on h8.\n\nYes \u2014 **Qh5+** would be check.\n\nAfter **Qh5+**, Black must respond.\n\nPossible replies:\n- **gxh5**? But g7 has a bishop \u2014 **Bg7** \u2014 so **g7 pawn? No \u2014 a7=p, g7=b**, so **g7 is bishop**, not pawn.\n\nSo **g6 is empty**, h6 empty \u2014 so **no pawn on g7** \u2014 only bishop.\n\nSo after **Qh5+**, Black cannot play gxh5 \u2014 no g-pawn.\n\nBlack king on h8 \u2014 can"
