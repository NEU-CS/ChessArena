When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black has two rooks (g5, b2), king on g8, and some pawns.\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- Black rook on b2 is attacking White\u2019s rook on a2? Wait \u2014 **a2 is a White pawn**, not a rook. Let's double-check.\n\nWait \u2014 the FEN says: `Pr6` on rank 2 \u2192 `P` (White pawn on a2), `r` (Black rook on b2). So yes: **a2 = White pawn**, **b2 = Black rook**.\n\nSo Black rook on b2 is attacking the White pawn on a2. But that pawn is defended by the rook on a1.\n\nAlso, Black rook on g5 is on an open file, eyeing the 7th rank? But White king is on f1, so not immediately dangerous.\n\nWhite rook on c7 is on the 7th rank, attacking Black\u2019s pawn on a7 and potentially threatening back-rank issues.\n\nBut Black king is on g8, and White has a rook on c7 and a pawn on h5.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Look for tactical opportunities\n\nLet\u2019s consider **c7c8+** \u2014 promoting the rook to a rook on c8 with check?\n\nWait \u2014 c7 to c8 is moving the rook from c7 to c8. Is that check?\n\nLet\u2019s see: c8 is on the same file as c7. From c8, the rook would control the 8th rank.\n\nBlack king is on g8. So if White plays **c7c8**, the rook moves to c8, attacking along the 8th rank \u2014 and **yes**, the Black king is on g8, so **c7c8 is check**.\n\nIs it **checkmate**?\n\nAfter **c7c8**, the rook is on c8, attacking g8. Can the king escape?\n\n- g8 to f8? f8 is not attacked by anything else \u2014 only c8 rook attacks g8 along the rank. f8 is empty? Let's check.\n\nBoard:\n- f8: empty\n- h8: empty\n- g7: Black pawn\n\nSo king can go to f8 or h8.\n\nBut is f8 safe? Currently, no White piece attacks f8. h8 is also not attacked.\n\nSo **c7c8+** gives check, but **not checkmate** \u2014 king escapes to f8 or h8.\n\nBut after c7c8+, Black plays Kf8 or Kh8, and then White can follow up.\n\nBut is **c7c8+** even legal? Yes, it's in the legal moves list.\n\nWait \u2014 **c7c8** \u2014 is this a promotion? c7 to c8 \u2014 yes, but rook moving to 8th rank doesn't promote. Only pawns promote.\n\nWait! **c7 is a rook**, not a pawn. So c7c8 is just a rook move to c8 \u2014 **not a promotion**. So it's just **Rc8+**.\n\nYes \u2014 **c7c8** is **Rc8+**, delivering check.\n\nSo **Rc8+** is a strong move \u2014 forces the king to move.\n\nBut after **Kf8**, White can play something like Rc1 or connect rooks?\n\nBut let's see if there\u2019s something better.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **c7g7**?\n\nc7g7: rook from c7 to g7.\n\ng7 has a Black pawn. So this is a capture: **Rc7xg7**.\n\nIs that safe?\n\nAfter Rc7xg7, Black can play Rxg7 \u2014 the rook on g5 takes back.\n\nSo material: White trades rook for pawn and rook? No:\n\n- White plays Rc7xg7\n- Black replies Rxg7 \u2014 so White loses a rook, Black loses a pawn and a rook.\n- So equal material exchange, but White gave up a rook for a pawn and rook \u2014 actually, **White gains a pawn** in the trade.\n\nWait: White rook takes on g7 (pawn), Black rook takes back. So:\n- White loses rook\n- Black loses pawn (g7) and rook (g5)\n- So net: White gains a pawn (since rook for rook, but Black lost an extra pawn)\n\nBut White already has a rook on c7 \u2014 is it worth trading it for a pawn and forcing the rook trade?\n\nBut after Rc7xg7 Rxg7, then White has rook on a1 and king on f1, Black has rook on b2, king on g8, pawns on a7, d6, etc.\n\nBut now the g-file is open, and Black king is exposed.\n\nBut White may not have immediate follow-up.\n\nBut let\u2019s compare to **Rc8+**.\n\n### Candidate move: **c7c8** (Rc8+)\n\nAfter **Rc8+**, Black must move the king:\n- Kf8 or Kh8\n\nLet\u2019s suppose **Kf8**\n\nNow White can play **Rc1**, for example, to double rooks on the c-file? But c-file is not open.\n\nAlternatively, **a1c1** later.\n\nBut more importantly, after Kf8, the Black king is in the center, and White may have mating ideas?\n\nWait \u2014 is there a mating net?\n\nAlternatively, after Rc8+, if Black plays **Kh8**, then White can consider **h5h6**, threatening hxg7+ and mate?\n\nLet\u2019s explore:\n\nAfter:\n1. Rc8+ Kh8\n2. h5h6 gxh6\n3. ??\n\nNow g7 is gone, and White has a passed h-pawn.\n\nBut Black can play ...Rg6 or ...Rg4 to block.\n\nBut White has rook on c8, which is still on the 8th rank.\n\nBut no immediate mate.\n\nAlternatively, after Rc8+ Kf8, White can play **Rc1**, threatening to double rooks or attack on the a-file?\n\nBut not very forcing.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **c7g7**?\n\nRc7xg7 \u2014 if Black takes with Rxg7, then White has **a1c1!**, attacking the b2 rook?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n1. Rc7xg7 Rxg7\n2. Rc1! \u2014 now the rook on b2 is attacked.\n\nBlack must defend it. How?\n\n- Rb2b8? But a8 is empty, but then White can play Rc8+ again?\n- Or Rb2c2? But then White plays Rxc2, winning the rook.\n\nWait: after 2. Rc1, Black cannot save the rook:\n\n- Rb2b1? Then Rc1xb1, White wins rook.\n- Rb2d2? Rc1xd2\n- Rb2c2? Rc1xc2\n- Rb2a2? Then Rxa2, but a2 is White pawn \u2014 so R"
