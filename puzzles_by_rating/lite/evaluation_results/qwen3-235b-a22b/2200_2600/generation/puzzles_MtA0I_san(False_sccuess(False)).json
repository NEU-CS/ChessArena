When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

No \u2014 `a5P3` is not right.\n\nWait: Rank 3: `a5P3`? No \u2014 the string is: `a5P3`? Let's look:\n\nFEN: `8/8/6p1/4Pk1p/5P1P/p5P1/1p6/1K6`\n\nSo:\n- Rank 8: `8` \u2192 empty\n- Rank 7: `8` \u2192 empty\n- Rank 6: `6p1` \u2192 a6-h6: 6 empty, p on g6, then one empty \u2192 so g6: black pawn\n- Rank 5: `4Pk1p` \u2192 a5-d5: empty, e5: P (white), f5: k (black king), g5: empty, h5: p (black pawn)\n- Rank 4: `5P1P` \u2192 a4-e4: 5 empty, f4: P (white), g4: empty, h4: P (white)\n- Rank 3: `a5P3` \u2192 no: `a5P3`? Wait: `a5P3` isn't right.\n\nWait: Rank 3: `a5P3`? No \u2014 it's `a5P3`? Let's read: `a5P3`?\n\nNo: the string is: `a5P3`? No \u2014 it's `a5P3`? Wait, the FEN says: `/a5P3/`?\n\nNo: the FEN is: `8/8/6p1/4Pk1p/5P1P/a5P3/1p6/1K6`\n\nWait \u2014 no: the FEN is: `8/8/6p1/4Pk1p/5P1P/p5P1/1p6/1K6`\n\nSo:\n- Rank 3: `p5P1` \u2192 a3: p (black pawn), b3-e3: 5 empty, f3: P (white pawn), g3: 1 empty \u2192 so g3: empty? Wait: `p5P1` \u2192 p, then 5 empty, then P, then 1 empty \u2192 so a3: black pawn, f3: white pawn, g3: empty? No: `p5P1` \u2192 1 black pawn, 5 empty, 1 white pawn, 1 empty \u2192 so a3: p, f3: P, h3: empty? But g3 is missing.\n\nWait: `p5P1` \u2192 total 8 squares: p (a3), 5 empty (b3-f3? no \u2014 b3 to f3 is 5 squares? a3, b3, c3, d3, e3, f3 \u2192 that's 6.\n\nWait: `p5P1` \u2192 p, then 5 empty squares, then P, then 1 empty square \u2192 total: 1+5+1+1 = 8.\n\nSo:\n- a3: p (black pawn)\n- b3-f3: 5 empty\n- g3: P (white pawn)\n- h3: empty\n\nYes.\n\nRank 2: `1p6` \u2192 one empty, then b2: p (black pawn), then 6 empty \u2192 so b2: black pawn\n\nRank 1: `1K6` \u2192 one empty, b1: K (white king), then 6 empty\n\nSo summary:\n\n### Position:\n\n- White king: b1\n- Black king: f5\n- White pawns: e5, f4, g3, h4\n- Black pawns: a3, b2, g6, h5\n\nBlack has two dangerous connected passed pawns: a3 and b2. b2 is one step from queening.\n\nWhite has a pawn on e5, which is blocked by nothing, but black king is on f5, adjacent.\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLegal moves given: `b1c2`, `b1a2`, `e5e6`, `g3g4`\n\nSo only four legal moves.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move 1: `b1c2`\n\nKing moves to c2. Protects b3, but more importantly, threatens to stop the b2 pawn.\n\nAfter `b1c2`, black can play `b2b1q`, queening immediately.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nAfter `b1c2`, black plays `b2b1q+`, check! White king on c2, queen on b1 \u2014 is it check?\n\nb1 to c2 is diagonal \u2014 yes, queen on b1 attacks c2. So `b2b1q+` is check.\n\nWhite has no piece to block, and cannot capture the queen. So it's checkmate? No \u2014 king can move.\n\nKing on c2, check from b1 \u2014 king can go to c3, d2, d1, b2, b1 (but b1 occupied), a2, a1, c1.\n\nc3: is it attacked? After black queens, black has queen on b1, and other pawns.\n\nBut after `b1c2 b2b1q+`, white king must move. c3 is possible.\n\nBut then black has queen and pawns \u2014 likely winning.\n\nBut more importantly: is `b1c2` even legal? Yes, but after `b2b1q+`, white is lost.\n\nSo `b1c2` allows immediate queening with check \u2014 very bad.\n\nSo `b1c2` loses instantly.\n\nAvoid.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move 2: `b1a2`\n\nKing to a2.\n\nNow, if black plays `b2b1q`, then queen on b1, king on a2 \u2014 is it check?\n\nb1 to a2 is diagonal \u2014 yes, queen attacks a2. So `b2b1q+` is check.\n\nWhite king must move: a1, a3, b1, b2, b3.\n\na1: possible.\n\nBut again, black has queen and pawns \u2014 likely winning.\n\nBut can white prevent the promotion?\n\nAfter `b1a2`, black can play `a3a2`, then the a-pawn promotes next move unless stopped.\n\nBut after `a3a2`, white can play `b1xa2`, but king is on a2 already? No \u2014 white king moved to a2, so if black plays `a3a2`, it's capture: `a3a2` takes the king? No \u2014 pawns capture diagonally.\n\na3 to a2 is straight forward \u2014 not capture. But a2 is occupied by white king.\n\nSo `a3"
