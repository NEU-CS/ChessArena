When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Positional Overview**\n\n**Black\u2019s King**: on g8 \u2014 potentially vulnerable, but not immediately under direct attack.\n\n**White\u2019s pieces**:\n- Rook on c8 \u2014 extremely active, deep in Black\u2019s territory.\n- Queen on e3 \u2014 central, eyeing the kingside, possibly threatening h6 or g5.\n- Knight on g3 \u2014 supports h5 and defends f5.\n- Pawns on d4, e5, f4, g4, h5, b3 \u2014 strong center and kingside pawn majority.\n\n**Black\u2019s pieces**:\n- King on g8\n- Knight on f8 \u2014 somewhat passive, but can jump to e6 or g6.\n- Pawns: f6, e6, d5, h6, g7, b5, a5 \u2014 queenside majority, but some weaknesses.\n- Queen on b5 \u2014 active, attacking b3, but possibly hanging?\n- Rook on a2 \u2014 very active, pinning the b3 pawn (since moving b3 would expose the king on g1? Wait \u2014 no, White\u2019s king is not on g1. Let's check...\n\nWait \u2014 **where is White\u2019s king?**\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n```\n2R2nk1/6p1/4pp1p/qp1pP2P/3P1PP1/1P2Q1KN/r7/8\n```\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the board:\n\n```\n8:  -  -  R  -  -  N  K  -\n7:  -  -  -  -  -  -  P  -\n6:  -  -  -  -  P  P  -  P\n5:  q  p  -  p  P  -  -  P\n4:  -  -  -  P  -  P  P  -\n3:  -  P  -  -  Q  -  K  N\n2:  r  -  -  -  -  -  -  -\n1:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 that can't be right. Let's properly parse the FEN.\n\nFEN: `2R2nk1/6p1/4pp1p/qp1pP2P/3P1PP1/1P2Q1KN/r7/8 b - - 9 32`\n\nLet\u2019s go row by row:\n\n**Rank 8**: `2R2nk1` \u2192 `--R--nk-` \u2192 squares: a8=empty, b8=empty, c8=Rook, d8=empty, e8=empty, f8=Knight, g8=King, h8=empty\n\nWait \u2014 `nk1` \u2192 Knight, King, one empty \u2192 so f8=N, g8=K, h8=empty \u2192 but that would mean Black king on g8, and no h8 piece.\n\nBut `2R2nk1` \u2192 2 empty, R, 2 empty, n, k, 1 empty \u2192 so:\n\na8: empty  \nb8: empty  \nc8: R (White rook)  \nd8: empty  \ne8: empty  \nf8: n (Black knight)  \ng8: k (Black king)  \nh8: empty\n\nYes \u2014 so Black king is on g8, knight on f8.\n\n**Rank 7**: `6p1` \u2192 6 empty, then p, then 1 empty \u2192 a7-f7: empty, g7: p (Black pawn), h7: empty\n\n**Rank 6**: `4pp1p` \u2192 4 empty, f6=p, g6=p, 1 empty, h6=p \u2192 so d6,e6,f6,g6,h6: e6=?, f6=p, g6=p, h6=p \u2014 wait:\n\n4 empty \u2192 a6-d6 empty  \nthen f6=p, g6=p, then 1 empty (g6?), no:\n\n`4pp1p` \u2192 4 empty, then p, p, 1 empty, p \u2192 so:\n\na6-d6: empty  \ne6: p  \nf6: p  \ng6: empty  \nh6: p\n\nWait \u2014 that doesn't make sense. Let's count:\n\n- 4 empty: a6-d6\n- p: e6\n- p: f6\n- 1 empty: g6\n- p: h6\n\nSo: e6=p, f6=p, g6=empty, h6=p\n\nBut earlier I thought g6=p \u2014 correction: g6 is **empty**.\n\n**Rank 5**: `qp1pP2P`\n\n- q: a5\n- p: b5\n- 1 empty: c5\n- p: d5\n- P: e5 (White)\n- 2 empty: f5,g5\n- P: h5 (White)\n\nSo: a5=q (Black queen), b5=p (Black), c5=empty, d5=p (Black), e5=P (White), f5=empty, g5=empty, h5=P\n\n**Rank 4**: `3P1PP1`\n\n- 3 empty: a4-c4\n- P: d4 (White)\n- 1 empty: e4\n- P: f4 (White)\n- P: g4 (White)\n- 1 empty: h4\n\nSo: d4=P, e4=empty, f4=P, g4=P, h4=empty\n\n**Rank 3**: `1P2Q1KN`\n\n- 1 empty: a3\n- P: b3 (White)\n- 2 empty: c3,d3\n- Q: e3 (White queen)\n- 1 empty: f3\n- K: g3 (White king)\n- N: h3 (White knight)\n\nSo White king is on g3 \u2014 **in the open**, on the kingside, near advancing pawns.\n\n**Rank 2**: `r7` \u2192 Rook on a2 (Black), rest empty\n\n**Rank 1**: `8` \u2192 all empty\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Key Features**\n\n**White King**: on g3 \u2014 exposed, in front of pawns, potential target.\n\n**Black Rook on a2**: attacking the b3 pawn, which is defended only by the king (g3)? No \u2014 b3 is defended by c4? No c4 has no piece. b3 is defended only by... who?\n\nb3 pawn: attacked by a2 rook. Who defends it?\n\n- c4 is empty\n- a3 is empty\n- b4 is empty\n- c2 is empty\n\nSo b3 pawn is **only defended by the king on g3**? No \u2014 the king is on g3, far away.\n\nWait \u2014 is b3 defended at all?\n\nPieces near b3: c2? empty. a3? empty. b4? empty. c4? empty.\n\nSo **b3 pawn is hanging** \u2014 attacked by a2 rook, and **no defender**.\n\nWait \u2014 is that possible?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check:\n\n- Black rook on a2 attacks b2, c2, etc., but **b3** is one square diagonally? No \u2014 rook moves horizontally/vertically.\n\na2 rook is on a2 \u2014 it can move along the 2nd rank and the a-file.\n\nSo it attacks along a-file: a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8 \u2014 and along 2nd rank: b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2.\n\nSo **a2 rook does NOT attack b3** \u2014 b3 is not on same rank or file.\n\na2 to b3 is diagonal \u2014 rook can't move there.\n\nSo **b3 pawn is not attacked by a2 rook**.\n\nBut queen on a5 is on a5 \u2014 same file as a2 rook.\n\na5 queen \u2014 Black queen on a5.\n\na5 is on a5 \u2014 queen can move along a-file and 5th rank.\n\nSo queen on a5 attacks:\n\n- a-file: a6, a7, a8 (empty or pawns), a4, a3, a2 (rook), a1\n- 5th rank: b5, c5, d5, e5 (White pawn), f5, g5, h5\n\nSo queen on a5 attacks b5 (Black pawn), c5 (empty), d5 (Black pawn), e5 (White pawn), etc.\n\nBut **b3 is not on same file or rank as a5** \u2014 so not attacked.\n\nSo b3 pawn is **not under direct attack**.\n\nBut what about **a2 rook** \u2014 what does it attack?\n\na2 rook: on a2 \u2014 attacks:\n\n- a3, a4, a5, a6, a7,"
