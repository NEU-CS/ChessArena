When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/4kp2/p7/1p1PPpp1/1P5p/5K1P/P5P1/8 b - - 6 40\n```\n\nThis means:\n- It's **Black's move** (since the turn indicator is `b`).\n- The position is late endgame: both sides have few pieces.\n- Black has a king on f7, pawn on e7, a6, b5, f5, g4, h4.\n- White has king on f3, pawns on d5, e5, b4, a2, h3, g2.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Material and Pawn Structure**\n\n- **Black**: King on f7, pawns on e7, a6, b5, f5, g4, h4.\n- **White**: King on f3, pawns on d5, e5, b4, a2, h3, g2.\n\nWhite has two connected passed pawns on d5 and e5. Black has a backward e7-pawn and a potential queenside pawn on a6 and b5, but they are blocked.\n\nBlack has advanced kingside pawns: g4 and h4 \u2014 these are **very dangerous**. The g4 and h4 pawns are close to queening, and White\u2019s king is on f3 \u2014 right in the path.\n\nWhite\u2019s king is near the center but might be vulnerable to a mating net or forced promotion.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n1. **White has two central passed pawns** on d5 and e5. They are strong and can advance soon.\n2. **Black\u2019s king is on f7**, somewhat passive, but not in immediate danger.\n3. **Black\u2019s g4 and h4 pawns** are advanced. h4 is already on the 4th rank, g4 on 4th. With correct play, these could promote.\n4. **White\u2019s king is on f3**, which is very close to the g4 and h4 pawns. If Black can force the king away or create a mating net, promotion might be unstoppable.\n5. **Black to move** \u2014 we must choose from the legal moves:\n   - e7f8\n   - e7e8\n   - e7d8\n   - e7d7\n   - f7f6\n   - a6a5\n   - g5g4\n   - f5f4\n\nWait \u2014 **g5g4**? But there is no pawn on g5. Looking at the board:\n\n```\n8/4kp2/p7/1p1PPpp1/1P5p/5K1P/P5P1/8\n```\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the board:\n\n```\n8th: 8\n7th: 4kp2 \u2192 _ _ _ K P _ _ _\n6th: a6 \u2192 a P _ _ _ _ _ _\n5th: 1p1PPpp1 \u2192 _ P _ E E P P _ (E = empty)\n4th: 1P5p \u2192 _ P _ _ _ _ _ P\n3rd: 5K1P \u2192 _ _ _ _ _ K _ P\n2nd: A5P1 \u2192 P _ _ _ _ _ P _\n1st: 8\n```\n\nWait, let\u2019s do this properly:\n\nRank 8: `8` \u2192 empty\nRank 7: `4kp2` \u2192 4 empty, K, P, 2 empty \u2192 squares: a7-h7: _ _ _ _ k p _ _\nRank 6: `a6` \u2192 a6 has pawn, rest empty \u2192 a6: black pawn\nRank 5: `1p1PPpp1` \u2192 b5: black pawn, d5: white, e5: white, f5: black, g5: black, h5: empty\nWait \u2014 `1p1PPpp1` \u2192 1, p, 1, P, P, p, p, 1 \u2192 so:\na5: empty\nb5: black pawn\nc5: empty\nd5: white pawn\ne5: white pawn\nf5: black pawn\ng5: black pawn\nh5: empty\n\nBut in the FEN: `1p1PPpp1` \u2014 yes, so g5 has a black pawn.\n\nThen rank 4: `1P5p` \u2192 b4: white pawn, h4: black pawn\nrank 3: `5K1P` \u2192 f3: white king, h3: white pawn\nrank 2: `A5P1` \u2192 a2: white pawn, g2: white pawn\nrank 1: empty\n\nSo pawns:\n- Black: a6, b5, f5, g5, h4, e7\n- White: b4, d5, e5, h3, g2, a2\n\nBut wait \u2014 in the FEN: `1p1PPpp1` on rank 5 \u2192 so f5 and g5 are black pawns.\n\nBut in the list of legal moves: `g5g4` is listed.\n\nBut g5 is already occupied by a black pawn, and g4 is empty? No \u2014 rank 4: `1P5p` \u2192 only h4 has a pawn, so g4 is empty.\n\nSo g5g4 is a legal move: pawn from g5 to g4? But that\u2019s moving **backward** \u2014 pawns can't move backward.\n\nWait \u2014 **g5g4** is a **downward move** \u2014 from 5th rank to 4th \u2014 that\u2019s **backward** for Black. Pawns can't do that.\n\nThis must be an error.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the FEN is:\n\n`8/4kp2/p7/1p1PPpp1/1P5p/5K1P/P5P1/8`\n\nLet\u2019s parse it properly:\n\n- Rank 8: `8` \u2192 empty\n- Rank 7: `4kp2` \u2192 four empty, k, p, two empty \u2192 a7-d7: empty, e7: k, f7: p, g7-h7: empty \u2192 so **king on e7**, **pawn on f7**?\nWait \u2014 no: `4kp2` \u2192 4 squares empty, then k, p, then 2 empty \u2192 so e7: k, f7: p\n\nBut the FEN says `4kp2` \u2014 that\u2019s 4, k, p, 2 \u2014 so yes: e7: king, f7: pawn\n\nBut earlier I thought king was on f7 \u2014 no, it's on e7.\n\nWait \u2014 let's clarify:\n\nFEN: `8/4kp2/p7/1p1PPpp1/1P5p/5K1P/P5P1/8`\n\nBreakdown:\n\n- 8th rank: `8` \u2192 all empty\n- 7th rank: `4kp2` \u2192 4 empty, k, p, 2 empty \u2192 so a7-d7: empty, e7: black king, f7: black pawn, g7-h7: empty\n- 6th rank: `a7` \u2192 no, it's `a6` \u2192 so a6: black pawn\n- 5th rank: `1p1PPpp1` \u2192 b5: black pawn, d5: white pawn, e5: white pawn, f5: black pawn, g5: black pawn, h5: empty\n- 4th rank: `1P5p` \u2192 b4: white pawn, h4: black pawn\n- 3rd rank: `5K1P` \u2192 f3: white king, h3: white pawn\n- 2nd rank: `P5P1` \u2192 a2: white pawn, g2: white pawn\n- 1st rank: `8` \u2192 empty\n\nSo current position:\n\n**Black pieces**:\n- King: e7\n- Pawns: a6, b5, f5, g5, h4, f7, e7? No \u2014 e7 is king, f7 is pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 f7 is a **black pawn**, e7 is **black king**.\n\nBut the move list includes `e7f8`, `e7e8`, etc. \u2014 so king on e7.\n\nYes.\n\nSo Black king on e7, pawn on f7.\n\nWhite king on f3.\n\nNow, legal moves:\n\n- e7f8: king from e7 to f8\n- e7e8: king to e8\n- e7d8: king to d8\n- e7d7: king to d7\n- f7f6: pawn f7-f6\n- a6a5: pawn a6-a5\n- g5g4: pawn g5-g4 \u2014 but g5 is on 5th rank, g4 on 4th \u2014 that's **backward** for Black. Invalid.\nWait \u2014 Black pawns move **down** the board (from rank 7 to 1). So from g5 (rank 5) to g4 (rank 4) is **forward** \u2014 yes, it's a valid move.\n\nYes \u2014 Black pawns move from rank 7\u21926\u21925\u21924\u21923\u21922\u21921.\n\nSo g5 is rank 5, g4 is rank 4 \u2014 so g5g4 is advancing to 4"
