No \u2014 d2 is diagonal to c3?  \nd2 to c3 is one square diagonally \u2014 yes! **Bishop on d2 attacks c3**.\n\nSo:\n- c3 pawn is attacked by bishop\n- Defended only by knight on a4\n\nSo if the knight moves, c3 falls.\n\nBut if the knight doesn't move, Black might capture on c3, then promote.\n\nWait \u2014 c3 is on c3, and after capture, it would be c2 \u2014 which is occupied by the white king.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n- Black bishop captures on c3: Bxc3\n- Then c3 pawn is gone\n- But the c4 pawn is still on c4\n- After Bxc3, the c4 pawn can advance: c4-c3, then c3-c2, then c2-c1=Q\n\nBut c2 is occupied by the white king.\n\nSo if c3 is captured by bishop, then c4 pawn can go c4-c3, and then c3-c2 is blocked by king.\n\nBut king might have to move.\n\nWait \u2014 let's look at the pawn structure:\n\n- c4 (black), c3 (black), c2 (white king)\n\nSo the black pawns are on c4 and c3 \u2014 **connected passed pawns**.\n\nc3 is one step from c2.\n\nBut c2 is occupied by the white king.\n\nSo if Black plays ...c3-c2+, that would be check \u2014 because the king is on c2.\n\nYes! **c3-c2+ is a check**, since the pawn attacks b1 and d1, but not c2 directly \u2014 wait no.\n\nPawns move forward, capture diagonally.\n\nA pawn on c3 moves to c2? No \u2014 pawns cannot move backward.\n\n**Pawns move forward only**.\n\nSo from c3, a black pawn cannot go to c2 \u2014 it would have to go to c2 to promote, but that\u2019s backward.\n\nWait \u2014 **Black pawns move downward** (from rank 7 to rank 1).\n\nSo:\n- c4 is rank 4\n- c3 is rank 3\n- c2 is rank 2\n\nSo black pawn on c3 can move to c2 (down one), then c1 (down one) to promote.\n\nYes \u2014 **c3-c2 is a legal move**, and it attacks b1 and d1.\n\nBut c2 is currently occupied by the white king.\n\nSo **c3-c2 is not possible** \u2014 square is occupied.\n\nSo the c3 pawn is **blocked** by the white king on c2.\n\nSimilarly, c4 pawn can go to c3 \u2014 but c3 is occupied by another black pawn.\n\nSo the **c4 pawn cannot move** \u2014 it's blocked.\n\nSo the **black pawns are stuck** unless one is captured.\n\nBut the **c3 pawn is attacked by the bishop on d2** \u2014 and defended only by the knight on a4.\n\nSo if the knight moves, Bxc3 wins the pawn.\n\nAfter Bxc3, then the c4 pawn can advance: c4-c3, then c3-c2+ (check!), because c2 is now empty? No \u2014 king is still on c2.\n\nWait \u2014 after Bxc3:\n- Bishop captures on c3\n- c3 pawn is removed\n- Now c4 pawn can go c4-c3\n- Then c3-c2+ \u2014 but c2 is occupied by king\n- So c3-c2 is not possible \u2014 again blocked.\n\nBut **c3-c2+ is a check only if it captures**, but it doesn't capture \u2014 it's a push.\n\nWait \u2014 no: a pawn moving straight forward doesn't give check unless it promotes.\n\nc3-c2 is not check \u2014 it's just a move.\n\nBut it's blocked by the king.\n\nSo **the black pawns cannot advance past c2 because the white king is on c2**.\n\nSo the **white king is blocking the promotion**.\n\nThat\u2019s key.\n\nSo the **c2 king is holding the black pawns at bay**.\n\nIf the king moves away, then ...c3-c2+ or ...c4-c3 followed by ...c3-c2+ becomes possible.\n\nBut currently, **c3-c2 is impossible** because c2 is occupied.\n\nSo the **black pawns are frozen** as long as the white king stays on c2 or c1.\n\nBut the **c3 pawn is under attack by the bishop on d2**, and only defended by the knight on a4.\n\nSo if the knight moves, **Bxc3 wins a pawn**.\n\nAfter Bxc3, black has pawns on c4 and ... well, c3 is gone, so only c4.\n\nBut c4 can go to c3, but then stuck again if king is on c2.\n\nSo material loss, but not immediately losing.\n\nBut White is already down a pawn \u2014 losing another would be worse.\n\nSo we must be careful.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the **knight on a4**.\n\nIt defends c3.\n\nIt can move to:\n- b6: a4b6\n- c5: a4c5\n- c3: a4c3 \u2014 but c3 is occupied by black pawn \u2014 can\u2019t go there\nWait \u2014 a4c3: is that legal?\n\na4 to c3 is two squares right, one down \u2014 that\u2019s a knight move.\n\nBut c3 has a black pawn \u2014 so"

But this is not critical for the current position.\n\n**Current legal moves (for White):**\n- `c2c3` \u2013 King moves from c2 to c3\n- `c2d1` \u2013 King to d1\n- `c2c1` \u2013 King to c1\n- `c2b1` \u2013 King to b1\n- `h2h3` \u2013 Pawn to h3\n- `h2h4` \u2013 Pawn to h4\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate the position\n\n**Material:**\n- White: King, two pawns (g4, h2)\n- Black: King, bishop, two pawns (c4, g5)\n\nWhite is down a bishop (Black has a bishop on c3), but the material is roughly balanced: White has two pawns, Black has two pawns and a bishop. However, the bishop is currently **on c3**, **attacking the white king on c2**.\n\nWait \u2014 is that correct?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check:\n\n- Black bishop is on **c3**\n- White king is on **c2**\n\nYes \u2014 the bishop on c3 is **attacking the white king on c2**. That means the king is **in check**.\n\nBut the FEN says it's White to move. That can't happen if the king is in check unless the position is illegal.\n\nWait \u2014 this is a **critical observation**.\n\n### Is the position legal?\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- Black bishop on c3\n- White king on c2\n- No pieces between them\n- The bishop attacks c2 diagonally: c3 to c2 is a diagonal move? No \u2014 c3 to c2 is **vertical**, not diagonal.\n\nWait \u2014 **c3 and c2 are on the same file** \u2014 that\u2019s a vertical line.\n\nBishops move diagonally, not vertically.\n\nSo **bishop on c3 does NOT attack c2**.\n\nc3 to c2 is one square down \u2014 that\u2019s a **rook or king move**, not a bishop.\n\nSo the **bishop on c3 does not attack the king on c2**.\n\nLet\u2019s confirm the diagonal:\n\n- From c3, a bishop moves along:\n  - c3 \u2192 b4 \u2192 a5\n  - c3 \u2192 d4 \u2192 e5 \u2192 f6 \u2192 g7 \u2192 h8\n  - c3 \u2192 b2 \u2192 a1\n  - c3 \u2192 d2 \u2192 e1\n\nAh! **d2** is on the diagonal.\n\nBut the king is on **c2**, not d2.\n\nc2 is adjacent to c3 vertically, but not on a diagonal.\n\nSo **bishop on c3 does not attack c2** \u2014 they are adjacent vertically, but a bishop cannot attack vertically.\n\nSo the king is **not in check**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there any other threat?\n\nBlack king is on e4 \u2014 not near.\n\nBlack pawn on c4 \u2014 could capture on d3 or b3, but no white pieces there.\n\nWhite king on c2 \u2014 safe.\n\nSo the position is **legal**, and White is to move.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the goals\n\nWhite has:\n- King on c2\n- Pawns on g4, h2\n\nBlack has:\n- King on e4\n- Bishop on c3\n- Pawns on c4, g5\n\nWhite\u2019s pawns are on g4 and h2 \u2014 potential to push h-pawn to promote.\n\nBlack\u2019s bishop is on c3 \u2014 it\u2019s active, eyeing the h2 pawn and potentially the kingside.\n\nBut currently, **the bishop on c3 is **attacking h2** \u2014 yes, c3 to h2 is a diagonal?**\n\nc3 \u2192 d4 \u2192 e5 \u2192 f6 \u2192 g7 \u2192 h8 \u2014 no, that\u2019s one diagonal.\n\nc3 \u2192 d2 \u2192 e1 \u2014 that\u2019s the other light-squared diagonal.\n\nh2 is on **h2** \u2014 what color square? h2 is **black square**.\n\nc3 is **c3** \u2014 c-file, 3rd rank \u2014 c3 is a **dark square** (a1 is dark, so c3 is dark).\n\nh2 is a **light square**.\n\nSo bishop on c3 (dark-squared bishop) cannot control h2 (light square). So **bishop does not attack h2**.\n\nSo h2 pawn is **safe** for now.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: can Black\u2019s bishop ever get involved?\n\nIt\u2019s on c3, which is deep in White\u2019s territory, but may be trying to target the kingside.\n\nBut White\u2019s immediate concern is **king activity** and **pawn promotion**.\n\nWhite has a **passed pawn** on g4, and h2 \u2014 but g4 is already advanced.\n\nBlack has a passed pawn on g5 \u2014 so **both sides have passed pawns on the kingside**.\n\nBut Black\u2019s g5 pawn is ahead \u2014 it's on g5, White\u2019s on g4.\n\nSo Black is one step closer to promotion.\n\nBut Black\u2019s king is on e4 \u2014 not helping the g5 pawn.\n\nWhite\u2019s king is on c2 \u2014 far away.\n\nSo this is a **race**: can White push h-pawn to h7-h8=Q before Black promotes g5-g4-g3-g2-g1=Q?\n\nBut White has the move.\n\nAlso, White has a pawn on c4? No \u2014 **c4 is a black pawn**.\n\nWait: FEN: `8/8/8/6p1/2p1k1P1/2b5/2K4P/8`\n\nLet\u2019s decode rank by rank (from rank 8 to 1):\n\n- 8: `8` \u2192 empty\n- 7: `8` \u2192 empty\n- 6: `8` \u2192 empty\n- 5: `6p1` \u2192 six empty, then g5 (black pawn), then one empty \u2192 so black pawn on g5\n- 4: `2p1k1P1` \u2192 two empty, c4 (black pawn), one empty, e4 (king), one empty, g4 (white pawn), one empty \u2192 so black pawn on c4, black king on e4, white pawn on g4\n- 3: `2b5` \u2192 two empty, c3 (black bishop), five empty \u2192 black bishop on c3\n- 2: `2K4P` \u2192 two empty, c2 (white king), four empty, h2 (white pawn)\n- 1: `8` \u2192 empty\n\nSo:\n- White: Kc2, Pg4, Ph2\n- Black: Ke4, Bc3, Pc4, Pg5\n\nSo **White has no pawn on c3** \u2014 earlier move `d2c3` must have been a capture: a white pawn captured on c3 (from d2), but now there\u2019s a black bishop on c3 \u2014 so perhaps the position after `a4c3` (knight to c3), then `d2c3` (pawn captures knight), but now the bishop is on c3 \u2014 so maybe Black recaptured? But the FEN shows bishop on c3, so likely the current position is after more moves.\n\nBut we don\u2019t need the full history \u2014 we have the current position.\n\nNow, back to strategy.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the legal moves\n\nLegal moves for White:\n1. `c2c3` \u2014 King to c3\n2. `c2d1` \u2014 King to d1\n3. `c2c1` \u2014 King to c1\n4. `c2b1` \u2014 King to b1\n5. `h2h3` \u2014 Pawn to h3\n6. `h2h4` \u2014 Pawn to h4\n\nWe must pick the best.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate move: `c2c3`\n\nKing moves to c3.\n\nBut **c3 is occupied by a black bishop**.\n\nCan the king capture it?\n\nYes \u2014 if it's legal.\n\nIs c3 attacked? Only if moving there puts the king in check.\n\nBut king on c3: is it attacked?\n\n- Black king on e4 \u2014 too far\n- Black bishop \u2014 if captured, it's gone\n- Black pawns: c4 and g5 \u2014 c4 pawn attacks b3 and d3 \u2014 not c3\n- So no piece attacks c3\n\nSo `c2c3` is a **capture of the black bishop**.\n\nThis is **very important**.\n\nSo `c2c3` = Kxc3 \u2014 White captures the bishop.\n\nAfter that, material becomes:\n- White: king, two pawns\n- Black: king, two pawns (c4, g5)\n\nSo White is up a bishop \u2014 **a huge material gain**.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nAfter `c2c3`, Black plays ...?\n\nBlack has:\n- King on e4\n-"

So the white king is on c3.\n\nBut we also see **c3c2** as a legal move \u2014 that would be a pawn move only if there were a pawn on c3. But the FEN shows no pawn on c3 \u2014 only king on c3.\n\nWait \u2014 contradiction?\n\nHold on. The FEN says: `.../2K5/7P/...` \u2014 so only king on c3 and h2 pawn.\n\nBut the legal moves include **c3c2**, **c3b4**, etc. These are **king moves** \u2014 so c3 must be the king.\n\nBut then why is **c3c2** listed? That would be king from c3 to c2.\n\nYes \u2014 that\u2019s a legal king move.\n\nBut the move history includes:\n- a4c3 \u2014 a piece moves from a4 to c3\n- d2c3 \u2014 d2 to c3\n- c2c3 \u2014 c2 to c3\n- e4d5\n\nWait \u2014 multiple moves to c3?\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the move history:\n\n1. a4c3 \u2014 likely a knight from a4 to c3? But in the current position, there is no knight. Only king on c3.\n2. d2c3 \u2014 pawn or piece from d2 to c3\n3. c2c3 \u2014 pawn from c2 to c3\n4. e4d5 \u2014 pawn from e4 to d5? But no white pawn on e4.\n\nThis seems inconsistent with the current FEN.\n\nBut the problem says: \"Partial move history\" \u2014 maybe not all moves are listed, or it's corrupted.\n\nBut we are told to trust the **current FEN** and the **list of legal moves**.\n\nSo let\u2019s **ignore the move history** \u2014 it may be misleading or incomplete.\n\nWe go by the **FEN** and the **legal moves**.\n\nSo current position:\n\n- White king: c3\n- White pawns: g4, h2\n- Black king: d5\n- Black pawns: c4, g5\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait \u2014 FEN: `.../2p3P1/...` \u2014 on rank 4: `2p3P1` \u2192 so c4 is black pawn, g4 is white pawn.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, legal moves include **c3b4**, **c3d2**, etc. \u2014 all king moves from c3.\n\nBut also **c3c2** \u2014 king from c3 to c2? That\u2019s a legal king move.\n\nBut why is **c3c2** listed? That would be king retreating.\n\nBut also **h2h3**, **h2h4** \u2014 pawn moves.\n\nSo only pieces are:\n- White: Kc3, Pg4, Ph2\n- Black: Kd5, Pc4, Pg5\n\nNo other pieces.\n\nNow, goal: find the best move from the legal list:\n- c3b4\n- c3d2\n- c3c2\n- c3b2\n- h2h3\n- h2h4\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the position\n\nMaterial is equal. It's a king and pawn endgame.\n\nWhite has pawns on g4 and h2; Black has pawns on c4 and g5.\n\nWhite\u2019s pawns are on the kingside; Black\u2019s on queenside (c4) and kingside (g5).\n\nBut note: **c4 is a passed pawn for Black**, and it's only on c4 \u2014 one step from queening.\n\nBut White\u2019s king is on c3 \u2014 very close to stopping it.\n\nBlack king is on d5 \u2014 also close.\n\nBut **c4 is a protected passed pawn?** No \u2014 no black pawn supports it. But it can advance.\n\nLet\u2019s assess threats.\n\n**Black\u2019s threat**: c4-c3-c2 and promote. But White king is on c3 \u2014 currently **occupying c3**, so c4-c3 is blocked.\n\nSo pawn on c4 is **blocked** by the white king.\n\nBut if the white king moves away, Black can play c4-c3, and then c3-c2, threatening promotion.\n\nSo **White must not leave c3 unattended unless necessary**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 if White king moves, say, to b4, then Black plays c4-c3, and the pawn is very dangerous.\n\nSo **king must stay near c3** to prevent c4-c3.\n\nBut perhaps White can **capture** the pawn?\n\nCan White king take on c4? c3-c4 \u2014 is that legal?\n\nc3 to c4 \u2014 is that a legal move? But it's not in the list.\n\nLegal moves are:\n- c3b4\n- c3d2\n- c3c2\n- c3b2\n- h2h3\n- h2h4\n\nSo **c3c4 is not listed** \u2014 why?\n\nBecause **c4 is occupied by a black pawn** \u2014 so king can\u2019t go to c4 unless it captures \u2014 but c3-c4 would be a capture, but it\u2019s not listed.\n\nWait \u2014 is c3-c4 a legal move?\n\nKing on c3, pawn on c4 \u2014 so c3-c4 would **capture** the pawn.\n\nBut it\u2019s not in the legal moves list.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause **after capturing on c4, the black king on d5 could recapture?**\n\nBut let\u2019s see: if White plays Kxc4, then Black plays Kxc4 \u2014 and then White is king on c4, Black king on c4 \u2014 but then Black has pawn on g5, White has pawns on g4 and h2.\n\nBut is Kxc4 legal?\n\nYes \u2014 king can capture a pawn on c4.\n\nBut it\u2019s **not in the list of legal moves**.\n\nThe legal moves provided are only:\n- c3b4\n- c3d2\n- c3c2\n- c3b2\n- h2h3\n- h2h4\n\nSo **c3c4 is missing** \u2014 which suggests that **c3c4 is not legal**.\n\nWhy?\n\nOnly possible reason: **c3-c4 is illegal because it would place the king in check**.\n\nBut how? Black has no pieces \u2014 only king and pawns.\n\nCan the black king on d5 attack c4? Yes \u2014 d5 to c4 is a king move \u2014 so c4 is attacked by black king.\n\nSo if White plays Kc3-c4, the king moves into a square attacked by the black king \u2014 **illegal**.\n\nYes! That\u2019s it.\n\nSo **c4 is attacked by black king on d5**, so White king cannot capture on c4.\n\nTherefore, **Kxc4 is illegal**.\n\nSo the c4 pawn is **protected by the black king** \u2014 it\u2019s a **protected passed pawn**.\n\nBut it\u2019s blocked by the white king.\n\nSo the position is **critical**.\n\nWhite king on c3 is **blocking** c4 pawn, but cannot capture it.\n\nIf White king moves away, Black plays c4-c3, and then the pawn is very strong.\n\nSo **White must keep the king near c3** to prevent c4-c3.\n\nBut if White does nothing, Black can play **Kd5-e5** or **Kd5-d4**, centralizing, and then support the c-pawn.\n\nBut it\u2019s White\u2019s move.\n\nNow, what are the options?\n\n### Candidate moves:\n\n1. **c3"
