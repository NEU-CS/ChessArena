When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

K  .  .  . \n    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate the position\n\n**Material:**\n- White: Queen (a3), pawns (a2, c5, g3, h2)\n- Black: Queen (b7), pawns (a7, h6, g5, e4), king (e6)\n\nMaterial is roughly equal (queen vs queen, similar pawns), but **White has a dangerous protected passed pawn on c5**, which is only two squares from queening if supported.\n\n**Key features:**\n- c5 pawn is advanced and protected by nothing currently, but can be supported.\n- Black queen on b7 is defending the a7 pawn and eyeing the c5 pawn.\n- White queen on a3 is attacking along the 3rd rank and can target weak squares.\n- Black king on e6 is somewhat exposed.\n- e4 pawn blocks central files.\n- White king is passive on e1.\n\n**Immediate threats:**\n- Black might play ...Qb7xc5, winning the pawn if not defended.\n- But currently, White can **defend c5** or **push c6**, or even **sacrifice** to promote.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the **key idea**: **c5-c6**.\n\n### Try: **c5c6**\n\nAfter **c5c6**, the pawn moves to c6, threatening to promote on c7 next move if not stopped.\n\nBlack must respond.\n\nWhat can Black do?\n\n- If Black takes with a7xc6, then **Qa3xa7** wins the pawn and attacks the back rank. Black\u2019s queen is on b7, so after Qa7, Black must deal with mate threats or loss of queen.\n- If Black plays ...Qb7-b6, then **c6c7**! and the pawn promotes next move.\n  - After c7, Qb6xc7?? Qa3-e7+ skewers king and queen: Ke6-f6, Qe7-f8+ forces king up, and wins queen.\n- If Black plays ...Qb7-d7, then c7, and again promotion is unstoppable unless queen takes, but Qd7xc7?? Qa3-e7+ again wins queen.\n\nSo **c5c6** is very strong.\n\nLet\u2019s test it:\n\n1. **c5c6** \u2014 pawn advances\n   - Now c6, threatening c7.\n\nBlack options:\n- **a7xc6**: a7 pawn takes c6\n  - Then **Qa3xa7** \u2014 White wins a pawn, and now has a dangerous queen on a7.\n    - Black\u2019s queen is on b7, so after Qa7, Black cannot take because Qb7xa7?? loses queen to Qa7-b7+ or just captures.\n    - Actually: Qa3xa7, then Qb7-b1+ (check), Ke1-f2, and Black harasses, but White is up a pawn and has c6 pawn still? No \u2014 c6 was captured.\n\nWait: if a7xc6, then c5c6 is captured, so c6 pawn is gone. So after Qa3xa7, Black has queen on b7, White queen on a7.\n\nBut now Black can play Qb7-b1+ check, Ke1-f2, Qb1-b2+ Ke1-f1? But White is up a pawn, and Black\u2019s king is exposed.\n\nBut more importantly: **after c5c6, if Black does not take, then c6c7 is crushing**.\n\nSo Black **must** take: **a7xc6** is forced.\n\nThen **Qa3xa7**.\n\nNow position:\n- White queen on a7\n- Black queen on b7\n- White can play Qa7-a5+ or Qa7-c5+, forking king and queen?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAfter:\n1. c5c6 a7xc6\n2. Qa3xa7\n\nNow Black plays **Qb7-b1+**, check.\n\nWhite must respond:\n- Ke1-f2 (only safe square)\n\nNow Black: Qb1-b2+ Ke1-f1? Or Qb1-d1+?\n\nBut Black is just checking, not gaining much.\n\nBut White is up a pawn, and has a strong queen.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **tactical refutation**?\n\nWait \u2014 after **c5c6**, what if Black plays **Qb7-b5** instead of taking?\n\nThen **c6c7!** \u2014 pawn to c7, threatening queening.\n\nBlack must take: Qb5xc7\n\nThen **Qa3-e7+** \u2014 check!\n\nKe6-f6 (only)\n\nNow White: **Qe7-f8+** \u2014 check\n\nKf6-g6\n\nNow Qf8-g8+ Kh6? But h6 is occupied by black pawn.\n\nWait: g8 is empty?\n\nBoard: g8 is empty.\n\nAfter Qf8-g8+, Black king goes to f6, g6, or f5?\n\nAfter Qe7+ Ke6-f6\n\nQf8+ Kf6-g6\n\nNow Qg8+ Kg6-h5? Or Kh6?\n\nBut h6 has a black pawn.\n\nSo Kh5 is possible? h5 is empty.\n\nBut then Qg8-h7+ or Qg8-h8+? But not immediate mate.\n\nBut more importantly: after Qb5xc7, Qe7+ wins the black queen!\n\nBecause:\n- Qe7+ forces Ke6-f6\n- Then Qe7-f8+ forces Kf6-g6\n- Then Qf8-g8+ forces Kg6-h5 (only, since g5 has pawn)\n- Then Qg8-h7+ Kh5-g4\n- But now White can play Qh7-g6+? No, not possible.\n\nWait \u2014 actually, after Qe7+ Ke6-f6, Qf8+ Kf6-g6, Qg8+ Kg6-h5, then Qh7+ Kh5-g4, Qg6+? No.\n\nBut Black can just move queen away.\n\nWait \u2014 no: after Qb5xc7, it's Black's move.\n\nAfter:\n1. c5c6 Qb7-b5\n2. c6c7 Qb5xc7\n3. Qa3-e7+ Ke6-f6\n4. Qe7-f8+ Kf6-g6\n5. Qf8-g8+ Kg6-h5\n\nNow White has Qg8, but Black can play ...Qc7-a5+, forking king and queen?\n\nQc7-a5+ check!\n\nWhite king on e1? No \u2014 still on e1? Wait no: we are at move 5, but White king hasn't moved.\n\nWait \u2014 **huge mistake!**\n\nWhite king is still on e1.\n\nAfter 1. c5c6 Qb7-b5\n2. c6c7 Qb5xc7\n3. Qa3-e7+ Ke6-f6\n4. Qe7-f8+ Kf6-g6\n5. Qf8-g8+ Kg6-h5\n\nBut now, **Black plays Qc7-a5+**, check on the white king!\n\nWhite king is on e1 \u2014 so Qa5+ is check!\n\nKe1-f2 or Ke1-d2?\n\nThen Black wins the white queen? No, White queen is on g8.\n\nBut Black queen gives check, and White must block or move king.\n\nBut this doesn't win material, but it stops the attack.\n\nBut White is not winning.\n\nSo this line is messy.\n\nBut earlier, if Black takes with a7xc6, then Qa3xa7, and Black checks, but White is up a pawn.\n\nBut is there a **better move than c5c6**?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **a3a7** \u2014 queen takes on a7.\n\nTry: **a3a7**\n\nQa3xa7\n\nNow Black can play **Qb7-b1+**, check.\n\nKe1-f2\n\nThen Q"
