When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Wait, let's parse properly.\n```\n\nWait \u2014 FEN is row-by-row from rank 8 down to 1.\n\nSo:\n\n```\n8:  - - - - - - - -   (empty)\n7:  R - - - - - - -   (White rook on a7)\n6:  - - - e6 k6 p6 p6 p6 \u2192 actually: 3 pieces then pawns: 3pkppp \u2192 so: - - - p k p p p \u2192 but that\u2019s 7 squares? Wait:\n```\n\nLet\u2019s decode each rank properly:\n\n- `8` \u2192 8 empty squares \u2192 rank 8: `........`\n- `R7` \u2192 R + 7 empty \u2192 `R.......` \u2192 rank 7\n- `3pkppp` \u2192 3 empty, p, k, p, p, p \u2192 `...pkppp` \u2192 rank 6\n- `8` \u2192 `........` \u2192 rank 5\n- `5PPP` \u2192 5 empty, then P P P \u2192 `.....PPP` \u2192 rank 4\n- `4PK2` \u2192 4 empty, P, K, 2 empty \u2192 `....PK..` \u2192 rank 3\n- `1r6` \u2192 1 empty, r, 6 empty \u2192 `.r......` \u2192 rank 2\n- `8` \u2192 `........` \u2192 rank 1\n\nNow place it all:\n\n```\n   a b c d e f g h\n8: - - - - - - - -   (8)\n7: R - - - - - - -   (7)\n6: - - - p k p p p   (6)\n5: - - - - - - - -   (5)\n4: - - - - - P P P   (4)\n3: - - - - P K - -   (3)\n2: - r - - - - - -   (2)\n1: - - - - - - - -   (1)\n```\n\nWait \u2014 rank 6: `3pkppp` \u2192 3 empty, then p, k, p, p, p \u2192 so:\n\n- d6: p (Black pawn)\n- e6: k (Black king)\n- f6: p (Black pawn)\n- g6: p (Black pawn)\n- h6: p (Black pawn)\n\nBut kings are denoted by K/k, so `k` is Black king.\n\nSo Black king is on e6.\n\nWhite king is on f3 (from `PK` on e3 and f3? Wait: `4PK2` \u2192 four empty, then P, K, then two empty \u2192 so:\n\n- e4: P (White pawn)\n- f3: K (White king)\n\nWait \u2014 `4PK2` is on rank 3 \u2192 so:\n\n- a3 to d3: empty\n- e3: P (White pawn)\n- f3: K (White king)\n- g3 and h3: empty\n\nBut earlier rank 4: `5PPP` \u2192 a4-e4 empty, f4, g4, h4: P, P, P\n\nSo White pawns: f4, g4, h4, e3\n\nWait \u2014 e3 is a White pawn? Yes.\n\nSo White king is on f3.\n\nBlack king is on e6.\n\nBlack has a rook on b2 (from `1r6` on rank 2 \u2192 b2)\n\nWhite has a rook on a7.\n\nNow let\u2019s list all pieces:\n\n### Position:\n\n```\n   a b c d e f g h\n8:  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . \n7:  R  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   (White rook a7)\n6:  .  .  .  p  k  p  p  p   (Black: d6=p, e6=K, f6=p, g6=p, h6=p)\n5:  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . \n4:  .  .  .  .  .  P  P  P   (f4,g4,h4 = White pawns)\n3:  .  .  .  .  P  K  .  .   (e3 = White pawn, f3 = White king)\n2:  .  r  .  .  .  .  .  .   (b2 = Black rook)\n1:  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . \n```\n\n### Material:\n\n- White: Rook (a7), King (f3), pawns: e3, f4, g4, h4\n- Black: King (e6), Rook (b2), pawns: d6, f6, g6, h6\n\nIt's **Black to move**.\n\n### Legal moves provided:\n\n```\ne6d5, b2b8, b2b7, b2b6, b2b5, b2b4, b2b3, b2b2h2, b2g2, b2f2, b2e2, b2d2, b2c2, b2a2, b2b1, h6h5, g6g5, f6f5, d6d5\n```\n\nWait \u2014 `b2h2` is listed twice? Probably typo. But we\u2019ll assume the list is:\n\n- King: e6 \u2192 d5\n- Rook: b2 \u2192 b8, b7, b6, b5, b4, b3, h2, g2, f2, e2, d2, c2, a2, b1\n- Pawns: h6h5, g6g5, f6f5, d6d5\n\nNote: d6d5 is a pawn move, e6d5 is king move.\n\nNow, evaluate the position.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **White has a strong pawn center and advanced kingside pawns** (f4,g4,h4), and king on f3 \u2014 aiming to push pawns.\n2. **White rook is on a7**, behind Black\u2019s pawn on d6? No \u2014 a7 is on the 7th rank, but Black has no pawn on a-file. Actually, a7 is deep in Black\u2019s territory, but currently not doing much unless it can become active.\n3. **Black rook is on b2**, attacking the e3 pawn? No \u2014 b2 is on the second rank, and e3 is on e3 \u2014 not aligned. But it **attacks along the 2nd rank** and can potentially target e3, f3, etc.\n4. **Black king is on e6**, somewhat exposed. White king is on f3 \u2014 both kings are active.\n5. **White has a passed pawn on e3?** No \u2014 e3 is blocked? No \u2014 d6 is on d6, not d3. So e3 is isolated? But no Black pawn on e-file. So e3 is a passed pawn? Possibly.\n\nWait \u2014 Black has d6, but no e-pawn. So e3 is a **passed pawn** \u2014 it can advance to e4, e5, etc.\n\nBut currently, e3 is on e3, and no Black pawn on e-file \u2014 so yes, **White has a passed e-pawn**.\n\nBut it\u2019s not very far advanced.\n\n### Black\u2019s goals:\n\n- Prevent White\u2019s pawns from advancing (especially e3 \u2192 e4 \u2192 e5 etc.)\n- Use rook to harass White king or pawns.\n- Avoid losing the rook or king getting mated.\n- Try to create counterplay.\n\nBut Black is **defensive** here \u2014 White has more space and active king.\n\nNow, let\u2019s analyze the **critical threats**.\n\n### Is e3-e4 coming?\n\nYes \u2014 White wants to play e4 to support e5, centralizing and freeing the king.\n\nBut if Black plays ...d6-d5, that would **block the e3 pawn** \u2014 because after e4, exd5 would open the e-file, but d5 would stop e4.\n\nWait \u2014 if Black plays d6-d5, then e3-e4 is still possible, but then e4xd5 would open the e-file.\n\nBut d6-d5 also **frees the diagonal** for the king to go to d6 or f6.\n\nBut more importantly: **if Black plays e6-d5**, that\u2019s the king moving to d5 \u2014 which"
