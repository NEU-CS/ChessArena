When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

King moves:\n- `c7d8`: King retreats to d8 \u2014 passive, loses central control.\n- `c7c8`: King to c8 \u2014 also retreats, allows Kc6.\n- `c7b8`: King to b8 \u2014 possibly preparing to attack b5? But then White plays Kc6, and b5-b6 may follow.\n- `c7d7`: King to d7 \u2014 central, active, supports e6 and f6, keeps eye on c6.\n- `c7b7`: King to b7 \u2014 **directly opposes the b5 pawn**, prevents b5-b6, and challenges the White king.\n\nWait \u2014 `c7b7` puts the Black king on b7, directly in front of the b5 pawn. This **blocks the pawn\u2019s advance** because b5-b6 would be met by ...Kxb6.\n\nMoreover, if White plays Kc5-c6, Black can play ...Kb7-c8, keeping the opposition.\n\nSo `c7b7` is **very strong** \u2014 it freezes the b-pawn and keeps the king active.\n\nCompare with:\n- `c7d7`: King moves away from the critical b-file. Then White plays Kc5-c6, and Black cannot take on b5 because of b5-b6+! winning the pawn back with tempo. For example:\n  - 1...Kd7 2. Kc6! Kc8 3. b6+ Kb8 4. Kd7, and the b-pawn is unstoppable.\n\nSo `c7d7` is **dangerous** \u2014 it allows Kc6 with a strong initiative.\n\nSimilarly:\n- `c7d8`, `c7c8`, `c7b8` \u2014 all allow Kc6, and White gains the opposition.\n\nOnly `c7b7` **prevents Kc6** because after 1...Kb7, if 2. Kc6? then ...Kxb6! and Black wins the pawn.\n\nSo `c7b7` **maintains the balance** and prevents White\u2019s plan.\n\n#### 2. Pawn moves:\n- `f6f5`: This weakens the kingside. It fixes the pawn on f5, and opens the e6 pawn to attack. Also, no urgency on the kingside. White can just continue with Kc5-c6 or b5-b6 if not stopped.\n- `e6e5`: Opens the center, but after f4-f5, the e5 pawn becomes weak. Also, no clear benefit. It may even block the king\u2019s path.\n\nThese pawn moves do **nothing to stop White\u2019s queenside threat** and are passive or weakening.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe **only move that prevents White\u2019s immediate plan of Kc6 and b6** is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **`c7b7`**\n\nThis move:\n- Blocks the b5 pawn.\n- Maintains the opposition.\n- Keeps the king active.\n- Prevents White from making progress.\n\nAll other king moves allow Kc6 with strong pressure.\n\nPawn moves are irrelevant or weakening.\n\n---\n\n### Best move:\n```\nc7b7\n```"
