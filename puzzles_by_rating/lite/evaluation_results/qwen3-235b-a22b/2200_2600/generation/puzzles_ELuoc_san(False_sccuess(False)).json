When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Wait \u2014 e1 is rook, but what about the other?\n    - Looking at 3rd rank: no rook. So only one rook on e1?\n    - But FEN says `4R1K1` on 1st rank \u2192 e1=R\n    - And no other R in FEN \u2192 so only one rook? But wait \u2014 on 4th rank: `5r2` \u2192 f4=r (black)\n    - So White has only one rook: e1\n  - Knights: c3, f3\n  - Bishops: c5, d3\n  - Queen: g3\n  - Pawns: a2, b2, g2, h3, and possibly others? a2, b2, g2, h3 \u2014 yes.\n\nWait \u2014 3rd rank: h3=P (White), so pawns on a2, b2, g2, h3.\n\n- **Black**:\n  - King: g8\n  - Rooks: e8, f4\n  - Queen: c7\n  - Bishops: d7\n  - Knights: e5\n  - Pawns: a6, b7, d5, h7, g6, a6\n\nWait \u2014 a6=p (black), b7=p, d5=p, g6=p, h7=p\n\nSo material is roughly equal, but there is **tension** in the center and **attack potential**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Threats and Tactical Opportunities**\n\nKey features:\n\n- **White has a queen on g3**, pointing at h7 and potentially g6.\n- **White bishop on c5** is attacking e7 and f8.\n- **Black has rooks on e8 and f4**, both active.\n- **Black queen on c7**, defending d7 and possibly e5.\n- **White knight on f3**, supports queen on g3.\n- **Black knight on e5**, central, but possibly vulnerable.\n- **White bishop on d3**, supports c5 and e4.\n- **White king on g1**, relatively safe for now.\n\nNow, **tactical motifs**:\n\n1. **Discovered attack potential** with moving bishop on c5.\n2. **Pin on e-file?** e-file has:\n   - e8: black rook\n   - e5: black knight\n   - e4: empty\n   - e3: empty\n   - e2: empty\n   - e1: white rook\n\nSo if the knight on e5 moves, rook on e8 is pinned to king? Not quite \u2014 king is on g8, so not on e-file.\n\nBut **White can play e1-e5**, attacking the knight on e5?\n\nWait \u2014 e1-e5 is a legal move (in the list: `e1e5`).\n\nBut e5 is occupied by black knight \u2014 so `e1e5` would **capture** the knight.\n\nIs that safe?\n\nLet\u2019s check: e1-e5: rook takes e5.\n\n- Black can recapture with d5-d4? No \u2014 d5 is a pawn, but it's on d5.\n- Or with f4-e4? f4 is black ro"
