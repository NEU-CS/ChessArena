When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Wait \u2014 no, `g7g6` is **Kg7-g6**? No \u2014 wait!\n\nWait \u2014 **notation clarification**:\n\nIn UCI, moves are given as **from-to squares**, regardless of piece.\n\nBut the move `g7g6` \u2014 that would be **pawn from g7 to g6**? But there's no pawn on g7.\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the board from FEN:\n\n```\n8/1p3kp1/p1p2p1p/2P2P2/1P1K4/7P/1P4P1/8\n```\n\nLet\u2019s break it down rank by rank (from 8th to 1st):\n\n- **8th rank**: `8` \u2192 empty\n- **7th rank**: `1p3kp1` \u2192 [1 empty, b7=pawn, 3 empty, Kf7, 1 empty] \u2192 so **king on f7**, **pawn on b7**\n- **6th rank**: `p1p2p1p` \u2192 a6=pawn, c6=pawn, f6=pawn, h6=pawn\n- **5th rank**: `2P2P2` \u2192 c5=pawn, f5=pawn\n- **4th rank**: `1P1K4` \u2192 b4=pawn, d4=king\n- **3rd rank**: `7P` \u2192 h3=pawn\n- **2nd rank**: `1P4P1` \u2192 b2=pawn, g2=pawn\n- **1st rank**: `8` \u2192 empty\n\nSo:\n- **Black king is on f7**, not g7. The `f7` square has the king.\n- So `f7g8` = Kf7-g8\n- `f7f8` = Kf7-f8\n- `f7e8` = Kf7-e8\n- `f7e7` = Kf7-e7\n- `g7g6` \u2192 but there is **no piece on g7** \u2014 wait, this must be a **pawn move**?\n\nWait \u2014 no pawn on g7. Let's double-check:\n\n6th rank: `p1p2p1p` \u2192 a6, c6, f6, h6 \u2014 so **no g7 pawn**.\n\nBut `g7g6` is listed as a legal move. That suggests a **pawn on g7**?\n\nWait \u2014 7th rank: `1p3kp1` \u2192 1 empty, b7=pawn, 3 empty, Kf7, 1 empty \u2192 so **g7 is empty**.\n\nSo how can `g7g6` be a legal move?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the move `g7g6` is **not** a pawn move \u2014 but a **king move**? But king is on f7.\n\nUnless the notation is wrong?\n\nWait \u2014 maybe I misread the FEN.\n\nLet me parse it again:\n\nFEN: `8/1p3kp1/p1p2p1p/2P2P2/1P1K4/7P/1P4P1/8`\n\n- Rank 8: `8` \u2192 8 empty\n- Rank 7: `1p3kp1` \u2192 1 empty, b7=pawn, 3 empty, Kf7, 1 empty \u2192 so **f7 = black king**\n- Rank 6: `p1p2p1p` \u2192 a6=pawn, c6=pawn, f6=pawn, h6=pawn\n- Rank 5: `2P2P2` \u2192 c5=white pawn, f5=white pawn\n- Rank 4: `1P1K4` \u2192 b4=white pawn, d4=white king\n- Rank 3: `7P` \u2192 h3=white pawn\n- Rank 2: `1P4P1` \u2192 b2=white pawn, g2=white pawn\n- Rank 1: `8` \u2192 empty\n\nSo:\n- Black king: f7\n- White king: d4\n\nNow, legal moves:\n- `f7g8` \u2014 Kf7-g8\n- `f7f8` \u2014 Kf7-f8\n- `f7e8` \u2014 Kf7-e8\n- `f7e7` \u2014 Kf7-e7\n- `g7g6` \u2014 ??? no piece on g7\n- `b7b6` \u2014 b7-b6\n- `h6h5` \u2014 h6-h5\n- `a6a5` \u2014 a6-a5\n- `g7g5` \u2014 g7-g5? Again, no g7 pawn\n- `b7b5` \u2014 b7-b5\n\nWait \u2014 `g7g6`, `g7g5` \u2014 these suggest a **pawn on g7**, but there is none.\n\nUnless the FEN is misread?\n\nWait \u2014 rank 7: `1p3kp1` \u2014 that's:\n- a7: empty\n- b7: pawn\n- c7: empty\n- d7: empty\n- e7: empty\n- f7: king\n- g7: empty\n- h7: pawn? No \u2014 `1p3kp1` \u2014 last `1` means one empty at end \u2192 so h7 is empty.\n\nSo **no pawn on g7**.\n\nBut `g7g6` and `g7g5` are listed as legal moves \u2014 that doesn't make sense.\n\nUnless it's a typo?\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps `g7g6` is meant to be **f7g6**? But that's not listed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe `g7g6` is a **pawn move from h7 to h6**? But that would be `h7h6`, not `g7g6`.\n\nWait \u2014 the move `h6h5` **is** listed \u2014 that makes sense: h6-h5.\n\nBut `g7g6` and `g7g5` \u2014 unless there's a pawn on g7, these are illegal.\n\nBut the FEN shows no pawn on g7.\n\nWait \u2014 rank 6: `p1p2p1p` \u2014 that's:\n- a6: pawn\n- b6: empty\n- c6: pawn\n- d6: empty\n- e6: empty\n- f6: pawn\n- g6: empty\n- h6: pawn\n\nSo no pawn on g7.\n\nSo why are `g7g6` and `g7g5` in the legal moves?\n\nPossibility: **typo in the move list**.\n\nAlternatively, maybe `g7g6` is meant to be **f7g6** \u2014 king from f7 to g6?\n\nBut that would be `f7g6`, not `g7g6`.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the move `g7g6` is actually **a pawn move from g7 to g6**, but there is no such pawn.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the FEN is:\n\n`8/1p3kp1/p1p2p1p/2P2P2/1P1"
