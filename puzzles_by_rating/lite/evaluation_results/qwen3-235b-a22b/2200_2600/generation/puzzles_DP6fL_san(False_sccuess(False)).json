FEN: 6/6/6/.../.../6/6/ \u2192 no, the FEN says:\n\nFEN: `8/p7/8/1p1K1kpp/1P6/6PP/P7/8`\n\nSo:\n- Rank 8: 8 \u2192 ........\n- Rank 7: p7 \u2192 p.......\n- Rank 6: 8 \u2192 ........\n- Rank 5: 1p1K1kpp \u2192 . p .

They are two files apart, same rank? No \u2014 d5 vs f5: two files apart, same rank (5th). So not directly opposing.\n\n- **Pawn structure**:\n  - White has pawns on b4, a2, g3, h3\n  - Black has pawns on a7, b5, g5, h5\n\n- **Critical pawn on b5**: Black has a pawn on b5, White has one on b4 \u2014 they are adjacent. This is a **mutual blockade** on the b-file.\n\n- **a-file**: Black has a7, White has a2. a7 is far advanced, but a2 is behind. However, a7 is isolated and may become a target.\n\n- **Kingside**: g5/h5 for Black, g3/h3 for White. Black pawns are on 5th rank, White on 3rd. So Black is more advanced.\n\n- **White king is deep in enemy territory** \u2014 on d5, very central.\n\n- **Black king on f5**, also central, but slightly more advanced.\n\n- **Critical idea**: White may try to **promote a pawn** or **break through**.\n\nBut White has no immediate passed pawn. However, **White king is very active**, while Black king is also active.\n\nBut look: **White to move**, and the **kings are close**.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **legal moves**:\n\n```\nd5d6, d5c6, d5c5, d5d4, h3h4, g3g4, a2a3, a2a4\n```\n\nSo only 8 legal moves.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Analyze candidate moves\n\n#### 1. **d5d6** \u2014 King to d6\n\n- King moves to d6, attacking c7, d7, e7, and supporting e6 push potentially.\n- But now the king is on d6, closer to the a7 pawn.\n- Is a7 vulnerable? Black has no pieces, so a7 pawn is weak.\n- But after Kd6, Black can play ...Kf6 or ...Kf4, centralizing.\n- Also, Kd6 might allow ...Kf6, then ...Kf7, and Black king can chase the White king away.\n- But more importantly: **is d6 safe?**\n\nAfter **1. Kd6**, Black plays **1... Kf6**, attacking the g5 pawn? No, g5 is defended by h5? No \u2014 g5 is on g5, h5 on h5 \u2014 they don\u2019t defend each other.\n\nWait \u2014 g5 and h5 are on same rank, not connected. So g5 is only defended by... no one? h5 is defended by g5? No \u2014 pawns defend diagonally.\n\ng5 pawn defends f4 and h4.\nh5 pawn defends g4.\n\nSo g5 is **not defended** by any Black pawn. Similarly, h5 is defended by g5? No \u2014 g5 is on g5, so it can defend f4 and h4 \u2014 not h5.\n\nSo **g5 is undefended**? Wait \u2014 no piece is on f6 or h6 to defend g5. So yes, **g5 pawn is hanging**?\n\nWait \u2014 after **1. Kd6**, can White **capture g5**?\n\nNo \u2014 king on d6 is far from g5.\n\nBut after **1. Kd6 Kf6**, then White can play **2. Kxg5**?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- After 1. Kd6 Kf6\n- 2. Kxg5? \u2014 king from d6 to g5? That\u2019s d6 \u2192 e6 \u2192 f6 \u2192 g5? No, king moves one square at a time.\n\nd6 to g5 is 3 files and 1 rank \u2014 too far. Not possible.\n\nSo Kd6 doesn't attack g5.\n\nBut what about **Kd6, then Kc7**, going after a7?\n\nYes \u2014 that\u2019s a plan: **invade via c7 to capture a7**.\n\nAfter Kd6, next Kc7, then Kb7, winning the a7 pawn.\n\nBut Black can try to stop it.\n\nAfter 1. Kd6, Black can play 1... Ke4! \u2014 going to the center, threatening to attack White\u2019s pawns or support ...g4.\n\nOr 1... a6, preventing Kb6 later.\n\nBut let\u2019s see:\n\n- 1. Kd6 Kf6\n- 2. Kc7 Ke6\n- 3. Kb7 Kd7\n- 4. Kxa7 Kc7\n\nNow White has a7 pawn, but king is on a7, and Black king is on c7 \u2014 very close.\n\nThen White can try to push b4, but b5 is in the way.\n\nBut White has b4 pawn, Black b5.\n\nSo after capturing a7, White is not necessarily winning \u2014 Black may blockade.\n\nBut at least White is making progress.\n\nBut is there a better move?\n\n#### 2. **d5c6** \u2014 King to c6\n\n- Attacks b5 and d5, and heads toward a7.\n- From c6, can go to c7, then b7.\n- But after Kc6, Black can play ...Kf6, same as before.\n- Also, Kc6 attacks b5 \u2014 so **threatens to capture b5**?\n- b5 is defended by a7? Yes \u2014 a7 pawn defends b6, but b5 is on b5 \u2014 a7 is on a7,"

No captures yet.\n\n**Key features:**\n- Kings are active. White king is on c6, central and advanced.\n- Black king is on f5, also quite active.\n- Pawn structure:\n  - On the queenside: White has pawns on a2 and b4; Black has a7 and b5.\n    - The b4 pawn is advanced, but may be weak.\n    - a7 is a potential passer if supported.\n  - On the kingside: White has pawns on g3, h3; Black has g4 and h5.\n    - Black has just played g5-g4 (given in move history), advancing the g-pawn.\n    - So g4 is now a passed pawn? No \u2014 White has pawns on g3 and h3, so:\n      - g-file: White g3, Black g4 \u2192 Black has a pawn on g4, White on g3 \u2192 Black is one step ahead.\n      - h-file: White h3, Black h5 \u2192 Black is two steps ahead.\n\nBut note: **g4 is a black pawn on g4**, and White has a pawn on g3 \u2014 so they are adjacent.\n\nWait: **g4 is occupied by a black pawn**, and White has pawns on g3 and h3.\n\nSo after **g5-g4**, Black has a pawn on g4, attacking h3? No \u2014 pawns capture diagonally. g4 pawn attacks f3 and h3.\n\nBut h3 is occupied by a White pawn \u2014 so **g4 attacks h3**.\n\nSimilarly, White\u2019s g3 pawn attacks f4 and h4.\n\nSo **tension exists on the kingside**.\n\nNow, **White\u2019s legal moves**:\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each:\n\n### King moves:\n- `c6d7`: Kc6-d7 \u2014 into the center, towards the a7 pawn?\n- `c6c7`: Kc6-c7 \u2014 attacks a7, supports b4?\n- `c6b7`: Kc6-b7 \u2014 captures a7? No \u2014 a7 is occupied by black pawn. b7 is empty. So Kb7 would be near a7.\n- `c6d6`: Kd6 \u2014 central, towards e-file?\n- `c6d5`: Kd5 \u2014 towards center, near black king?\n- `c6c5`: Kc5 \u2014 attacking b5 and d5, supporting b4?\n- `c6b5`: Kxb5 \u2014 **capture** of black pawn on b5?\n\nWait \u2014 is b5 occupied by a black pawn? Yes, from FEN: 5th rank: `1p3k1p` \u2192 b5 is black pawn.\n\nSo **c6b5** is a **capture** \u2014 White king takes the b5 pawn.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\nLet\u2019s check: After **Kxb5**, Black can play **Kf5-e6**, forking or attacking?\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\nAfter **1. Kxb5**, Black plays **1... Ke6**, attacking the White king on b5 and also threatening to march toward the queenside pawns.\n\nBut White can respond with **Kc6**, retreating.\n\nBut more importantly: is **Kxb5** safe from immediate retaliation?\n\nBlack\u2019s king is on f5. After Kxb5, Black\u2019s king is two squares away. No immediate check or capture.\n\nBut what about the **a7 pawn**? After Kxb5, Black can play **a7-a5** or **a7-a6**, but that\u2019s slow.\n\nBut White might be able to take a7 next.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider **if b5 is defended**.\n\nIs the b5 pawn defended?\n\nBlack has:\n- a7 pawn \u2014 could potentially support b5?\n- But a7 pawn is on a7, so it attacks b6 \u2014 not b5.\n- b5 pawn is on b5 \u2014 it is attacked by no black piece. Only by White king.\n\nSo **b5 pawn is undefended**.\n\nTherefore, **Kxb5 is a free pawn capture**.\n\nBut we must check **if it leads to a better position**.\n\nBut also: **after Kxb5, can Black counterattack?**\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAfter **1. Kxb5**, Black plays **1... Ke6**, aiming for d5 or c6.\n\nThen White can play **Kc6**, and now:\n\n- White king is on c6, Black king on e6.\n- White has pawns on a2, b4, g3, h3.\n- Black has pawns on a7, h5, g4.\n\nNow, White can play **Kc7**, threatening a7.\n\nBlack must respond: **a7-a5** or **a7-a6**.\n\nSay **a7-a5**, then **b4xa5**, and White has a protected passer on a5.\n\nBut Black might play **Ke6-d5**, trying to stop.\n\nBut White king can go back.\n\nAlternatively, after **Kxb5**, White may not even need to retreat \u2014 can play **Kc5**, supporting b4.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider **other options**.\n\n### Kingside pawn moves:\n- `h3g4`: h3xg4 \u2014 capture on g4\n- `h3h4`: h4 \u2014 advancing\n\nLet\u2019s analyze **h3g4**:\n\n- Captures the g4 pawn.\n- After **hxg4**, the g-file is cleared. Now White has pawns on g3 and g4? No: h3 captures on g4, so:\n  - h3 pawn moves to g4.\n  - So now White has pawns on g3 and g4 \u2014 connected passed pawns?\n  - Black has pawn on h5.\n\nAfter **hxg4**, Black can play **h5xg4**, capturing.\n\nThen White plays **g3xg4**, recapturing.\n\nSo the line:\n1. hxg4 hxg4\n2. gxg4\n\nNow White has a pawn on g4, Black has no pawns on g or h except possibly h5 is gone.\n\nWait: h5 was on h5, captured g4? No \u2014 h5 captures on g4 only if it's diagonal.\n\nh5 pawn captures on g4 \u2014 yes, because h5 to g4 is diagonal.\n\nSo yes: **h5xg4** is legal.\n\nSo after:\n- 1. h3g4 (hxg4)\n- 1... h5xg4\n- 2. g3xg4\n\nNow White has a pawn on g4, Black has no pawns on kingside.\n\nBut Black king is on f5 \u2014 can it attack g4?\n\nKf5-e5, then Kd5, etc., but White king is active.\n\nBut now White has a potential passer on g4.\n\nBut is this better than capturing on b5?\n\nAlternatively, **h3h4** \u2014 prevents ...g4-g3? But g4 is already on g4.\n\ng4 pawn is on g4, so it"
