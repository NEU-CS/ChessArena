If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n2k5/2P1R3/6p1/5p2/2b5/3p2P1/5P1P/6K1 w - - 0 42\n```\n\nThis means:\n- White to move\n- White has a rook on e7, a pawn on c7, pawns on g3, f2, h2\n- Black has a king on c8, bishop on c4, pawn on g6, f5, d3\n- No castling rights, no en passant\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the position:\n\n```\n8:  -  -  k  -  -  -  -  -\n7:  -  -  P  -  R  -  -  -\n6:  -  -  -  -  -  -  p  -\n5:  -  -  -  -  -  p  -  -\n4:  -  -  b  -  -  -  -  -\n3:  -  -  -  p  -  -  P  -\n2:  -  -  -  -  -  P  -  P\n1:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  K\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWhite pieces:\n- King: g1\n- Rook: e7\n- Pawns: c7, g3, f2, h2\n\nBlack pieces:\n- King: c8\n- Bishop: c4\n- Pawns: g6, f5, d3\n\n### Goal: Find the best move from the legal moves list:\n\nLegal moves:\n- e7e8, e7h7, e7g7, e7f7, e7d7, e7e6, e7e5, e7e4, e7e3, e7e2, e7e1\n- g1g2, g1h1, g1f1\n- g3g4, h2h3, f2f3, h2h4, f2f4\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate the position\n\nWhite has a **very strong threat**: the pawn on c7 is one square away from queening. The rook on e7 is guarding it. If c7 promotes, it's likely game over for Black.\n\nBut: **c7-c8=Q??** is not possible yet because the c8 square is occupied by the black king.\n\nSo, can White force a promotion?\n\nWait \u2014 the rook is on e7. Can it help support the c7 pawn?\n\nc7 is on the 7th rank, same as the rook. But the rook cannot directly defend the pawn's promotion unless it moves to c7 or supports from behind.\n\nBut the key idea: **Can White force the promotion of the c-pawn?**\n\nCurrently, the black king is on c8, blocking c8. So to promote, White must either:\n- Force the black king away from c8\n- Deliver checkmate\n- Or promote with check\n\nLet\u2019s look at **e7e8+** \u2014 that\u2019s a rook move from e7 to e8.\n\nAfter **e7e8**, the rook moves to e8, giving **check** to the black king on c8 (along the 8th rank).\n\nLet\u2019s analyze **e7e8+**:\n\n- Rook moves to e8, attacking along the 8th rank.\n- Black king on c8 is in check from the rook on e8.\n- Where can the king go?\n\nFrom c8, legal king moves under check:\n- c7? \u2014 c7 has a white pawn \u2192 illegal\n- d7? \u2014 is d7 attacked? No piece attacks d7. But is it occupied? No \u2014 d7 is empty.\n- b7? \u2014 b7 is empty, no attack? Let's see.\n\nAfter **1. e7e8=Q+?** \u2014 wait, rook move, not pawn. It's **e7e8**, just rook to e8, giving check.\n\nSo: **1. Re8+**\n\nBlack king on c8 is in check from rook on e8.\n\nKing escape squares:\n- c7 \u2014 occupied by white pawn (c7) \u2192 no\n- d7 \u2014 empty. Is it attacked? Black bishop on c4 does not attack d7. White has no piece attacking d7. So d7 is safe?\n- b8 \u2014 empty. Is it attacked? No.\n- b7 \u2014 empty. Is it attacked? No.\n- c8 is current square, under attack.\n\nSo possible king moves: **Kd7, Kb8, Kb7**\n\nBut wait \u2014 **b8 and b7**: are they safe?\n\nWhite has a pawn on c7. That pawn attacks **b8** and **d8**.\n\nSo:\n- b8 is attacked by c7 pawn \u2192 king cannot go to b8\n- d8 is attacked by c7 pawn \u2192 but d8 is occupied by rook now? No \u2014 rook is on e8.\n\nAfter Re8+, d8 is empty? No \u2014 the rook was on e7, moving to e8. d8 is empty.\n\nBut c7 pawn attacks b8 and d8.\n\nSo:\n- Kb8? \u2192 b8 is attacked by c7 pawn \u2192 illegal\n- Kd8? \u2192 d8 is attacked by c7 pawn \u2192 illegal\n- Kd7? \u2192 d7 is not attacked by anything. Is it empty? Yes.\n- Kb7? \u2192 b7 is not attacked? c7 pawn attacks b8 and d8, not b7. So b7 is safe?\n\nWait: pawn on c7 (white) attacks b8 and d8 \u2014 only forward diagonals. So b7 is **not** attacked.\n\nSo possible king escapes:\n- Kd7\n- Kb7\n\nBoth seem possible.\n\nSo after **1. Re8+**, Black plays **Kd7** or **Kb7**, and the game continues.\n\nBut now, what happens?\n\nIf **1... Kd7**, then White can play **2. c8=Q+**, promoting with check!\n\nBecause after Kd7, c8 is free, and promoting to queen gives check.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n1. Re8+ Kd7  \n2. c8=Q+\n\nNow Black is in check from the queen on c8.\n\nKing on d7:\n- Can it go to d6? Possibly.\n- c7? occupied by nothing now? c7 was pawn, now promoted \u2014 so c7 is empty? No \u2014 the pawn was on c7, moves to c8, so c7 is empty.\n\nBut queen on c8 attacks d7? Yes \u2014 diagonal. So king on d7 is in check from queen on c8.\n\nSo **2. c8=Q+** is check.\n\nKing on d7 must move:\n- d6? \u2014 is it attacked? Queen on c8 attacks d7 and b7, but not d6 directly. But is it safe?\n- e7? \u2014 e7 is empty? After Re8, e7 is empty. But is e7 attacked? Black bishop on c4 doesn't attack e7. So e7 might be safe.\n- e6? etc.\n\nBut more importantly: **after 2. c8=Q+, Black is in check, and White has a queen now.**\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **1. Re8+** actually winning?\n\nLet\u2019s go back.\n\nAfter **1. Re8+**, Black has another option: **1... Kb7**\n\nThen White plays **2. c8=Q+**, queen promotion with check.\n\nKing on b7:\n- Where can it go?\n- b6? \u2014 possible\n- c7? \u2014 c7 has nothing? After promotion, c7 is empty. But queen on c8 attacks c7? Yes \u2014 same file. So c7 is attacked.\n- a7? \u2014 is it attacked? Queen on c8 attacks b7 and a8? a8 is diagonal, but a7 is not.\n\nQueen on c8 attacks:\n- along c-file: c7, c6...\n- along 8th rank: b8, a8\n- diagonal: b7, d7, etc.\n\nSo b7 is attacked by queen on c8.\n\nSo after **2. c8=Q+**, king on b7 is in check.\n\nEscape:\n- b6? \u2014 not attacked? Queen doesn't attack b6. Is it safe?\n- a7? \u2014 not attacked? Queen on c8 attacks b7 and a8, but not a7. So a7 is safe?\n- a6? etc.\n\nBut **b6** might be safe.\n\nSo Black can escape.\n\nBut White has a queen now, and Black has only a bishop and pawns. So White is winning.\n\nBut is there a **faster win**?\n\nWait \u2014 what if instead of Re8+, White plays **c8=Q** directly? But c8 is occupied by black king \u2014 impossible.\n\nSo Re8+ forces the king to move, then c8 is free.\n\nBut after Re8+, king can go to d7 or b7, and then c8=Q+ wins material.\n\nBut is there a **checkmate** possibility?\n\nLet\u2019s consider: after **1. Re8+ Kd7 2. c8=Q+ Ke7??** \u2014 but Ke7 is into queen check? Queen on c8 attacks d7,"
