When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

K . . . . .\n3 | . p . . . . . .\n2 | P . P . . . . .\n1 | . . . . . . . .\n    a b c d e f g h\n```\n\nWhite: King on c4, pawns on a2, b3, c2  \nBlack: King on e5, pawns on a7, b6, c6\n\n### Goal:\nWhite is trying to promote a pawn or restrict Black to force a win. Black is trying to stop White\u2019s pawns and possibly use their own pawns.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- The position is very closed. Black has a strong pawn chain on b6/c6/a7.\n- White\u2019s king is on c4 \u2014 central and active.\n- Black\u2019s king is on e5 \u2014 also central, but perhaps a bit exposed.\n- White\u2019s pawns: a2, b3, c2 \u2014 all on second rank. They are not advanced.\n- Black\u2019s pawns: a7, b6, c6 \u2014 forming a solid structure.\n\nBut note: **White has a significant advantage in king activity**. The White king is closer to the center and can support pawn advances.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move:\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n1. **c4b4** \u2014 King to b4  \n2. **c4d3** \u2014 King to d3  \n3. **c4c3** \u2014 King to c3  \n4. **b3b4** \u2014 Pawn push b3-b4  \n5. **c2c3** \u2014 Pawn to c3  \n6. **a2a3** \u2014 Pawn to a3  \n7. **a2a4** \u2014 Pawn to a4\n\n---\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. **c4b4** \u2014 King to b4\n\n- King moves toward the queenside.\n- Now attacks a5 and c5, supports b5 push.\n- But Black can respond with ...Kd6 or ...Kd4, challenging.\n- However, this brings the king closer to the b-pawn, which might be useful.\n- But after Kb4, Black can play ...Kd6, and if c4 is left weak, maybe ...Kc6 later.\n- Not clearly better than other king moves.\n\n#### 2. **c4d3** \u2014 King to d3\n\n- Centralizing the king.\n- Now king is on d3, supporting e4 push (if possible), and also supporting c4-c5 later.\n- Also defends c2 pawn indirectly.\n- From d3, king can go to e4, supporting d5 or e5.\n- But e5 is occupied by Black king.\n- Still, this is a flexible central square.\n\n#### 3. **c4c3** \u2014 King to c3\n\n- King moves to c3, supporting b4 and d4.\n- Defends b3 pawn.\n- But c3 is less central than d3.\n- From c3, king can go to b4 or d4.\n- But it blocks the c2 pawn from advancing to c3.\n- Also, if Black plays ...Kd4, then Kc3 is in opposition? Not quite \u2014 it's adjacent.\n\nWait: after **Kc3**, if Black plays ...Kd4, then White is in zugzwang? Let's see:\n\n- Kc3, Kd4 \u2014 now White must move. King can go to c2, b3, d3, c4.\n- But if Kc4, Black can play ...Kc4? No, because c4 is attacked by White king only if vacated.\n- Actually, after Kc3 Kd4, White can play Kd2, for example.\n\nBut more importantly: **c4c3** blocks the c2 pawn from advancing. That seems bad.\n\nc2 pawn is a potential passer if supported. So blocking it may not be ideal.\n\n#### 4. **b3b4** \u2014 Push b3-b4\n\n- Creates a pawn chain: a2, b4, c2\n- But now the c2 pawn is backward.\n- Also, after b4, Black can play ...c5!?\n  - c6-c5, opening the position.\n  - After c5, if bxc5, bxc5, then doubled pawns, but open c-file.\n  - But White has no rook.\n- More importantly: ...c5 would challenge the center.\n- Also, after b4, Black can play ...Kd4, attacking c2 and b4.\n  - Then White must defend: Kc3 or Kd3.\n- So b4 might be premature \u2014 it weakens c3 and may allow ...Kd4 with pressure.\n\n#### 5. **c2c3** \u2014 Pawn to c3\n\n- Solidifies the center.\n- Supports d4 push later.\n- Connects pawns: b3 and c3 are linked.\n- Prevents ...Kd4, because d4 is now attacked by c3 pawn.\n- This is key: **after c2c3, Black cannot play ...Kd4**, because d4 is controlled.\n- Also, prepares Kd3 or Kc3, with king supporting e4 or d4.\n- Also, if Black plays ...Kd6, White can play Kd4, gaining opposition.\n- This move gains space and restricts the Black king.\n\nThis looks promising.\n\n#### 6. **a2a3** \u2014 Pawn to a3\n\n- A waiting move? Not really.\n- Prevents ...b5? But b5 is already blocked by b3.\n- Doesn\u2019t contribute to advancement.\n- Loses a tempo.\n- Not useful.\n\n#### 7. **a2a4** \u2014 Pawn to a4\n\n- Opens the a-file? Not really.\n- Might prepare a5 later, but a5 is hard to support.\n- After a4, Black plays ...Kd4, and White is not better.\n- Also, a4 weakens b4 \u2014 Black might play ...b5 later.\n- Risky and not necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Comparing Key Candidates:\n\n- **c2c3** stands out: it prevents ...Kd4, strengthens the pawn center, and prepares king centralization.\n- After c2c3, White can follow up with Kd3 or Kc3, aiming for Kd4, gaining opposition.\n- It also supports a future d4 push if needed.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n**1. c2c3**  \nNow Black must respond.\n\nBlack\u2019s king on e5. Options:  \n- ...Kd6 \u2014 then White plays Kd4! (opposition), and Black is in zugzwang.  \n  - If ...Kc6, White plays Kc4, and now Black must move a pawn or king.  \n  - a7-a6? Then b3-b4, and White gains space.  \n- ...Kf5 \u2014 then Kd3, Ke5, Kd4 \u2014 again, White gains central control.  \n- ...Kd5 \u2014 same, Kd3, then Kd4 next.\n\nAfter c2c3, White can aim for Kd3-d4, achieving the distant opposition.\n\nCompare with **c4d3** \u2014 also good, but after Kd3, Black might play ...Kd5, and if c2-c3?, then Kd4 is possible for Black.\n\nBut if White plays **c2c3 first**, then Kd3, it\u2019s stronger.\n\nWait: is **c2c3** safe?\n\nAfter c2c3, is there any tactical issue?\n\nBlack plays ...Kd4? No \u2014 d4 is attacked by c3 pawn. So ...Kd4 is illegal.\n\nSo **c2c3** immediately removes ...Kd4 as a threat.\n\nThat\u2019s a big plus.\n\nNow, after c2c3, White can play Kd3 next, and if ...Kd5, then Kd3! (opposition), and Black is in zugzwang.\n\nAlternatively, White can play Kc3, supporting b4.\n\nBut **c2c3** is a prophylactic move \u2014 it prevents counterplay.\n\nNow, what about **c4d3**?\n\nKd3 is also good, but after Kd3, Black can play ...Kd5, and if White plays c2c3?, then ...Kd4! is possible \u2014 and now White king is on d3, so Kd4 is attacked.\n\nAfter:\n\n1. Kd3 Kd5  \n2. c2c3? Kd4! \u2014 and now White must move king, losing ground.\n\nSo playing **c2c3** first, while king is on c4, avoids that.\n\nHence, **c2c3** is better than Kd3 followed by c2c3.\n\nSimilarly,"
