        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/4k1pp/P7/1n6/1PK5/8/8/8 b - - 2 49\n```\n\nThis means:\n- Black to move (since it's `b` in the FEN)\n- Black king on e7\n- White king on c4\n- White pawn on a6\n- Black knight on b5\n- Black pawns on g7 and h7\n- No castling rights\n- No en passant\n- Move count: 49 (Black's 49th move)\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Material Count**\n- White: King + pawn on a6\n- Black: King + knight on b5 + pawns on g7, h7\n\nWhite\u2019s pawn on a6 is very advanced and close to queening. Black must prevent it from promoting.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Threat: a6-a7-a8=Q**\nWhite\u2019s pawn on a6 is one square away from a7 and two from queening. If Black doesn\u2019t stop it, White will promote and likely win.\n\nBut it\u2019s **Black\u2019s move**, so Black can try to prevent this.\n\nWhite king is on c4 \u2014 relatively close to support the pawn, but not immediately.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluate Black\u2019s Options**\n\nWe need to stop the a6 pawn from promoting. Let\u2019s see how.\n\n#### **Can Black\u2019s king stop the pawn?**\nBlack king is on e7. It would take:\n- e7 \u2192 d6 \u2192 c7 \u2192 b7 \u2192 a7: 4 moves\nBut White can play a6-a7 in one move, then a7-a8=Q next move.\n\nSo king alone is too slow.\n\n#### **Can Black\u2019s knight stop the pawn?**\nKnight on b5.\n\nFrom b5:\n- Can it reach a7? a7 is a light square. Knight on b5 (dark square) moves to light squares.\n  - b5 \u2192 a7? Yes! That\u2019s a knight move.\n\nSo **b5a7** attacks a7 \u2014 if White plays a7, Black can capture on a7 with the knight.\n\nBut wait: if White plays a6-a7, Black can play ...Na7, but only if the knight is still on b5.\n\nBut if Black plays **b5a7** now, then:\n- Knight goes to a7\n- Then White plays a6-a7, attacking the knight\n- Then White recaptures with king or the knight runs\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s simulate:\n\n1. ... Na7??\n2. a7! Ne8 (or Nc8)\n3. a8=Q and White is winning\n\nSo just going to a7 doesn\u2019t help \u2014 the knight gets kicked and pawn promotes.\n\nBetter idea: **Knight to d6**?\n\n- Nd6 attacks c8 and b7 \u2014 both key squares for the a6 pawn.\n- If knight is on d6, then after a7, Black plays ...Nc8, blocking the pawn!\n  - a7 \u2192 Nc8\n  - Now the pawn is blocked on a7, and can\u2019t promote.\n\nThat\u2019s critical.\n\nSo **b5d6** is a candidate.\n\nLet\u2019s check if it\u2019s legal: yes, b5d6 is in the legal moves list.\n\nNow, after **...Nd6**, White plays a7, then ...Nc8, and the pawn is stuck.\n\nWhite king is on c4 \u2014 can it support? c4 to b5 to a6 \u2014 but if Black keeps the knight on c8, and king nearby, it might hold.\n\nBut Black also has pawns on h7 and g7 \u2014 not a problem yet.\n\nAlternatively, can the knight go to **c7**?\n\nb5c7: from b5 to c7 \u2014 that\u2019s a knight move.\n\nFrom c7, knight attacks b5, d5, a8, b8, d8, a6.\n\nWait \u2014 **a6**! So Nc7 attacks a6.\n\nSo if Black plays **...Nc7**, then the knight **attacks the pawn on a6 directly**.\n\nIf White doesn\u2019t move the pawn, Black captures on a6: Nc7xa6.\n\nThat wins the pawn!\n\nSo let\u2019s analyze:\n\n### **Candidate move: b5c7**\n\n1. ... Nc7!\n   - Attacks a6\n2. If White plays a7??, then ...Nxa6 \u2014 Black wins the pawn.\n   - But a7 is not forced.\n\nWhat can White do?\n\nAfter ...Nc7, White must deal with the threat of ...Nxa6.\n\nOptions:\n- a7: then ...Nxa7! (capturing the pawn)\n  - Now pawn is gone, and knight is on a7\n  - White king can go to b5, but knight is safe on a7 for now\n  - But Black is up material? No \u2014 knight for pawn, but now no immediate promotion threat\n  - Black can consolidate\n\nBut better for White: **move the king**?\n\nBut White is in **zugzwang** almost.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAfter 1... Nc7, White must prevent ...Nxa6.\n\nOnly ways:\n- a7: then ...Nxa7 \u2014 knight captures\n- Or do nothing \u2014 but then ...Nxa6 next move\n\nSo either:\n- a7 Nxa7\n- Or ...Nxa6\n\nIn both cases, the a6 pawn is gone.\n\nSo **...Nc7 wins the pawn**.\n\nIs that accurate?\n\nWait: after ...Nc7, if White plays a7, then ...Nxa7 \u2014 yes.\n\nBut after ...Nxa7, the pawn promotes? No \u2014 the pawn is on a7, knight captures on a7 \u2014 so the pawn is captured.\n\nWait: no \u2014 when White plays a7, the pawn moves to a7. Then Black plays ...Nc7xa7 \u2014 captures the pawn on a7.\n\nSo the pawn is captured \u2014 no promotion.\n\nSo Black wins the pawn.\n\nThen it\u2019s a knight vs king endgame with two pawns vs nothing \u2014 but Black has g7 and h7 pawns.\n\nAfter winning the pawn, Black can push his own pawns.\n\nBut let\u2019s see if White can promote anyway.\n\nNo \u2014 the pawn is gone.\n\nSo **...Nc7 wins the a6 pawn for free**?\n\nWait \u2014 is there a refutation?\n\nWhat if after ...Nc7, White plays **Kb5**?\n\nThen:\n- Black can play ...Nxa6+!\n  - Knight captures pawn, checks king\n- Kb5 must move \u2014 Kc5 or Kb4\n- Then knight is safe, and Black is up a pawn\n\nYes \u2014 so even if White tries Kb5, Black captures with check.\n\nSo **...Nc7 wins the pawn with advantage**.\n\nAlternatively, if White does nothing, ...Nxa6.\n\nSo **...Nc7 is winning**.\n\nNow compare to **...Nd6**\n\nNd6 is also good \u2014 prepares ...Nc8 to block a7.\n\nBut after ...Nd6, White can play **a7**, then Black plays ...Nc8.\n\nNow pawn is on a7, knight on c8.\n\nCan White make progress?\n\nKing on c4, can go Kb5, Ka6, etc.\n\nBut Black king can come to b8 or c7.\n\nBut it\u2019s more complicated \u2014 and White might still try to win.\n\nBut with ...Nc7, Black **wins the pawn immediately** \u2014 much simpler and better.\n\nSo why would we prefer ...Nd6 over ...Nc7?\n\nOnly if ...Nc7 is somehow bad.\n\nIs the knight on c7 hanging?\n\nNo \u2014 no piece attacks c7.\n\nb5 to c7 is safe.\n\nSo **...Nc7 wins a free pawn**.\n\nNow, let\u2019s check other options.\n\nWhat about king moves?\n\ne7f8, e7e8, e7d8, etc. \u2014 all king moves away from center.\n\nBut they don\u2019t stop the pawn.\n\nFor example, if Black plays ...Kf8, then White plays a7, then a8=Q \u2014 and White wins.\n\nSo king moves are losing.\n\nSimilarly, ...g7g6 or ...h7h6 \u2014 useless pawn moves \u2014 White plays a7 and promotes.\n\nSo those are losing.\n\nSo only meaningful moves are knight moves that deal with a6.\n\nNow, **b5a7**? As we saw, Na7? a7! and pawn promotes.\n\n**b5d4**, **b5c3**, etc. \u2014 knight moving away \u2014 White plays a7 and promotes.\n\nSo only **b5c7** and **b5d6** are serious.\n\nWe already saw **b5c7** wins the pawn.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **b5c7** really safe?\n\nAfter ...Nc7, can White play a7 and then a8=Q?\n\nNo \u2014 because after ...Nc7, if White plays a7, Black plays ...Nxa7 \u2014 capturing the pawn before it promotes.\n\nThe pawn is on a7, knight captures it \u2014 no promotion.\n\nSo yes, Black wins the pawn.\n\nAlternatively, if White doesn\u2019t play a7, Black plays ...Nxa6 next move.\n\nSo White cannot prevent losing the pawn.\n\nTherefore, **...Nc7 wins a full pawn** and eliminates the promotion threat.\n\nNow, after winning the pawn, Black has two pawns on g7 and h7, king in center, knight active.\n\nWhite has no pawns.\n\nSo Black should win the endgame.\n\nNow, what about **b5d6**?\n\nAs said, prepares ...Nc8 to block a7"
