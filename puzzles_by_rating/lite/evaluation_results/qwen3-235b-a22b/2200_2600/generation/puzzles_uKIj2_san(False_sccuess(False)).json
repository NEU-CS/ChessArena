When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\nrn2k2r/pb2ppbp/1p1p2p1/3n2B1/q1NP4/1N1B3P/P1Q2PP1/R4RK1 b kq - 5 17\n```\n\nThis means:\n- It's **Black's turn** to move (the `b` in the FEN).\n- Black has **kingside and queenside castling rights** (`kq`).\n- No en passant target square (`-`).\n- Halfmove clock is 5, fullmove 17.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Position**\n\n**Material:**\n- Both sides have all major pieces.\n- White has a slight lead in development and central control.\n- Black has a somewhat exposed queen on a4, but it's attacking c2 and potentially threatening tactics.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n- **Black's Queen on a4** is attacking White's queen on c2 and is also near b3 and c4.\n- **White's knight on c4** is attacking d6 and potentially threatening forks.\n- **White's bishop on g5** is pinning the knight on f6? Wait \u2014 there is **no knight on f6**, but there **is a knight on d5**. The bishop on g5 is on g5, so it's **not** pinning anything directly.\n- But wait: **Black has a bishop on g7**, so the g-file is open, and the white bishop on g5 is attacking along the g-file toward the black king.\n\nBut the black king is still on e8, and **Black can castle**.\n\n- **Black's queen on a4** is **attacking c2**, where White\u2019s queen is. But c2 is defended by White\u2019s queen herself and possibly others?\n\nLet\u2019s check:  \nWhite\u2019s queen on c2 \u2014 is it defended?\n\n- c2 is defended by:  \n  - The rook on a1? No, a1 is empty.  \n  - The knight on b3? No, knight is on b3? Wait \u2014 **White knight is on b3?** Let's reconstruct.\n\nWait \u2014 the position:\n\n```\nrn2k2r/pb2ppbp/1p1p2p1/3n2B1/q1NP4/1N1B3P/P1Q2PP1/R4RK1\n```\n\nLet\u2019s break it down by rank:\n\n- **Rank 8**: r n _ _ k _ _ r  \u2192 Black rooks on a8, h8; knight on b8; king on e8; missing c8, d8, f8, g8\n- **Rank 7**: p b _ _ e p p b p \u2192 a7, b7, e7, f7, g7, h7: pawns; b7 and g7 have bishops\n- **Rank 6**: _ p _ p _ _ g _ \u2192 b6, d6, g6: pawns\n- **Rank 5**: _ _ _ n _ _ B _ \u2192 d5: black knight; g5: white bishop\n- **Rank 4**: q _ N P _ _ _ _ \u2192 a4: black queen; c4: white knight; d4: white pawn\n- **Rank 3**: _ N _ B _ _ _ P \u2192 b3: white knight; d3: white bishop; h3: white pawn\n- **Rank 2**: P _ Q _ _ P P _ \u2192 a2, c2 (queen), f2, g2: pawns\n- **Rank 1**: R _ _ _ _ R K _ \u2192 a1, f1, g1: rook, rook, king\n\nSo:\n\n- White pieces:\n  - King: g1\n  - Rooks: a1, f1\n  - Queen: c2\n  - Knights: c4, b3\n  - Bishops: g5, d3\n  - Pawns: a2, d4, h3, f2, g2, c4? Wait: d4 is a pawn, c4 is knight. Pawns: a2, d4, f2, g2, h3, and d3 is bishop, so no pawn on d3.\n\nWait: d4 is a **white pawn**, c4 is **white knight**, so the c-pawn is gone.\n\nBlack:\n- King: e8\n- Queen: a4\n- Rooks: a8, h8\n- Knights: b8, d5\n- Bishops: b7, g7\n- Pawns: a7, b6, d6, e7, f7, g6, h7\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Evaluate Threats and Tactical Possibilities**\n\n#### **Black's Queen on a4**\n- Attacks c2 (White queen)\n- c2 is defended only by the queen herself? Is anything else defending c2?\n  - a2 pawn? No, a2 is pawn but doesn't defend c2.\n  - b3 knight? b3 knight defends c2? b3 to c2 is one square diagonally \u2014 yes! b3 knight **does** defend c2.\n  - So c2 is defended by b3 knight.\n\nSo **a4 attacks c2, but c2 is defended by b3 knight**. So **no immediate capture**.\n\nBut if Black can **deflect** or **remove** the b3 knight, or **pin** it, then c2 becomes vulnerable.\n\nCan we **pin the knight on b3**?\n\n- The knight on b3 is on b3. Can we attack it along a diagonal with a piece that would also attack something behind it?\n\nBlack has:\n- Bishop on b7 \u2014 it\u2019s on b7, which is diagonal to a6, c6, d5, etc.\n- b7 bishop attacks along a6\u2013g1 diagonal.\n\nDoes it attack b3? b7 to b3 is vertical \u2014 no. Diagonally? b7 to b3 is same file \u2014 no, it's straight down the b-file.\n\nWait: b7 is light-squared bishop? b7 is a dark square. b7 to a6 is light square? Let's see:\n\n- b7: dark square\n- a6: light\n- c6: light\n- d5: dark\n- e4: light\n- f3: dark\n- g2: light\n- h1: dark\n\nSo b7 bishop moves on **dark squares**.\n\nb3 is a **light square** \u2014 so **b7 bishop cannot attack b3**.\n\nSo no pin.\n\nBut what about **attacking the b3 knight**?\n\nCan we attack it?\n\n- Knight on d5? d5 to b3? d5 to b3 is two left, two down \u2014 not an L-shape. d5 to c3 is one left, two down \u2014 yes, but c3 is empty. b3 is two left, two down from d5 \u2014 that\u2019s not a knight move.\n\nSo d5 knight cannot attack b3.\n\nb8 knight: b8 to c6 or a6 \u2014 not attacking b3.\n\nSo no piece attacks b3.\n\nSo **a4 queen cannot capture c2 safely**.\n\nBut maybe we can **threaten something else**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Look for Tactical Opportunities**\n\n#### **Black's knight on d5**\n- It's centralized.\n- Can go to: c7, f6, f4, b4, e3, c3.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- **d5-f6**: f6 is light square. Is it attacked? White has bishop on g5 \u2014 g5 attacks f6! So if knight goes to f6, bishop on g5 can capture it.\n  - But is it defended? g7 bishop would recapture? g7 bishop on g7 \u2014 can it recapture on f6? Yes, g7 to f6 is diagonal \u2014 same color? g7 is dark, f6 is light \u2014 no. So **g7 bishop cannot recapture**.\n  - So **Nf6 loses material** unless there's another defender.\n  - After Nf6, Bxf6, Bxf6 \u2014 but Black loses knight for bishop, and White has better structure. Not good.\n\n- **d5-f4**: f4 is dark square. Is it attacked? d3 bishop attacks f5, but not f4. g5 bishop attacks f4? g5 to f4 is diagonal \u2014 yes, same color? g5 is light square? g5: g-file, 5th rank \u2014 g5 is dark square. f4 is dark square. So yes \u2014 **g5 bishop attacks f4**.\n  - So Nf4 can be taken by Bg5.\n  - Recapture? g7 bishop cannot recapture (f4 is dark, g7 is dark \u2014 yes, it can! g7 to f4 is diagonal: g7\u2013f6\u2013e5\u2013d4\u2013c3\u2013b2\u2013a1? No, that\u2019s not a straight diagonal.\n\nWait: g7 to f4: g7, f6, e5, d4, c3, b2, a1 \u2014 that\u2019s the a1\u2013h8 diagonal. Yes, g7 to f4 is **three squares diagonally down-left** \u2014 yes, it\u2019s a valid diagonal.\n\ng7 is dark, f4 is dark \u2014 yes, same color. So **g7 bishop can recapture on f4**"
