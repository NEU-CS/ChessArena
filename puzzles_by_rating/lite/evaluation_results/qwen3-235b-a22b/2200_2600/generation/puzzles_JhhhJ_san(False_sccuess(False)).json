When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the current position in FEN:\n\n```\n6kr/p7/4QPp1/3p4/2pP2P1/2P4P/rq6/5RK1 b - - 0 37\n```\n\nWe are told that the legal moves for Black are:\n\n- `g8f8`\n- `g8h7`\n\nSo, Black is to move, and the only legal moves involve the king on g8.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the position\n\nFEN: `6kr/p7/4QPp1/3p4/2pP2P1/2P4P/rq6/5RK1 b - - 0 37`\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- **Black to move**\n- Black king is on g8, and there's a rook on h8 \u2192 Black has king and rook on back rank.\n- White has a queen on e6, a pawn on f6 (passed pawn), and a rook on g1.\n- Black has a rook on a2 and queen on b2, both attacking the b-file.\n- White king is on g1.\n- White has a strong pawn on f6, supported by the queen on e6.\n- Black has pawns on a7, g6, d5, c4; White has pawns on d4, c3, g4, h3.\n\nWhite\u2019s last move must have been Qe6-f6+, delivering check.\n\nIndeed, the only legal moves for Black are king moves: `g8f8` and `g8h7`, both escaping check from the white queen on f6.\n\nSo, White just played **Qf6+**, and Black must respond.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the two legal moves\n\n#### Option 1: `g8f8` \u2014 King moves to f8\n\n- King moves to f8, out of check.\n- Now the king is on f8, rook on h8 still on back rank.\n- Is this safe?\n\nLet\u2019s see what White can do next.\n\nAfter `1...Kf8`, White can play:\n\n- **2. Qxg6** \u2014 capturing the g6 pawn with check!\n\nLet\u2019s see: Qf6 takes g6, with check because the queen is now on g6, attacking along the g-file.\n\nBlack king is on f8 \u2192 `Qg6+` is check.\n\nCan Black capture the queen? No. The only pieces near are the rook on h8 and king.\n\nSo Black must respond to `Qg6+`.\n\nPossible replies:\n\n- `Kg8` \u2014 back to g8\n- `Kf7` \u2014 but is that legal? Queen on g6 controls f7? Yes \u2014 g6 to f7 is diagonal, and queen controls that square. So `Kf7` is into check \u2014 illegal.\n\nSo only `Kg8` or possibly `Rh7` to block?\n\nWait: `Rh7` \u2014 rook on h8 to h7 \u2014 would that block?\n\nQueen on g6, king on f8 \u2014 the check is along the g-file. The queen attacks g8, g7, g6, etc.\n\nSo `Qg6+` attacks g8 and g7. The king is on f8, so the check is from g6 to g8 \u2014 but king is on f8, not g8.\n\nWait \u2014 **this is critical**.\n\nAfter `1...Kf8`, White plays `2. Qxg6+`.\n\nNow, queen on g6, king on f8.\n\nIs `Qg6+` actually check?\n\nQueen on g6 attacks:\n\n- Along the g-file: g8, g7, g6, g5...\n- Along the 6th rank: h6, f6, e6...\n- Diagonals: f5, e4, etc., and h7, h5...\n\nDoes it attack f8?\n\nFrom g6 to f8: that\u2019s one square left and two up \u2014 not diagonal. It\u2019s a knight move. So no.\n\n**g6 to f8 is not a queen move** \u2014 not same file, rank, or diagonal.\n\nSo **Qxg6 does NOT give check** if the king is on f8.\n\nAh! This is a key observation.\n\nSo after:\n\n1. ... Kf8  \n2. Qxg6?\n\nThis is **not check**. So Black can respond in time.\n\nBut is it good for White?\n\nLet\u2019s see: after `2. Qxg6`, Black can play:\n\n- `Qb1+` \u2014 the queen on b2 can go to b1, checking the white king on g1!\n\nYes! `Qb2-b1+` is check.\n\nWhite king is on g1, and the black queen attacks b1-g1 along the first rank.\n\nWhite must respond to check.\n\nPossible replies:\n\n- `Rf1` \u2014 rook on f1 blocks? Rook is on f1 already? Wait, White has rook on f1? FEN says: `5RK1` \u2014 so rook on f1, king on g1.\n\nSo `Rf1` is already there. Can it block? The queen is on b1, attacking along the first rank.\n\nSo `Rf1` is already on the first rank, but not between b1 and g1.\n\nSquares between: c1, d1, e1, f1.\n\nSo if White plays `Rf1` to block, but it\u2019s already on f1 \u2014 so it **is** on the line.\n\nWait \u2014 `Rf1` is on f1, which is between b1 and g1? Yes: b1-c1-d1-e1-f1-g1.\n\nSo `Rf1` can block the check by staying there? But it\u2019s already there.\n\nSo when Black plays `Qb1+`, White can **block** with `Rf1`, but it\u2019s already on f1 \u2014 so it\u2019s already blocking?\n\nNo: the rook is on f1, so it **is** on the path. So `Qb1+` is blocked by the rook on f1.\n\nSo `Qb1+` is **not check** \u2014 it\u2019s blocked.\n\nWait \u2014 is that correct?\n\nBlack queen on b1, White king on g1, White rook on f1.\n\nThe rook is on f1, which is on the b1-g1 line. So yes, it blocks the check.\n\nSo `Qb1+` is **not effective** \u2014 it\u2019s blocked.\n\nSo after `2. Qxg6`, Black cannot play `Qb1+` as a check.\n\nWhat else?\n\nBlack can play:\n\n- `Qc2` \u2014 attacking the rook on a2? No, rook is on a2, but queen is on b2.\n\nWait, Black has rook on a2, queen on b2.\n\nAfter `2. Qxg6`, Black can play:\n\n- `Ra1+` \u2014 rook on a2 to a1, checking the white king!\n\nYes! `Ra2-a1+` is check along the first rank.\n\nAnd now, can White block?\n\nRook on f1 is on f1 \u2014 not between a1 and g1. Squares between: b1, c1, d1, e1, f1.\n\nSo f1 is on the line \u2014 so the rook on f1 **can** block.\n\nBut `Ra1+` \u2014 rook to a1, attacking along first rank.\n\nWhite king on g1.\n\nSo the path is a1-b1-c1-d1-e1-f1-g1.\n\nWhite rook is on f1 \u2014 so it is on the path.\n\nSo `Ra1+` can be blocked by the rook on f1 \u2014 but it\u2019s already there.\n\nSo `Ra1+` is **blocked** \u2014 not check.\n\nSo neither `Qb1+` nor `Ra1+` are checks because the white rook on f1 blocks both.\n\nSo Black has no check along the first rank.\n\nSo after `2. Qxg6`, Black is just down material: White has captured g6, and Black has no immediate counterplay.\n\nBut Black can play `Qb6`, for example, attacking f6 or supporting d4?\n\nBut White is up a pawn and has a strong queen.\n\nBut more importantly \u2014 what about **promotion**?\n\nWhite has a pawn on f6, but it\u2019s already on f6 \u2014 next move would be f7, then f8=Q.\n\nBut after `1...Kf8 2. Qxg6`, Black can play `Ra1`? Not helpful.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **discovered attack**?\n\nBlack has rook on a2, queen on b2 \u2014 both on the second rank.\n\nIf Black moves the queen, could it uncover an attack?\n\nBut king is on f8.\n\nWait \u2014 more importantly: what about **Qf7#**?\n\nAfter `1...Kf8`, White can play:\n\n**2. Qf7#** \u2014 checkmate!\n\nQueen from f6 to f7 \u2014 is that check?\n\nKing on f8 \u2014 queen on f7: same file, one square up \u2014 yes, it attacks f8.\n\nIs there any piece that can capture the queen?\n\n- Black rook on h8? No.\n- Black queen on b2? No.\n- Any other piece? No.\n\nCan the king move? From f8, possible moves: f7 (occupied by queen), g8 (attacked by queen?), e"
