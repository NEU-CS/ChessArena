When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let\u2019s analyze the position.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **White king is on a4**, very far from the center.\n2. **Black king is on e5**, central and active.\n3. **Black has a passed pawn on c4**, advancing toward promotion.\n4. **White has pawns on b2 and c3**, but c3 is blocked by c4.\n5. **White\u2019s b2-pawn can advance**, but c3 is backward.\n6. **Black\u2019s f7-pawn is isolated**, but not immediately dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### Critical issue:\n- The **c4-c3** pawn tension is central.\n- If Black ever plays ...c3, it could be a passed pawn.\n- But currently, **c4 is a protected passed pawn** for Black.\n- White needs to **stop c4 from advancing** and **try to promote one of their own pawns**.\n\nBut White\u2019s pawns are on b2 and c3 \u2014 both on the 2nd and 3rd ranks. The **b-pawn** is the only one that can advance immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Legal moves:\n- `a4b5` \u2014 King to b5\n- `a4a5` \u2014 King to a5\n- `a4b4` \u2014 King to b4\n- `a4a3` \u2014 King to a3\n- `b2b3` \u2014 Pawn to b3\n- `b2b4` \u2014 Pawn to b4\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move Analysis:\n\n#### 1. `a4b5` (Kb5)\n- Attacks c4 pawn.\n- But after **...Kd5**, the black king comes to defend c4.\n- Then c4 is defended, and White king is exposed.\n- Also, after Kb5, if Black plays ...cxb3, axb3, then ...Kd5, Black king invades.\n- Not ideal \u2014 king goes forward but may get cut off.\n\n#### 2. `a4a5` (Ka5)\n- Moves king further up the a-file.\n- Doesn\u2019t help much \u2014 still far from center.\n- Doesn\u2019t challenge c4.\n- Loses time.\n\n#### 3. `a4b4` (Kb4)\n- **Very interesting**.\n- King moves to b4, **attacking the c4 pawn**.\n- c4 is defended only by the black king (on e5).\n- So if White plays Kb4, Black **must** respond to protect c4.\n- Black\u2019s only way to protect c4 is with king: ...Kd5 or ...Kd6 or ...Kf6, but ...Kd5 is best.\n- After Kb4, if Black doesn\u2019t respond, White captures c4.\n\nBut can White **safely** take on c4?\n\nWait: if Kb4, and Black plays ...Kd5, then c4 is defended. So White cannot take.\n\nBut now, **White can play b2-b3**, blocking the c4 pawn.\n\nSo idea: **Kb4 forces Black king to defend c4**, then White plays b3, blocking and fixing the pawn.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: is Kb4 safe?\n\nAfter Kb4, Black could consider ...cxb3, but then axb3, and the c4 pawn is gone \u2014 but Black gets an open a-file? Not really \u2014 no rooks.\n\nBut more importantly, after Kb4, if Black doesn\u2019t take, White plays b3.\n\nBut what if Black plays ...cxb3 immediately after Kb4?\n\n- Kb4, cxb3\n- axb3\nNow White has a pawn on b3, Black has pawn on c4.\n\nBut now Black king can go ...Kd5, and attack b3?\n\nWait: after axb3, the b3 pawn is on b3, which is defended by the king on a4? No \u2014 king is on b4.\n\nSo after:\n1. Kb4 cxb3\n2. axb3\n\nNow White king is on b4, pawn on b3, Black has c4 pawn.\n\nBut now ...Kd5 attacks b3 pawn.\n\nCan White defend it? Kb4\u2013a5? Then ...Kc5, and Black king invades.\n\nSo Kb4 followed by cxb3 might lose the b-pawn.\n\nBut if White instead plays **b3 first**, then cxb3, axb3, and now c4 is blocked.\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s better.\n\nLet\u2019s consider:\n\n#### 4. `b2b3` (b3)\n- Immediately blocks the c4 pawn.\n- After b3, if ...cxb3, then axb3, and now White has a pawn on b3, Black on c4.\n- But now c4 is blocked, and White king can come to b4 or a5 to support.\n\nBut after b3, Black can play ...cxb3, axb3, then ...Kd5, and now Black king attacks b3.\n\nCan White hold it?\n\n- Kc3? But king is on a4 \u2014 too far.\n- Need to bring king to c3 or b4.\n\nBut after ...Kd5, White plays Kb4, then Black can play ...Kc6, etc.\n\nBut White might be able to draw, but not win.\n\nBut our goal is to **win** or make progress.\n\n#### 5. `b2b4` (b4)\n- This is a **critical move**.\n- Advances the pawn to b4, **attacking the c4 pawn**.\n- After b4, if Black does nothing, White plays bxc5, winning the pawn.\n- So Black **must** respond.\n\nWhat can Black do?\n\n- If ...cxb3, then axb3, and now White has a b3 pawn, Black has nothing on c-file.\n- But more importantly, after b4, if ...cxb3, axb3, then White has a **passed b-pawn**!\n- And Black\u2019s king is on e5 \u2014 far away.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n1. b4 cxb3\n2. axb3\n\nNow White has a passed b-pawn on b3, Black has no pawns on a/b/c files.\n\nBlack king is on e5. Can it stop the b-pawn?\n\nLet\u2019s see: after axb3, Black plays ...Kd5, White plays Kc3 (but king is on a4 \u2014 needs to move).\n\nBut White can play **Kb5**, then Kc4, supporting b3.\n\nBut let\u2019s see the race:\n\n- White: b3, king on a4 \u2192 needs to go to b5, c4, etc.\n- Black: king on e5 \u2192 can go to d4, c3, etc.\n\nBut after:\n\n1. b4 cxb3\n2. axb3 Kd5\n3. Kb5 Kc5\n4. Kc4 Kb6\n5. b4 Ka6\n6. b5+ Ka5\n7. b6 Ka6\n8. b7 Kb6\n9. b8=Q+\n\nThis is winning!\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s check:\n\nAfter 1. b4 cxb3 2. axb3\n\nNow White has a passed b-pawn, and king can support it.\n\nBlack king must come to stop it, but it\u2019s far.\n\nEven:\n\n1. b4 cxb3\n2. axb3 Kd5\n3. Kb4! (king supports b3 and threatens to advance)\n\nNow if 3...Kc6, 4. Kc4, and b3 advances.\n\nEventually, b4-b5-b6-b7-b8=Q.\n\nAnd Black\u2019s f7 pawn is still on f7 \u2014 not moving.\n\nSo White will queen first and win.\n\nBut what if Black doesn\u2019t take?\n\nAfter 1. b4, Black could play ...c5?\n\nBut c4-c5? Is that possible?\n\nc4 to c5 \u2014 yes, but only if c5 is empty.\n\nCurrently, b4 is now occupied by White pawn.\n\nSo after b4, the c4 pawn is **blocked** \u2014 cannot go to c5.\n\nSo Black\u2019s only options are:\n\n- ...cxb3 (capture)\n- ...Kd5 (move king)\n- ...f6, etc.\n\nBut if Black doesn\u2019t take, White plays **bxc5**, winning the pawn for free.\n\nSo Black **must** capture: ...cxb3.\n\nThen axb3, and White has a passed pawn.\n\nSo **b2b4** forces the capture and creates a passed pawn.\n\nNow compare to other moves.\n\n#### 6."
