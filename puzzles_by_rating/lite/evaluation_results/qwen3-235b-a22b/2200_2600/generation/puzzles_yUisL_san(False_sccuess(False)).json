When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Currently, it\u2019s attacking d6, d5, d7, etc.\n- Queen on f3 can potentially target e4, d5, or even deliver checks if the king moves.\n- If Black doesn\u2019t act carefully, White might play something like Qf3-a8, winning the rook, or Qf3-d5+ forking king and knight.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at **Black\u2019s active pieces**:\n- Queen on e5: well-placed, controls central squares, can attack along the 5th rank and diagonals.\n- Rook on e6: active, on an open file, supports e5 queen.\n- Knight on e7: defensive for now, but can jump to d5.\n\nNow, let\u2019s go through the **candidate moves** one by one.\n\n---\n\n### **Candidate Move Analysis**\n\n#### 1. `c6c7` \u2013 King to c7\n- Moves king up to c7.\n- **Pros**: Gets away from d-file pressure, connects with rook on a8?\n- **Cons**: Walks into the open file. Now Rook on d4 can play Rd4-d7+! winning the rook on a8 or forking king and rook.\n  - After `c6c7`, White plays `d4d7!`, attacking both king and rook on a8.\n  - Black loses material: rook on a8 falls.\n- **Verdict**: **Losing**. Avoid.\n\n#### 2. `c6b6` \u2013 King to b6\n- King moves left, away from center.\n- Protects a6 pawn.\n- Gets off the d-file.\n- Now, is there a threat? White can\u2019t immediately play Rd4-d6 because e6 is occupied.\n- But queen on f3 might go to a8? Qf3-a8 is a threat to win the rook.\n  - But after Kb6, Qa8 is not check, and Black can play ...Kc6 again or Rxa8.\n  - But White might follow up with Qxa8, and if Black recaptures with Rxa8, then no immediate win.\n- However, Kb6 removes king from central danger.\n- But is it the best?\n\nHold judgment.\n\n#### 3. `c6c5` \u2013 King to c5\n- Centralizes king slightly.\n- But now king is on c5, very exposed.\n- White can play Qf3-d5+, forking king and knight on e7!\n  - After `c6c5`, Qf3-d5+ checks, and attacks knight on e7.\n  - Black must move king, loses knight.\n- **Verdict**: **Losing** \u2013 knight hangs. Avoid.\n\n#### 4. `c6b5` \u2013 King to b5\n- Very aggressive king move.\n- Threatens the a6 pawn? No, a6 is Black\u2019s own pawn.\n- But now king is on b5, extremely exposed.\n- White can play Qf3-d5+ again? Let\u2019s see:\n  - Qd5+ checks, knight on e7 is pinned? No, not yet.\n  - After Kb5, Qd5+ is check, king must move: Kc6 or Kb6.\n  - But also, Rd4-b4+ is possible: Rb4+ forces king to a6 or c6, then Qd5+ might follow.\n  - Also, Qf3-a8 wins rook again? After Kb5, Qa8, Black can\u2019t easily defend a8.\n- This king move looks **too risky**.\n- Also, potential for White to play c3-c4+ or something.\n- **Verdict**: Too dangerous. Likely losing.\n\n#### 5. `e7d5` \u2013 Knight to d5\n- Knight jumps to d5, attacking queen on f3?\n  - Nxd5, Qf3 is attacked.\n  - But White can play Qf3xd5+, winning the knight with check.\n  - So if Black plays Nxd5, Qxd5, Rxd5, and now White has won a knight.\n  - But Black has two rooks and queen, so material: did Black lose material?\n    - Black gives knight, White gives queen \u2192 roughly equal (knight ~3, queen ~9), so Black loses exchange and more.\n  - Wait: no, **Qf3 is defended?** By whom?\n    - White king on d2, no direct defender.\n    - Is Qf3 hanging to Nxd5?\n      - Nxd5 attacks Qf3.\n      - Can White recapture? Qf3xd5+ is possible, yes.\n      - So after `e7d5`, `f3d5` (Qxd5), `e6xd5` (R captures), now:\n        - Black loses knight, White loses queen.\n        - Material: Black lost 3, White lost 9 \u2192 Black gains 6 points.\n        - But wait: is that correct? No: Black played Nxd5, White captured knight with Q, then Black captured queen with rook.\n        - So net: **White loses queen, Black loses knight** \u2192 huge advantage for Black.\n      - But is the queen on f3 **undefended**?\n        - Let\u2019s check: who guards Qf3?\n          - King on d2? Not guarding f3.\n          - Rook on d4? On d4, doesn't guard f3.\n          - Other pieces? No.\n        - So **Qf3 is undefended**!\n        - Therefore, **Nxd5 wins the queen** because after Qxd5, Rxd5, White has lost queen for knight.\n        - But wait: after `e7d5`, White must respond. If they don\u2019t move queen, Black just captures it.\n        - But White can play `f3d5` (Qxd5), but then `e6xd5` and White has lost queen.\n        - So Black wins queen for knight \u2014 a massive gain.\n\nWait \u2014 but is there a **check** involved?\n\nAfter `e7d5`, knight attacks queen on f3. White is in check? No, king is not in check.\n\nSo White can play `f3d5` (QxN), but then Black plays `e6xd5`, capturing the queen.\n\nSo **material outcome**: Black sacrifices knight, wins queen \u2014 a **clear win**.\n\nBut is there a better move?\n\nWait \u2014 what if White doesn\u2019t take the knight? Then Black just captures the queen on f3 with the knight: `d5f3` \u2014 but that\u2019s not in the move list. The only knight move listed is `e7d5`.\n\nBut `e7d5` is a move that attacks the queen. So after `e7d5`, if White doesn\u2019t respond, next move Black plays `d5f3` and wins queen.\n\nBut White will respond.\n\nSo either:\n- White plays `f3d5` (QxN), then `e6xd5` \u2014 Black wins queen for knight.\n- Or White moves queen elsewhere, say `f3g3`, then Black plays `d5f3` and wins queen anyway.\n\nSo **in all lines, Black wins the white queen** for a knight.\n\nThat\u2019s a **huge advantage**.\n\nSo `e7d5` seems **winning**.\n\nBut let\u2019s check other moves.\n\n#### 6. `e5d5` \u2013 Queen takes on d5\n- Queen moves from e5 to d5.\n- What\u2019s on d5? Nothing \u2014 it\u2019s a capture? But no piece there.\n- Wait: is this a typo? Or is it just queen moving to d5?\n- But d5 is empty. So this is just Qe5-d5.\n- Why? To centralize? To connect with knight?\n- But now, White can play `d4d"
