When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

FEN Notation:**\n`5r2/p5k1/8/2p3p1/2P1prP1/1P1p2RP/P2R1P2/6K1 w - - 1 34`\n\nThis tells us:\n\n- **White to move**\n- **White has a rook on h3, rook on d2, pawn on g2, f2, a2, b3, c4**\n- **Black has rook on f8, rook on e4, pawns on a7, c5, d3, f4, g5, and king on g7**\n- White king is on g1\n- Black king is on g7\n- No castling rights\n- No en passant\n- Move count: 34, White to play\n\n---\n\n### **2. Visualizing the Position**\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the key elements:\n\n#### **White Pieces:**\n- King: g1\n- Rooks: d2, h3\n- Pawns: a2, b3, c4, f2, g2, h3 \u2192 wait, h3 is a rook. Pawns: a2, b3, c4, f2, g2, and **a2, b3** are on 2nd rank\n- Also, **d2** is a rook\n\n#### **Black Pieces:**\n- King: g7\n- Rooks: f8, e4\n- Pawns: a7, c5, d3, f4, g5\n\n#### **Critical Features:**\n\n- **Black has a dangerous passed pawn on d3**, very close to queening. It's on d3, one square from d2, which is occupied by White\u2019s rook.\n- **White\u2019s rook on d2 is pinned?** Let's see: d2 is on the d-file. Black has a rook on e4, but no direct pin. But d3 is occupied by a black pawn, so d2 is defending d3 indirectly?\n- Wait: **d3 is a black pawn**, so **White\u2019s rook on d2 is blocking the d3 pawn from queening** \u2014 it's **defending d2 square**, but the pawn is on d3, so if the rook moves, d3-d2 is possible, then d2-d1=Q next move.\n- So **d2 is a critical square** \u2014 White must prevent ...d2=Q.\n\n- **Black\u2019s rook on e4** is attacking along the 4th rank, and is **attacking the g4 square**, but more importantly, it's **attacking the h3 rook**? No \u2014 h3 is on h3, e4 to h3 is diagonal? No, e4-h3 is not a straight file/rank. e4 to h4 is horizontal, but h3 is one below. So **no direct attack on h3 rook**.\n\n- But **White\u2019s rook on h3 is supporting g3**, and **g3 is occupied by a rook? Wait \u2014 h3 is the rook, so g3 is empty?**\n\nWait \u2014 FEN: `.../1P1p2RP/P2R1P2/...`\n\nLet\u2019s break down the ranks:\n\n- Rank 3: `1P1p2RP` \u2192 b3, d3 (black), g3, h3 \u2192 so **g3 has a piece?** `RP` at the end \u2192 so h3=Rook, g3=Pawn? But White already has a pawn on g2.\n\nWait \u2014 let's parse FEN properly.\n\nFEN: `5r2/p5k1/8/2p3p1/2P1prP1/1P1p2RP/P2R1P2/6K1`\n\nLet\u2019s go rank by rank (from rank 8 to 1):\n\n- **Rank 8**: `5r2` \u2192 5 empty, then rook, then 2 empty \u2192 so f8 = black rook\n- **Rank 7**: `p5k1` \u2192 a7=black pawn, 5 empty, g7=king, h1? no \u2014 `k1` \u2192 g7=king, h7 empty? `k1` means king, then 1 empty \u2192 so g7=K, h7=empty\n- **Rank 6**: `8` \u2192 all empty\n- **Rank 5**: `2p3p1` \u2192 2 empty, c5=black pawn, 3 empty, g5=black pawn, h5 empty\n- **Rank 4**: `2P1prP1` \u2192 2 empty, c4=white pawn, d4 empty, e4=black rook, f4=black pawn, g4=white pawn, h4 empty\n- **Rank 3**: `1P1p2RP` \u2192 a3 empty, b3=white pawn, c3 empty, d3=black pawn, e3 empty, f3 empty, g3=white pawn, h3=white rook\n- **Rank 2**: `P2R1P2` \u2192 a2=white pawn, b2 empty, c2 empty, d2=white rook, e2 empty, f2=white pawn, g2=white pawn, h2 empty\n- **Rank 1**: `6K1` \u2192 6 empty, g1=white king, h1 empty\n\nSo correction:\n\n- **White pawns**: a2, b3, c4, f2, g2, g3\n- **White rooks**: d2, h3\n- **Black pawns**: a7, c5, d3, f4, g5\n- **Black rooks**: e4 (on e4), f8\n- **Black king**: g7\n- **White king**: g1\n\nNow, **d3 is a black pawn**, on d3, one square from queening on d2, but d2 is occupied by **White\u2019s rook**.\n\nSo **if White moves the d2 rook, Black plays ...d2-d1=Q**, promoting with check.\n\nTherefore, **White cannot move the d2 rook unless it's a capture or check**, or unless d2 is defended.\n\nBut currently, **d2 is only occupied by the rook**, and if it moves, ...d1=Q+ is coming.\n\nSo **any move of d2 rook must be very careful**.\n\nNow, **Black\u2019s d3 pawn is a huge threat** \u2014 it's a **passed pawn**, and very close to promotion.\n\nWhite must **either capture it, block it, or force a trade**.\n\nBut currently, **no piece can capture on d3** \u2014 only if a rook or queen were on c3 or e3, but they aren't.\n\nSo **White\u2019s main problem is: the d3 pawn threatens ...d2=Q next time if the rook moves**.\n\nBut currently, **it's White\u2019s move**, so White can act.\n\nSo **White must prevent ...d2=Q**.\n\nHow?\n\n- Either **keep the rook on d2**, or\n- **Move the rook with check or capture**, or\n- **Defend d2** so that even if rook moves, d2 is covered.\n\nBut currently, **no piece defends d2** except the rook itself.\n\nSo if rook moves, d2 is undefended \u2192 ...d1=Q+.\n\nSo **moving d2 rook is dangerous unless it gives check or captures**.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **legal moves** provided:\n\n```\ng3f3, g3e3, g3d3, g3g2, \nd2d3, d2e2, d2c2, d2b2, d2d1, \ng1h2, g1g2, g1h1, g1f1, \nh3h4, \nb3b4, \nf2f3, \na2a3, a2a4\n```\n\nLet\u2019s analyze them.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Candidate Moves Analysis**\n\n#### **A. g3f3, g3e3, g3d3** \u2014 moving g3 pawn\n- g3f3: pawn to f3\n  - f3 is attacked by black rook on e4? e4 to f4 is adjacent, but f3 is one back \u2014 e4 attacks f4, but not f3 directly.\n  - But f3 is on same file as f2, f4 \u2014 f4 has black pawn.\n  - Moving g3 to f3: opens diagonal for king? Not really.\n  - But **does it help stop d3? No.**\n  - Also, **after g3f3, Black can play ...d2xd1=Q**, because d2 rook is still there, but if White moves g3f3, Black can just play ...d2=Q next? No \u2014 d2 is still occupied.\n\nWait \u2014 **d2 is occupied by White rook**, so **d3-d2 is not possible** \u2014 the pawn cannot move forward because d2 is blocked.\n\nAh! **Critical point**:\n\n- **Black\u2019s d3 pawn cannot move to d2 because d2 is occupied by White\u2019s rook**.\n- So **promotion is blocked** \u2014 **as long as the rook stays on d2**, the"
