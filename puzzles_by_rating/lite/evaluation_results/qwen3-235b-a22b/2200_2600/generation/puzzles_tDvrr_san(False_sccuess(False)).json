When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Board Visualization**\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the board:\n\n```\n8:  -  -  r  -  -  -  k  -\n7:  p  -  -  -  f  p  -  h\n6:  -  q  -  -  e  -  p  -\n5:  -  p  b  -  -  f  b  -\n4:  -  -  p  -  -  f  -  -\n3:  -  -  -  -  -  -  N  P\n2:  P  P  -  -  -  P  P  -\n1:  -  -  R  Q  R  B  K  -\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 let's correct the notation: FEN uses lowercase for Black, uppercase for White.\n\nSo:\n\n- White pieces: K, Q, R, B, N, P\n- Black pieces: k, q, r, b, n, p\n\nLet\u2019s parse the FEN properly:\n\n```\n8:  -  -  r  -  -  -  k  -\n7:  p  -  -  -  p  -  p  -\n6:  -  q  -  -  p  -  p  -\n5:  -  p  b  -  -  f  b  -\n4:  -  -  p  -  -  f  -  -\n3:  -  -  -  -  -  -  N  P\n2:  P  P  -  -  -  P  P  -\n1:  -  -  R  Q  R  B  K  -\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 F5 is \"f\", but that should be \"b\" for black bishop. Typo in my note.\n\nCorrecting:\n\nFEN: `2r3k1/p4p1p/1q2p1p1/1pb2b2/2p2P2/6NP/PP3PP1/2RQRBK1`\n\nSo:\n\n**Rank 8**: --r--k-  \n**Rank 7**: p---p-p-  \n**Rank 6**: -q--p-p-  \n**Rank 5**: -pb--b--  \n**Rank 4**: --p--P--  \n**Rank 3**: ------NP  \n**Rank 2**: PP---PP-  \n**Rank 1**: --RQR-BK\n\nNow placing:\n\n### **White Pieces**\n- King: g1\n- Queen: d1\n- Rooks: c1, e1 (but e1 is R, f1 is B, so rooks on c1 and e1)\n- Bishop: f1\n- Knight: g3\n- Pawns: f4, g2, h2, a2, b2, f2, g3? No \u2014 g3 has knight. Pawns: a2, b2, f2, g2, h2, f4, h3 (h3 is pawn? No \u2014 g3h3 is knight and pawn? Wait: rank 3: 6NP \u2192 six empty, then N, P \u2192 so h3 is pawn, g3 is knight.\n\nSo White pawns: a2, b2, f2, g2, h2, f4, h3\n\nWait \u2014 h3 is a pawn? But g3 is knight, h3 is pawn \u2014 yes.\n\nBut in FEN: rank 3 is `6NP` \u2192 so a3 to f3 empty, g3=N, h3=P \u2192 yes.\n\nSo White pawns: a2, b2, f2, g2, h2, f4, h3\n\nBut g2 and h2 are pawns, yes.\n\n### **Black Pieces**\n- King: g8\n- Queen: b6\n- Rook: c8\n- Bishops: c5, f5\n- Pawns: a7, c7, c4, e6, f7, g6, h7\n\nWait: rank 7: p---p-p- \u2192 a7, e7, g7\nrank 6: -q--p-p- \u2192 b6 (queen), e6, g6\nrank 5: -pb--b-- \u2192 b5, c5 (b), f5 (b)\nrank 4: --p--P-- \u2192 c4 (black), f4 is white, so c4 is black pawn\n\nSo Black pawns: a7, c7? No \u2014 c7 not mentioned. Rank 7: a7, e7, g7 \u2014 so c7 is empty. c5 is bishop, so c7 is empty.\n\nc4 is pawn, so c-pawn advanced.\n\nSo Black pawns: a7, c4, e6, f7, g6, h7 \u2014 and b5? b5 is pawn? FEN rank 5: `1pb2b2` \u2192 so b5 is pawn, c5 is bishop.\n\nSo b5 is black pawn.\n\nSo Black pawns: a7, b5, c4, e6, f7, g6, h7\n\n---\n\n### **Material Count**\n\nWhite:\n- Q, 2R, B, N, 7 pawns\n\nBlack:\n- Q, R, 2B, 7 pawns\n\nSo White has extra rook, Black has extra bishop. Material: White is **up a rook for a bishop** \u2014 huge advantage.\n\nBut it's move 23 \u2014 so likely White has sacrificed or won material earlier.\n\nOur job: **press the advantage and convert**.\n\n---\n\n### **Positional Assessment**\n\nWhite has:\n- King on g1 \u2014 safe for now\n- Queen on d1\n- Rooks on c1 and e1\n- Bishop on f1\n- Knight on g3\n- Pawns: a2, b2, f2, g2, h2, f4, h3\n\nBlack:\n- King on g8 \u2014 potentially vulnerable\n- Queen on b6 \u2014 attacking d4? But d4 not occupied\n- Rook on c8 \u2014 connected with queen\n- Bishops on c5 and f5\n- Pawns: a7, b5, c4, e6, f7, g6, h7\n\n**Key features**:\n\n- Black king is on g8, castled. But no pawns in front \u2014 f7, g6, h7. f7 is weak (only king defends? f7 is defended by king and queen? Queen is on b6 \u2014 can it defend f7? No, not directly. f7 is only defended by king.\n\n- White has a **battery on the e-file**: e1 rook and e6? No \u2014 e6 is black pawn. But e-file is open? e-file: e8 empty, e7=p, e6=p, e5 empty, e4 empty, e3 empty, e2 empty, e1=R. So not open.\n\nBut White has rooks on c1 and e1. Black has rook on c8 \u2014 so **c-file is contested**.\n\nc-file: c8=R, c7=empty, c6=empty, c5=B, c4=p, c3=empty, c2=empty, c1=R \u2192 so half-open for White.\n\nBut c4 is a black pawn, c5 black bishop \u2014 so White can play c3 or c4?\n\nBut more importantly: **White has a massive lead in development and material** \u2014 must **avoid counterplay** and **aim for checkmate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Tactical Opportunities**\n\nLet\u2019s look for **checks, captures, threats**.\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLet\u2019s scan the legal moves:\n\nList:  \ng3h5, g3f5, g3e4, g3e2, g3h1,  \ng1h2, g1h1,  \nf1c4, f1d3, f1e2,  \ne1e6, e1e5, e1e4, e1e3, e1e2,  \nd1d8, d1d7, d1d6, d1h5, d1d5, d1g4, d1d4, d1a4, d1f3, d1d3, d1b3, d1e2, d1d2, d1c2,  \nc1c4, c1c3, c1c2, c1b1, c1a1,  \nh3h4, b2b3, a2a3, b2b4, a2a4\n\nLet\u2019s look for **forcing moves**.\n\n---\n\n### **Candidate Moves**\n\n#### 1. **e1-e6** \u2014 Rook takes e6 pawn?\n\ne6 is a black pawn. Is it defended?\n\ne6 is defended by:\n- f7 pawn? No, diagonal \u2014 no"
