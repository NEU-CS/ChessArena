When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Actually: `6g1` would be 6 empty, then g, then 1 \u2014 but it's `6g1`? No.\n\nWait, correction:\n\nFEN breakdown:\n\n- 8: `7Q` \u2192 7 empty, Q \u2192 h8\n- 7: `q3kp2` \u2192 q, 3 empty, k, p, 2 empty \u2192 a7=q, e7=k, f7=p\n- 6: `7p` \u2192 7 empty, p \u2192 h6=p\n- 5: `6g1` \u2192 no, it's `6g1`? Wait, no: it's `6g1`? Wait, the FEN says: `6g1`?\n\nWait, no: the FEN is: `7Q/q3kp2/7p/6g1/2P1Pp2/5K1P/6P1/8`\n\nWait \u2014 no, the original says: `7Q/q3kp2/7p/6g1/2P1Pp2/5K1P/6P1/8`?\n\nNo \u2014 original: `7Q/q3kp2/7p/6g1/2P1Pp2/5K1H/6P1/8`?\n\nWait, no \u2014 user input:\n\n`7Q/q3kp2/7p/6g1/2P1Pp2/5K1P/6P1/8 w - - 7 48`\n\nWait \u2014 no, it says: `6g1`? No, it says: `6g1`? Let's look:\n\nActually: `7Q/q3kp2/7p/6g1/2P1Pp2/5K1P/6P1/8`\n\nWait \u2014 no, the user wrote: `7Q/q3kp2/7p/6g1/2P1Pp2/5K1P/6P1/8 w - - 7 48`\n\nBut that can't be \u2014 `6g1`? That would be 6 empty, then g, then 1 empty? But `g` is not a valid piece.\n\nWait \u2014 no, the FEN uses lowercase for black pieces.\n\nWait \u2014 `6g1` \u2014 that would be 6 empty squares, then a black piece 'g'? But there is no piece 'g'.\n\nAh! Typo? Let's recheck the user input:\n\nUser wrote: `7Q/q3kp2/7p/6g1/2P1Pp2/5K1P/6P1/8 w - - 7 48`\n\nWait \u2014 no, it says: `6g1`? That must be a typo.\n\nWait \u2014 no, actually: `6g1` \u2014 but in standard FEN, pieces are:\n\n- P/p: pawn\n- N/n: knight\n- B/b: bishop\n- R/r: rook\n- Q/q: queen\n- K/k: king\n\nThere is no 'g'. So likely a typo.\n\nWait \u2014 the original says: `6g1`? Or is it `6p1`?\n\nLooking again: `7Q/q3kp2/7p/6g1/...` \u2014 no, it says `6g1`? That can't be.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps it's `6p1`? Because `6g1` makes no sense.\n\nWait \u2014 let's read carefully: `7Q/q3kp2/7p/6g1/2P1Pp2/5K1P/6P1/8`\n\nWait \u2014 no, the fourth rank is `6g1`? That would be 6 empty, then g, then 1 empty \u2014 but `g` is not a valid piece.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps it's a typo and it's meant to be `6p1`?\n\nBut let's look at the fifth rank: `2P1Pp2` \u2014 that's c4=P, e4=P, f4=p\n\nFourth rank: `6g1` \u2014 no, that must be a typo.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps it's `6p1`? Meaning g5=p?\n\nBut the user wrote: `6g1` \u2014 but in context, likely meant `6p1`? Or `6P1`?\n\nWait \u2014 no, black pawns are lowercase.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps it's `6p1` \u2014 meaning 6 empty, p, 1 empty \u2192 g5=p\n\nBut user wrote `6g1` \u2014 that would be 6 empty, g, 1 empty \u2014 invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's `6P1`? But that would be white pawn.\n\nBut the rank is 5th rank (from top: 8,7,6,5) \u2014 so 5th rank is `6g1`? No.\n\nWait \u2014 let's count:\n\nFEN:  \n- 8: 7Q \u2192 7 empty, Q \u2192 h8=Q  \n- 7: q3kp2 \u2192 a7=q, e7=k, f7=p  \n- 6: 7p \u2192 h6=p  \n- 5: 6g1 \u2192 ??? invalid\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps it's `6p1`? That would make sense: 6 empty, p, 1 empty \u2192 g5=p\n\nBut user wrote `6g1` \u2014 likely a typo for `6p1`?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's `6P1`? But that would be white pawn.\n\nBut let's look at the next rank: `2P1Pp2` \u2192 c4=P, e4=P, f4=p\n\nAnd `5K1P` \u2192 e3=K, h3=P\n\nAnd `6P1` \u2192 g2=P\n\nSo pawns:  \n- White: c4, e4, h3, g2, and possibly on d5? No.\n\nWait \u2014 rank 5: if it's `6p1`, then g5=p\n\nBut user wrote `6g1` \u2014 that must be a typo.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's `6/1` \u2014 no.\n\nWait \u2014 maybe it's `6p1` and the user mistyped 'p' as 'g'? Because 'g' is next to 'p' on the keyboard? Unlikely.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps it's `6/1` \u2014 no.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe it's `6p1` and it's displayed wrong.\n\nBut let's look at the legal moves provided:\n\nLegal moves:  \nh8g8, h8f8, h8e8, h8d8, h8c8, h8b8, h8a8, h8h7, h8g7, h8h6, h8f6, h8e5, h8d4, h8c3, h8b2, h8a1, f3g4, f3e2, e4e5, c4c5, h3h4, g2g3, g2g4\n\nSo White has a king on f3, queen on h8, pawns on c4, e4, h3, g2.\n\nBlack has queen on a7, king on e7, pawns on f7, h6, g5?, f4, and possibly others.\n\nFrom the FEN: `7p` on 6th rank \u2192 h6=p\n\n`6g1` on 5th rank \u2014 if it's `6p1`, then g5=p\n\n`2P1Pp2` on 4th rank \u2192 c4=P, e4=P, f4=p\n\n`5K1P` on 3"
