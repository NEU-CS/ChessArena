If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

The b4-pawn is advanced but blocked by nothing. The c2 pawn is on its starting square.\n\nBlack has no pawns. Only king and bishop.\n\nMaterial: Black has king + bishop; White has king + two pawns. So White is slightly ahead in material, but endgame with king + pawns vs king + bishop can be drawn if the pawns are not too advanced.\n\nBut here, the **b4-pawn is close to queening**, and the white king is nearby (d5), supporting it.\n\nBlack\u2019s goal: **Prevent the b-pawn from promoting**, or **capture the pawns**, or **force a draw** if winning is not possible.\n\nBut is **Black winning**? Unlikely. But perhaps **Black can draw** or even **win** if White blunders.\n\nWait \u2014 let's check: **Can Black win?**\n\nBlack has no pawns. So **Black cannot win unless White promotes and Black captures the queen**, but that would be a draw unless Black can force mate.\n\nSo realistically, **Black cannot win** \u2014 no pawns, so no way to checkmate unless White blunders into a smothered mate, which is impossible here.\n\nSo **Black\u2019s goal is to draw**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is a **draw possible**?\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the pawns.\n\nWhite\u2019s pawns:\n- b4: one step from b5, then b6, b7, b8=Q. Needs 4 moves to promote.\n- c2: needs 6 moves to promote.\n\nBut the white king is on d5 \u2014 close to both.\n\nBlack king is on g6 \u2014 very far.\n\nBlack bishop is on b5 \u2014 **attacking the b4 pawn!**\n\nAh! **The b4 pawn is under attack by the bishop on b5**.\n\nSo if White doesn't protect or move the pawn, Black can capture it.\n\nBut it's **Black to move** \u2014 so Black can **capture b4**?\n\nWait: bishop on b5, pawn on b4 \u2014 yes, **Bxb4 is possible**.\n\nIs **b5b4** in the legal moves list?\n\nWait \u2014 the legal moves are listed as:\n\n```\nb5e8, b5d7, b5c6, b5a6, b5c4, b5a4, b5d3, b5e2, b5f1\n```\n\nWait \u2014 **b5c4**, **b5a4**, **b5c6**, etc., but **no b5b4**?\n\nThat\u2019s odd. Shouldn't Bb5 be able to capture on b4?\n\nBut b4 is occupied by a white pawn. So **Bxb4** should be legal.\n\nBut it's not in the list.\n\nWait \u2014 is the move **b5b4**? In UCI, captures are written the same as moves \u2014 just from-square to to-square.\n\nSo **b5b4** should be the move.\n\nBut it's not in the list.\n\nThe list has:\n- b5c4\n- b5a4\n- b5c6\n- etc.\n\nBut **not b5b4**.\n\nWhy?\n\nWait \u2014 is the b4 square occupied by a white pawn? Yes.\n\nCan the bishop capture it? Yes \u2014 same color diagonal?\n\nBishop on b5 is light-squared (b5 is light square).\n\nb4 is dark square.\n\nWait \u2014 **b5 is a light square**, bishop moves diagonally \u2014 so it can only go to light squares.\n\nb4 is a **dark square** \u2014 so **bishop cannot go to b4**.\n\nAh! **Critical observation**.\n\nThe bishop on b5 is on a **light square**, so it controls light squares.\n\nb4 is a **dark square** \u2014 so **the bishop cannot capture the pawn on b4**.\n\nSo **Bb5 does not attack b4**.\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- b5: file b, rank 5 \u2192 b is 2nd file, 5th rank \u2192 color: (2+5)=7 \u2192 odd \u2192 dark? Wait, standard coloring: a1 is dark.\n\nWait \u2014 better to visualize:\n\n- a1 = dark\n- b1 = light\n- a2 = light\n- b2 = dark\n- b5: b-file, 5th rank \u2192 b1=light, b2=dark, b3=light, b4=dark, b5=light.\n\nSo b5 is **light square**.\n\nb4 is b4 \u2192 b1=light, b2=dark, b3=light, b4=dark.\n\nSo b4 is **dark square**.\n\nBishop on b5 (light square) moves only on light squares.\n\nSo it **cannot go to b4** (dark), so **cannot capture the pawn on b4**.\n\nSo the bishop **does not attack the b4 pawn**.\n\nSimilarly, can it attack c4? c4: c-file, 4th rank \u2192 c1=dark, c2=light, c3=dark, c4=light \u2192 light square \u2192 yes, bishop can go to c4.\n\nSo **Bb5-c4** is possible \u2014 and c4 is light square.\n\nBut c4 is empty.\n\nSo bishop can go to c4, but not to b4.\n\nSo **the b4 pawn is safe** from the bishop.\n\nBut what about the **c2 pawn**? c2 is dark square \u2014 bishop on light squares cannot attack it either.\n\nSo **Black\u2019s bishop cannot attack either of White\u2019s pawns**.\n\nMoreover, the **Black king is on g6**, very far from the action.\n\nWhite\u2019s king is on d5, close to both pawns and ready to support promotion.\n\nWhite\u2019s plan: push b4-b5-b6-b7-b8=Q, with king support.\n\nBut Black must try to **draw**.\n\nCan Black draw?\n\nLet\u2019s see if White can force promotion.\n\nWhite wants to play b5, but it's Black\u2019s move.\n\nBut Black cannot stop b4-b5 because bishop can\u2019t capture on b5? Wait \u2014 if White plays b5, then pawn on b5 \u2014 same square as bishop?\n\nNo \u2014 bishop is on b5.\n\nSo **the b5 square is occupied by Black\u2019s bishop**.\n\nAh! **Crucial point**.\n\nThe **b5 square is occupied by Black\u2019s bishop**, so **White cannot play b4-b5** because b5 is occupied.\n\nSo the **b4 pawn is blocked** by the bishop on b5.\n\nSo **White cannot advance the b-pawn** unless the bishop moves away.\n\nSimilarly, the c2 pawn is far away, but White king can support it.\n\nBut c-pawn: c2-c3-c4-c5-c6-c7-c8=Q \u2014 long way.\n\nBut White king is on d5 \u2014 can go to support c-pawn.\n\nBut Black king is on g6 \u2014 can it race to stop the c-pawn?\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\nSuppose Black does nothing \u2014 White plays Kd5-c5, then b4-b5? No \u2014 b5 is occupied.\n\nSo White must first **force the bishop away from b5**.\n\nBut currently, **the bishop on b5 is blocking the b-pawn**.\n\nSo **Black can prevent immediate promotion** by keeping the bishop on b5.\n\nBut if Black moves the bishop, White plays b5.\n\nSo **Black must not move the bishop from b5 unless necessary**.\n\nBut it's Black to move \u2014 so Black **must** move either king or bishop.\n\nIf Black moves the bishop from b5, then White plays"
