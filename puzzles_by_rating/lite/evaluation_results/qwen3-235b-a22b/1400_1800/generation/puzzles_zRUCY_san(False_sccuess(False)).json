When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

That can't be.\n\nWait \u2014 FEN: `8/6p1/4K1k1/...`\n\n`6p1` means: 6 empty, then a **p** (black pawn), then 1 empty \u2192 so **g7** is a black pawn.\n\nBut then `4K1k1` \u2192 e6 is white king, g6 is black king.\n\nSo black king on g6, black pawn on g7 \u2014 that's **on the same file**, but that's allowed \u2014 king on g6, pawn on g7 \u2014 yes, it's possible.\n\nBut now, **g2 has a black bishop**, and **c2 has a black pawn**.\n\nWhite has:\n- King on e6\n- Bishop on g5\n- Pawns on d4, f2, h4\n\nBlack has:\n- King on g6\n- Bishop on g2\n- Pawns on c2, g7, h5\n\nNow, it's **Black to move**.\n\n### Legal moves provided:\n```\ng6h7, g2a8, g2b7, g2c6, g2d5, g2e4, g2h3, g2f3, g2h1, g2f1, c2c1q, c2c1r, c2c1b, c2c1n\n```\n\nSo the only movable pieces are:\n- King: g6 \u2192 h7\n- Bishop: g2 \u2192 various squares\n- Pawn: c2 \u2192 c1 with promotion\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each possibility.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Immediate threats and goals\n\n### Black's c2 pawn is about to promote.\n- c2 \u2192 c1 is one move away from queening.\n- But is it safe?\n\nWhite has:\n- Bishop on g5 \u2014 controls diagonal a1-h8? Let's see: g5 \u2192 f6 \u2192 e7 \u2192 d8? No, g5 is light-squared bishop? g5 is light square (g-file odd, 5 odd \u2192 light), so it controls light squares.\n\nc1 is a **dark square** (c1: c odd, 1 odd \u2192 dark). So **White's bishop on g5 cannot control c1**.\n\nWhite king is on e6 \u2014 can it reach c1 in time?\n\nFrom e6 to c1: e6 \u2192 d5 \u2192 c4 \u2192 c3 \u2192 c2 \u2192 c1: 5 moves. Too far.\n\nWhite has no other pieces near. f2 pawn is stuck.\n\nSo **c2-c1=Q is safe** \u2014 no immediate capture.\n\nBut after c2-c1=Q, does White have a **stalemate or counter-checkmate**?\n\nLet\u2019s consider: after **c2-c1=Q**, what happens?\n\nBlack queen on c1, but what about the position?\n\nBlack king on g6, White king on e6, White bishop on g5.\n\nBut also: **Black has a bishop on g2**, which will still be on the board.\n\nSo after c1 promotion, Black will have **queen + bishop + king** vs **king + bishop + pawns**.\n\nBut more importantly \u2014 is **stalemate** a possibility?\n\nLet\u2019s see: after c2-c1=Q, is Black in check? No.\n\nDoes Black have any other moves? Yes \u2014 king can move, bishop can move.\n\nSo **not stalemate**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 could promoting immediately lead to a draw due to insufficient material or perpetual?\n\nNo \u2014 Black will have queen and bishop \u2014 more than enough to win.\n\nBut perhaps **there is a faster or safer way**.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the **king move**: g6-h7.\n\nWhy would we do that?\n\nCurrently, Black king on g6, White bishop on g5 \u2014 is the king in check? No \u2014 g5 attacks f6, h6, e7, f4, etc., but not g6 (same diagonal? g5 to g6 is vertical \u2014 no, bishop moves diagonally).\n\ng5 to g6 is vertical \u2014 not diagonal. So **not attacked**.\n\ng6 is adjacent to h5 (black pawn), g7 (black pawn), f6, f5, h6, h7, etc.\n\ng6-h7: moves king to h7.\n\nWhy? To get out of the way? But no immediate danger.\n\nBut note: **g7 pawn is on g7**, and if king moves to h7, then g7 is unprotected.\n\nWhite bishop on g5 could take g7? g5 \u2192 g7? That\u2019s vertical \u2014 no, bishop moves diagonally.\n\ng5 to g7 is same file \u2014 not diagonal. So **cannot capture**.\n\nBut g5 controls h6, f4, e3, d2, c1? Let's see:\n\ng5 (light square) \u2014 diagonal: a1-h8 direction? g5 \u2192 f6 \u2192 e7 \u2192 d8 (one diagonal), and g5 \u2192 h6 (other direction).\n\nSo g5 controls:\n- h6\n- f6\n- e7\n- d8\n- and down: f4, e3, d2, c1\n\nWait \u2014 **c1 is on the diagonal from g5?**\n\ng5 \u2192 f4 \u2192 e3 \u2192 d2 \u2192 c1 \u2014 yes! All light squares.\n\nSo **g5 bishop controls c1**!\n\nThat\u2019s critical.\n\nSo if Black plays **c2-c1=Q**, then White plays **Bxc1**, capturing the queen.\n\nSo **promotion is losing** \u2014 because bishop takes on c1.\n\nSo **c2c1q is a blunder** \u2014 loses the queen.\n\nSimilarly, **c2c1r** \u2014 rook on c1 \u2014 also gets taken by Bxc1.\n\nSame for **c2c1b** \u2014 bishop on c1 \u2014 Bxc1.\n\nEven **c2c"
