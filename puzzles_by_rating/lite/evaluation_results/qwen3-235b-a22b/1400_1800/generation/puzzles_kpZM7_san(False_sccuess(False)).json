When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/8/8/8/4kp2/2K4P/8/8 w - - 1 63\n```\n\nLet\u2019s interpret the position:\n\n- **White to move** (`w` in FEN)\n- **White King** is on c3\n- **White pawn** is on h3\n- **Black King** is on e4\n- **Black pawn** is on f4\n- No other pieces\n- It's move 63, so likely an endgame.\n\nCurrent position:\n\n```\n8\n8\n8\n8\n  4  k  p\n2 K     4 P\n8\n8\n```\n\nSo, visually:\n\n- White king: c3\n- Black king: e4\n- Black pawn: f4\n- White pawn: h3\n\nWhite has a pawn on h3, Black has a pawn on f4. The goal for White is to promote the h-pawn, but it's far from promotion. Black is trying to stop that and possibly promote their own f-pawn.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the **goal**:\n\n- White wants to push h3-h4-h5-h6-h7-h8=Q\n- But Black king is near the center and can potentially race to stop the h-pawn\n- However, the f4 pawn is also a threat \u2014 if White is not careful, Black might promote first\n\nBut note: **Black pawn on f4**, one step from f3 and then f2-f1=Q. So it's very close to queening.\n\nBut wait \u2014 it's **White to move**, so White gets a tempo.\n\nLet\u2019s assess the **race**:\n\n- Black pawn on f4, needs 4 moves to promote: f4 \u2192 f3 \u2192 f2 \u2192 f1=Q\n- But it's blocked? No \u2014 nothing is blocking f4-f3. But White can potentially capture it.\n\nWait \u2014 can White king reach f4 in time?\n\nWhite king is on c3. Distance to f4 is |file: c\u2192f = 3|, |rank: 3\u21924 = 1| \u2192 3 moves minimum (e.g., c3-d4-e5-f4). But Black can just push f4-f3-f2-f1.\n\nBut Black must move first? No \u2014 it's White to move now.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\nCurrent: Black king on e4, pawn on f4. White king on c3, pawn on h3.\n\nIf White does nothing, Black can play f4-f3, then f3-f2, etc.\n\nBut White has a **passed pawn** on h3, and Black\u2019s king is far from it.\n\nBut Black\u2019s pawn is much closer to promotion.\n\nSo the **key** is: **Can White stop the f-pawn while advancing the h-pawn?**\n\nAlternatively: **Can White sacrifice the h-pawn to stop the f-pawn?** No, because h-pawn is White\u2019s only chance.\n\nWait \u2014 actually, **White cannot stop the f-pawn unless the king gets involved**.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate:\n\nSuppose White plays **h4** now. Then:\n\n1. h4 f3  \n2. h5 f2  \n3. h6 f1=Q  \n4. h7 Qf3+  \n5. Kb4 or Kd4 \u2014 Black queens with check and likely wins.\n\nSo if White just pushes h-pawn, Black promotes first with check and wins.\n\nSo **h4 is bad**.\n\nSimilarly, **c3c4**, **c3b4**, **c3b3**, **c3d2**, **c3c2**, **c3b2**, **h3h4** are the legal moves.\n\nWe need to find the best.\n\nBut White must **stop the f4 pawn**.\n\nSo the **only way** is for the White king to **capture the f4 pawn**.\n\nSo the plan: **King goes to f4, captures the pawn, then deals with the rest.**\n\nBut can it get there in time?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- White king on c3 \u2192 needs to reach f4.\n- Minimum moves: c3 \u2192 d4 \u2192 e5 \u2192 f4 = 3 moves\n- But Black pawn on f4 can move f4-f3 in one move.\n\nSo if White plays, say, c3-d4, Black plays f4-f3.\n\nThen White e5, Black f3-f2.\n\nWhite f4 \u2014 but pawn already on f2, so too late.\n\nSo if White takes 3 moves to reach f4, Black promotes in 2 more moves after f4-f3.\n\nBut White moves first.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n**Position**: White to move.\n\nOption: **c3-d4** (not in legal moves \u2014 wait, legal moves are only: c3c4, c3b4, c3b3, c3d2, c3c2, c3b2, h3h4\n\nWait \u2014 **c3d4 is not legal?** Why?\n\nc3 to d4 \u2014 that\u2019s a king move, one square diagonally? Yes, but is it allowed?\n\nKing from c3 to d4: yes, one square diagonally \u2014 that should be legal.\n\nBut it's **not in the list of legal moves**.\n\nSo perhaps the engine or context says only these moves are legal.\n\nList: c3c4, c3b4, c3b3, c3d2, c3c2, c3b2, h3h4\n\nSo king can move:\n\n- c3-c4 (up)\n- c3-b4 (left-up)\n- c3-b3 (left)\n- c3-d2 (down-right)\n- c3-c2 (down)\n- c3-b2 (down-left)\n- h3-h4 (pawn push)\n\nSo missing: c3-d4, c3-d3 \u2014 probably because they are **offside** or blocked? But no pieces.\n\nWait \u2014 is d4 attacked? No, no pieces.\n\nBut perhaps the **rules** \u2014 king cannot move into check.\n\nIs d4 attacked?\n\nBlack king is on e4.\n\nSo e4 controls: d5, e5, f5, d4, f4, d3, e3, f3.\n\nYes! **d4 is adjacent to e4**, so **d4 is attacked by Black king**.\n\nTherefore, **White king cannot move to d4** \u2014 it would be in check.\n\nSimilarly, **d3, d2?** d2 is not adjacent to e4.\n\ne4 \u2192 d3 is adjacent (diagonally), so d3 is attacked.\n\nd2 is two files away and two ranks down \u2014 |e-d|=1, |4-2|=2 \u2192 not adjacent. So d2 is safe.\n\nSimilarly, c4: c4 is two files left, same rank \u2014 |c-e|=2, so not adjacent. c4 is safe.\n\nc3 to c4: c4 is not attacked by Black king on e4? Distance: e4 to c4 is two files apart \u2014 not adjacent. So safe.\n\nSimilarly, b4: b4 is two left, one up \u2014 |e-b|=3? e to b is 3 files \u2014 b, c, d, e \u2192 b is 3 away? No:\n\nFiles: a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5\n\nSo e4 to b4: file diff = 3, rank diff = 0 \u2192 not adjacent. So b4 is safe.\n\nb3: b3 \u2014 file diff |5-2|=3, rank |4-3|=1 \u2192 not adjacent.\n\nd2: d2 \u2014 file |5-4|=1, rank |4-2|=2 \u2192 not adjacent \u2192 safe.\n\nc2: c2 \u2014 file |5-3|=2, rank |4-2|=2 \u2192 not adjacent.\n\nb2: b2 \u2014 file |5-2|=3, rank |4-2|=2 \u2192 safe.\n\nSo all king moves listed are to safe squares.\n\nBut **d4 is attacked** (e4 to d4 is one diagonal), so c3-d4 is illegal.\n\nSimilarly, c3-d3: d3 is adjacent to e4 (diagonally), so attacked \u2014 illegal.\n\nc3-c4: c4 is not adjacent to e4 \u2014 safe.\n\nNow, back to plan.\n\nWhite must stop f4 pawn.\n\nf4 pawn can play f3 next, then f2, then f1=Q.\n\nIt takes **3 moves** for Black to promote: f4\u2192f3, f3\u2192f2, f2\u2192f1=Q.\n\nBut after f4-f3, the pawn is on f3, and if White king is on d2 or c2, maybe can capture?\n\nBut f3 is protected by Black king on e4.\n\nSo White king cannot capture f3 unless Black king moves away.\n\nBut Black king will stay near.\n\nSo the **only way** to stop the f-pawn is to **capture it on f4** before it moves.\n\nSo White king must reach f4 **before** Black plays f4-f3.\n\nBut it's White to move now.\n\nSo White has **one move** before Black plays f4-f3.\n\nCan White king get to f4 in one move from c3? No \u2014 too far.\n\nMinimum two moves: e.g., c3-d4 (illegal), or c3-c4, then c4-d5, etc.\n\nBut c3-c4 is possible.\n\nBut even then, after c3-c4, Black plays f4-f3"
