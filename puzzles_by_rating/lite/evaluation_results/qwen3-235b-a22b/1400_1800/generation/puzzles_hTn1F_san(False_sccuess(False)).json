When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Let's decode carefully.\n\nFEN breakdown (8th rank to 1st):\n\n```\n8: 2r2rk1 \u2192 _ _ r _ _ r k _\n7: 5ppp \u2192 _ _ _ _ _ p p p\n6: aqn1p3 \u2192 a q n _ p _ _ _\n5: 1p1pP1b1 \u2192 _ p _ p P _ b _\n4: 3P4 \u2192 _ _ _ P _ _ _ _\n3: 3NPB1P \u2192 _ _ _ N P B _ P\n2: PPRQ2P1 \u2192 P P R Q _ _ P _\n1: 5RK1 \u2192 _ _ _ _ _ R K _\n```\n\nSo corrected piece placement:\n\n- **Black**:\n  - King: g8\n  - Rooks: c8, f8\n  - Queen: b6\n  - Knight: c6\n  - Bishop: g5\n  - Pawns: a6, b5, d5, e6, f7, g7, h7\n\n- **White**:\n  - King: g1\n  - Rooks: c2, f1\n  - Queen: d2\n  - Bishop: f3\n  - Knight: d3\n  - Pawns: a2, b2, c2, d4, e3, f3, g2, h3\n\nWait \u2014 c2 is occupied by a rook, so pawns are a2, b2, and g2, h3. e3, d4.\n\nNow, **material**:\n- Material is roughly equal. No obvious material imbalances.\n\n**Key features**:\n\n- Black king is castled, but potentially vulnerable.\n- White has a bishop on f3, which is currently blocking the queen\u2019s diagonal.\n- Black has a strong bishop on g5, pinning the knight on f3? Wait \u2014 no knight on f3. White knight is on d3.\n- Black queen is on b6, eyeing d4 and potentially e3.\n- White has a pawn on e3, knight on d3, bishop on f3 \u2014 central pieces.\n- The e5 pawn is advanced, supported by d4 and e3.\n- Black has a knight on c6, queen on b6 \u2014 both targeting d5 and potentially e5.\n- White\u2019s c2 rook is semi-open on the c-file, but black has a rook on c8.\n- White\u2019s queen on d2 is somewhat passive, but supports e3 and d4.\n\nNow, **candidate moves**:\n\nLet\u2019s go through the most **tactically promising** ideas.\n\n### 1. **Is there a tactical shot?**\n\nLook at **f3h5** \u2014 bishop from f3 to h5.\n\nThat attacks the black bishop on g5? No \u2014 g5 is occupied by black bishop. So Bh5 would **capture** the bishop: **Bxg5**.\n\nWait \u2014 **f3h5** is Bf3 \u2192 h5, which is **Bxg5**, since black bishop is on g5.\n\nSo: **Bxg5** \u2014 is that good?\n\nAfter **Bxg5**, black recaptures with **hxg5** or **Qxg5**?\n\n- If **...hxg5**, then the h-file opens, but black king is on g8, so h-file is dangerous.\n- But white has rook on f1, queen on d2 \u2014 can they exploit the h-file?\n\nBut more importantly: what happens after **Bxg5**?\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\n**1. Bxg5 hxg5** (forced, otherwise black loses a piece for nothing)\n\nNow black has doubled g-pawns, but open h-file.\n\nBut now, white can play **Qd2xg5**, threatening mate on h6 or g7.\n\nWait \u2014 **Qd2-g5** is possible? Yes \u2014 d2 to g5 is diagonal, and no pieces in between.\n\nAfter **Bxg5 hxg5??**, then **Qxg5+**, and now:\n\n- **...Kf8** \u2014 only move\n- Then **Qh6+**, and mate follows: **Qh6+ Ke7, Qg7+ Ke8, Qg8#** or similar.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s check:\n\nAfter:\n\n1. Bxg5 hxg5  \n2. Qxg5+ Kf8  \n3. Qh6+ Ke7  \n4. Qg7+ Ke8  \n5. Qg8# \u2014 yes, mate.\n\nBut is **...hxg5** the only recapture?\n\nNo \u2014 black can recapture with the **queen**: **...Qxg5**\n\nSo:\n\n1. Bxg5 Qxg5  \n2. ??\n\nNow white has traded bishop for bishop, black queen recaptured.\n\nBut now, white can play **Rxg5**, since rook on c2 can go to c6? No \u2014 c2 to g5 is not possible.\n\nRook on c2 is on c2 \u2014 can it go to g2? No, not directly.\n\nWait \u2014 **c2c5** is a legal move \u2014 rook to c5.\n\nBut after **Bxg5 Qxg5**, white has no immediate follow-up.\n\nBut more importantly: **after Bxg5 Qxg5**, black has removed the pin (if any), but actually there was no pin.\n\nBut now, white has lost a bishop, black queen is active.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: is **Bxg5** safe?\n\nWait \u2014 after **Bxg5**, if black plays **...Qxg5**, then white can play **Nf4!**, attacking the queen.\n\nYes!\n\nSo:\n\n1. Bxg5 Qxg5  \n2. Nf4\n\nNow the knight on d3 jumps to f4, attacking the queen.\n\nBlack must move the queen, and white gains time.\n\nFor example:\n- 2... Qf5 (only safe square)  \n- Then white can play **Rc5**, threatening c6, or **Qd3**, centralizing.\n\nAlso, the knight on f4 is very strong \u2014 eyes g6, e6, d5.\n\nSo **Bxg5** leads to either:\n\n- **...hxg5?? Qxg5+ Kf8 Qh6+ Ke7 Qg7+ Ke8 Qg8#** \u2014 mate\n- **...Qxg5 Nf4**, winning a tempo and gaining initiative\n\nSo **Bxg5** is **very strong** \u2014 it\u2019s a **winning tactic** if black takes with the pawn.\n\nBut black will of course play **...Qxg5**, avoiding mate.\n\nStill, after **...Qxg5 Nf4**, white gains a strong initiative, knight becomes dominant, and black queen is harassed.\n\nSo **f3h5** (Bxg5) is a **very strong candidate**.\n\nNow, are there **better** moves?\n\nLet\u2019s check other options.\n\n### 2. **d3f4** \u2014 Nf4\n\nThis is similar \u2014 knight to f4, attacking g5 bishop.\n\nBut after **Nf4**, black can play **...Bxf4**, exchanging.\n\nThen **exf4**, and white has doubled f-pawns, but controls e5.\n\nBut black has removed the knight, and white didn\u2019t gain much.\n\nCompare to **Bxg5**, which forces the issue.\n\n**Nf4** is good, but **Bxg5** is more forcing and leads to better play.\n\n### 3. **d3e1**, **d3c1**, etc. \u2014 retreating knight \u2014 clearly worse.\n\n### 4. **d2b4** \u2014 queen to b4\n\nAttacks b5 pawn, and eyes d5.\n\nBut black can play **...Na5**, blocking, or **...Qc6**, defending.\n\nNot very forcing.\n\n### 5. **c2c6** \u2014 rook takes on c6?\n\nc2 to c6 \u2014 is that possible?\n\nRook on c2, c6 has black knight.\n\nSo **Rxc6**?\n\nBut after **Rxc6**, black plays **Qxc6**, and now white\u2019s queen is hanging? No \u2014 queen on d2.\n\nBut black queen is now on c6, attacking d4 and e4.\n\nBut white can play **Qxb5**, winning a pawn.\n\nBut then **...Qc1+**, skewering king and rook?\n\nAfter:\n\n1. Rc6 Qxc6  \n2. Qxb5 Qc1+  \n3. Kg2 Qc2+  \n"
