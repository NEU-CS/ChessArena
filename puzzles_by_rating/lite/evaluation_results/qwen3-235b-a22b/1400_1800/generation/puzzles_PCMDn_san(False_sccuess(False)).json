When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Positional Overview**\n\n- **White's king** is on g2.\n- **Black's king** is on g8 \u2014 relatively safe for now, but not fully sheltered.\n- Material is roughly equal, but both sides have vulnerabilities.\n\n#### **White\u2019s pieces:**\n- **Queen on c2**\n- **Rook on e3 and a1**\n- **Bishop on d1**\n- **Pawns on a3, b2, e3, f4, pawns on f- and e-file connected? Wait: e3 is occupied by a rook. So pawns: a3, b2, f4. Also, f4 is a central pawn, e3 is blocked by rook.**\n- Wait: **e3 has a rook**, so no e-pawn. Pawns: a3, b2, f4. Also, **b2** is a potential weakness.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s reconstruct the board from the FEN:\n\n```\n8:  -  -  -  -  -  -  k  -     (6k1)\n7:  -  p  -  -  -  -  b  -     (1p4b1)\n6:  a  -  -  -  -  -  p  -     (a5p1p1 \u2192 a6, g6)\n5:  -  -  -  q  -  p  -  -     (3q1p2)\n4:  -  -  -  -  -  P  -  p     (5P1p \u2192 f4, h4)\n3:  P  -  -  -  P  R  -  -     (P3PR2 \u2192 a3, e3, f3? Wait: e3 is rook, so e3 is occupied. f3? No \u2014 P3PR2 means: P, then 3 empty, P, R, then 2 empty \u2192 a3, e3, f3? But f3 is not mentioned. Wait, no: \"P3PR2\" = P _ _ _ P R _ _ \u2192 so a3 and e3? But e3 is already a rook. Wait, no \u2014 the rook is separate.\n\nWait, better to parse the FEN properly.\n\nFEN: `6k1/1p4b1/p5p1/3q1p2/5P1p/P3PR2/1PQ3K1/R1Br4 w - - 0 30`\n\nLet\u2019s go row by row (rank 8 to 1):\n\n**Rank 8:** `6k1` \u2192 6 empty, K on g8, 1 empty \u2192 so g8: black king\n\n**Rank 7:** `1p4b1` \u2192 1 empty, b7: black pawn, 4 empty, g7: black bishop, 1 empty \u2192 b7, g7\n\n**Rank 6:** `a5p1p1` \u2192 a6: black pawn, 5 empty, g6: black pawn, 1 empty \u2192 a6, g6\n\n**Rank 5:** `3q1p2` \u2192 3 empty, d5: black queen, 1 empty, f5: black pawn, 2 empty \u2192 d5, f5\n\n**Rank 4:** `5P1p` \u2192 5 empty, f4: white pawn, 1 empty, h4: black pawn \u2192 f4, h4\n\n**Rank 3:** `P3PR2` \u2192 a3: white pawn, 3 empty, e3: white pawn? No \u2014 P3PR2 \u2192 P _ _ _ P R _ _ \u2192 so a3: white pawn, e3: white pawn? But then R on f3? But the piece is R \u2014 rook. But in the next part, we have e3 already? Wait \u2014 no, this is rank 3.\n\nWait: `P3PR2` \u2192 P (a3), then 3 empty (b3,c3,d3), then P (e3)? But then R (f3), then 2 empty (g3,h3). But in the next rank, we have c2 queen, so e3 is likely the rook.\n\nWait \u2014 no: `P3PR2` \u2014 the \"P\" could be pawn, \"R\" rook.\n\nSo: a3: white pawn, e3: white pawn? But then f3: white rook?\n\nBut in the next rank (rank 2): `1PQ3K1` \u2192 b2: white pawn, c2: white queen, g2: white king.\n\nAnd rank 1: `R1Br4` \u2192 a1: white rook, c1: white bishop, d1: white rook? Wait: R1Br4 \u2192 R _ B r _ _ _ _ \u2192 but r is black rook? No \u2014 case matters: uppercase is white, lowercase black.\n\nSo: `R1Br4` \u2192 R (a1, white rook), 1 empty (b1), B (c1, white bishop), r (d1, black rook?), then 4 empty.\n\nWait \u2014 d1 has a **black rook**? That can\u2019t be \u2014 black rook deep in white\u2019s position?\n\nWait: `R1Br4` \u2014 R (a1, white rook), 1 empty (b1), B (c1, white bishop), r (d1, black rook), then 4 empty.\n\nYes \u2014 **d1 has a black rook**.\n\nBut that seems odd \u2014 but possible.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s double-check:\n\nFEN: `6k1/1p4b1/p5p1/3q1p2/5P1p/P3PR2/1PQ3K1/R1Br4 w - - 0 30`\n\nSo:\n\n- **a1**: R (white rook)\n- **b1**: empty\n- **c1**: B (white bishop)\n- **d1**: r (black rook) \u2190 yes, black rook on d1\n- e1\u2013h1: empty\n\nSo black has a rook on d1 \u2014 that\u2019s deep in white\u2019s territory. How did it get there? But it\u2019s there.\n\nNow rank 3: `P3PR2` \u2192 a3 (P), b3\u2013d3 empty, e3 (P), f3 (R), g3\u2013h3 empty\n\nSo:\n- a3: white pawn\n- e3: white pawn\n- f3: white rook\n\nWait \u2014 but earlier I thought e3 was a rook \u2014 no, in FEN, `P3PR2` \u2014 the \"P\" at e3 is a **pawn**, and \"R\" at f3 is a **rook**.\n\nBut in the string: `P3PR2` \u2014 positions: a3=P, e3=P, f3=R\n\nSo:\n- **e3**: white pawn\n- **f3**: white rook\n\nBut then what about the rook on e3 in the FEN? No \u2014 the FEN says `P3PR2`, so rook is on f3.\n\nBut in the initial description, it said `e3e4` is a legal move \u2014 which would make sense only if there is a piece on e3.\n\nWait \u2014 **e3e4** is in the legal moves list. So the piece on e3 must be movable.\n\nBut if e3 is a **pawn**, then e3e4 is a legal pawn move.\n\nYes \u2014 so e3 is a white pawn.\n\nSo:\n- **e3**: white pawn\n- **f3**: white rook\n\nBut the FEN says `P3PR2` \u2014 that\u2019s a3 (P), then 3 empty (b3,c3,d3), then e3 (P), f3 (R), then 2 empty (g3,h3). Yes.\n\nSo:\n- White pawn on e3\n- White rook on f3\n\nBut in the FEN it's written as `P3PR2` \u2014 yes, that\u2019s correct.\n\nSo summary:\n\n### **White pieces:**\n- King: g2\n- Queen: c2\n- Rooks: f3 (on f3), a1\n- Bishop: c1\n- Pawns: a3, b2, e3, f4\n\nWait \u2014 f4 is also a pawn. So pawns: a3, b2, e3, f4\n\nBut in rank 4: `5P1p` \u2192 f4: white pawn\n\nYes.\n\n### **Black pieces:**\n- King: g8\n- Queen: d5\n- Bishop: g7\n- Rook: d1 (black rook on d1 \u2014 very deep!)\n- Pawns: a6, b7, f5, g6, h4, h7? Wait \u2014 h4 is black pawn (from `5P1p` \u2192 h4 black), and g6, f5, b7, a6.\n\nAlso, h4 is black pawn.\n\nNow, **Black has"
