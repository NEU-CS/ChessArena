When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material and Positional Overview**\n\n**Material:**\n- Both sides have equal material: each has king, rook, two minor pieces (White: Bf3, Be3, Nf3, Nf2; Black: likely Bc7, Bd5 or similar), pawns.\n- White has a knight on f3 and f2, bishop on e3, Black has queen on e5, rook on f8, etc.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s reconstruct the board from the FEN:\n\n```\n8:  5rk1  \u2192 _ _ _ _ _ r k _\n7:  abp3pp \u2192 a p b p _ _ _ _ (wait, no \u2014 FEN uses symbols)\nActually:\n8:  - - - - - r k -\n7:  p b p - - - g p  \u2192 p b p _ _ _ g p? No \u2014 \"abp3pp\" is not right.\n\nWait, correct interpretation:\n\nFEN: `5rk1/pbp3pp/8/2pqp3/8/3PBN2/PPP2NPP/R4RK1 w - - 4 20`\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\n**Rank 8:** `5rk1` \u2192 5 empty, then r, k, 1 empty \u2192 `_ _ _ _ _ r k _`\n**Rank 7:** `pbp3pp` \u2192 p, b, p, 3 empty, p, p \u2192 `p b p _ _ _ p p`\n**Rank 6:** `8` \u2192 all empty\n**Rank 5:** `2pqp3` \u2192 2 empty, p, q, p, 3 empty \u2192 `_ _ p q p _ _ _`\n**Rank 4:** `8` \u2192 all empty\n**Rank 3:** `3PBN2` \u2192 3 empty, P, B, N, 2 empty \u2192 `_ _ _ P B N _ _`\n**Rank 2:** `PPP2NPP` \u2192 P, P, P, _, _, N, P, P \u2192 `P P P _ _ N P P`\n**Rank 1:** `R4RK1` \u2192 R, 4 empty, R, K, 1 empty \u2192 `R _ _ _ _ R K _`\n\nSo the board is:\n\n```\n  a b c d e f g h\n8 r _ _ _ _ r k _  \u2190 Black\n7 p b p _ _ _ p p\n6 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n5 _ _ p q p _ _ _\n4 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n3 _ _ _ P B N _ _\n2 P P P _ _ N P P\n1 R _ _ _ _ R K _  \u2190 White\n```\n\nWait \u2014 rank 7: `pbp3pp` \u2192 p, b, p, _, _, _, p, p \u2192 so a7=p, b7=b, c7=p, f7=p, g7=p, h7=p \u2192 yes.\n\nSo Black\u2019s pieces:\n- King: g8\n- Rook: f8\n- Queen: e5\n- Bishop: b7\n- Pawns: a7, c7, c5, e5, f7, g7, h7\n\nWhite\u2019s pieces:\n- King: g1\n- Rooks: a1, f1\n- Knights: f3, f2\n- Bishop: e3\n- Pawns: a2, b2, c2, d3, g2, h2, f2 (f2 is knight), so pawns on a2, b2, c2, d3, g2, h2\n\nWait \u2014 rank 2: `PPP2NPP` \u2192 a2=P, b2=P, c2=P, d2=_, e2=_, f2=N, g2=P, h2=P\n\nSo White pawns: a2, b2, c2, d3, g2, h2\n\nNow, Black queen is on e5, which is central and active.\n\nWhite has a bishop on e3, knight on f3, knight on f2, bishop on e3 \u2014 wait, e3 is occupied by White bishop.\n\nBlack has a pawn on e5, which is attacked by White bishop on e3? e3-e5 is diagonal? e3 to e5 is vertical \u2014 no.\n\ne3 is light-squared bishop? e3 to d4, c5, f4, g5 \u2014 yes, diagonal.\n\nBut e5 is on same diagonal? e3 to e5 is vertical \u2014 no, not diagonal. e3 is light square, e5 is dark. So bishop on e3 (light-squared) cannot attack e5 (dark).\n\nBut bishop on e3 can go to f4, g5, d4, c5.\n\nWait \u2014 Black has a pawn on c5, and queen on e5.\n\nWhite knight on f3 can go to e5? f3-e5 is possible if not blocked.\n\nf3 to e5: f3 \u2192 e5 is a knight move (one back, two left? f3 to e5 is up one, left one \u2014 no.\n\nKnight moves: from f3:\n- g5, e5, d4, d2, e1, h4 \u2014 yes, e5 is a knight move: f3 \u2192 e5 is (file -1, rank +2)? f to e is -1, 3 to 5 is +2 \u2192 yes, L-shape.\n\nSo **Nf3 can capture on e5**.\n\nSimilarly, bishop on e3 can go to c5? e3 to c5: e\u2192c (-2), 3\u21925 (+2) \u2192 diagonal? yes, c5 is two back, two left \u2014 so yes, diagonal. e3-c5 is a valid diagonal.\n\nc5 has a Black pawn.\n\nSo White has:\n- Nf3 attacking e5 (queen)\n- Be3 attacking c5 (pawn)\n\nBlack queen on e5 is attacked by Nf3.\n\nIs it defended?\n\nBlack queen on e5: what defends it?\n\n- d5? no piece on d5\n- f5? empty\n- d6? empty\n- f6? empty\n- c5? pawn, but not defending e5\n- e6? empty\n- e4? empty\n- f4? empty\n- d4? empty\n\nNo Black piece is defending the queen on e5.\n\nSo **White can play Nf3xe5**, winning a queen.\n\nIs that legal? Let\u2019s see: f3e5 is in the legal moves list.\n\nYes: `f3e5` is in the list.\n\nNow, is it safe?\n\nAfter `f3e5`, Black can recapture?\n\nWhat captures on e5?\n\n- d6? no piece\n- f6? no\n- d4? no\n- f4? no\n- c6? no\n- g4? no\n\nNo Black piece can recapture immediately.\n\nBlack\u2019s knight? Where is Black\u2019s knight? Not visible \u2014 probably captured or undeveloped.\n\nBlack has no knight on the board shown \u2014 only rook, queen, bishop, king, pawns.\n\nSo Black has no minor pieces developed \u2014 only bishop on b7.\n\nSo after `f3e5`, Black loses queen for free.\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check: is e5 defended?\n\nQueen on e5 \u2014 is it pinned? No.\n\nCan Black move the queen? Yes, but if White plays Nf3-e5, it\u2019s a capture.\n\nSo **Nf3xe5 wins a queen**.\n\nIs there any risk?\n\nCould Black deliver check after that?\n\nAfter `f3e5`, Black to move.\n\nBlack has:\n- Can play Qe5-f6? But queen is captured.\n- So Black has no queen.\n\nBlack\u2019s move: they lost queen.\n\nThey can play, say, ...c5-c4? or ...b7-b5? or ...Rf8-e8? etc.\n\nBut White is up a queen.\n\nSo this seems winning.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is the knight on f3 pinned?\n\nIs the king on g1 in check if knight moves?\n\nNo \u2014 no piece attacks along the f-file or diagonals to f3.\n\nBishop on b7: b7 to f3? b7-g2 diagonal? b7 to f3: b\u2192f (+4), 7\u21923 (-4) \u2192 yes, diagonal.\n\nb7 is dark square, f3 is dark square \u2014 yes, same diagonal.\n\nSo **bishop on b7 attacks f3**.\n\nAnd knight on f3 is on f"
