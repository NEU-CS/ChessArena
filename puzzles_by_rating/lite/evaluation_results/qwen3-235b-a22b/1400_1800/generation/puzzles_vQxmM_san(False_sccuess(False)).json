When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Material and Positional Overview**\n\n**Black's pieces:**\n- King on g7\n- Rooks: f8, f6 (but f6 is actually a bishop \u2014 wait, let's decode the board correctly)\n\nWait \u2014 let's reconstruct the board from the FEN:\n\n```\n8:  5 r r 1   \u2192 5 empty, Rook, Rook, 1 empty \u2192 [_, _, _, _, _, R, R, _]\n7:  1p2q1k1   \u2192 [_, p, _, _, q, _, k, _]\n6:  4nbp1     \u2192 [_, _, _, _, n, b, p, _]\n5:  p1p1p2p    \u2192 [p, _, p, _, p, _, _, p]\n4:  A2PdP2H    \u2192 [A, _, P, P, _, _, P, N] \u2014 wait, better to parse properly\n```\n\nLet\u2019s write the board row by row (rank 8 to 1):\n\n```\n8:  -  -  -  -  -  r  r  -   (5rr1)\n7:  -  p  -  -  q  -  k  -   (1p2q1k1)\n6:  -  -  -  -  n  b  p  -   (4nbp1)\n5:  p  -  p  -  p  -  -  p   (p1p1p2p)\n4:  A  -  P  P  -  -  P  N   (A2PP2PN \u2192 a2PdP2hN? No \u2014 \"A\" is 'a', so: a4, then 2 empty, d4, e4, 2 empty, h4, g3? No.)\n\nWait \u2014 FEN is:\n5rr1/1p2q1k1/4nbp1/p1p1p2p/P2pP2P/1QPP2PN/1P3RB1/5RK1\n\nSo:\n\nRank 8: 5rr1 \u2192 5 spaces, r, r, 1 space \u2192 [_, _, _, _, _, r, r, _]\nRank 7: 1p2q1k1 \u2192 [_, p, _, _, q, _, k, _]\nRank 6: 4nbp1 \u2192 [_, _, _, _, n, b, p, _]\nRank 5: p1p1p2p \u2192 [p, _, p, _, p, _, _, p]\nRank 4: P2pP2P \u2192 [P, _, _, p, P, _, _, P] \u2014 wait, no: \"P2pP2P\" \u2192 P, _, _, p, P, _, _, P? But that's 8 squares? Let's count:\n\n\"P\" (1), \"2\" (2 empty), \"p\" (1), \"P\" (1), \"2\" (2 empty), \"P\" (1) \u2192 1+2+1+1+2+1 = 8 \u2192 [P, _, _, p, P, _, _, P]\n\nBut the FEN says: **P2pP2P** \u2192 yes \u2192 a4=P, d4=p, e4=P, h4=P\n\nWait \u2014 d4=p (black pawn)? But d4 is occupied by a black pawn?\n\nBut in the next part: /1QPP2PN \u2192 that's rank 3\n\nRank 3: 1QPP2PN \u2192 [_, Q, P, P, _, _, P, N]\n\nRank 2: 1P3RB1 \u2192 [_, P, _, _, _, R, B, _]\n\nRank 1: 5RK1 \u2192 [_, _, _, _, R, K, _, _]\n\nSo full board:\n\n```\n   a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n8: -  -  -  -  -  r  r  -\n7: -  p  -  -  q  -  k  -\n6: -  -  -  -  n  b  p  -\n5: p  -  p  -  p  -  -  p\n4: P  -  -  p  P  -  -  P\n3: -  Q  P  P  -  -  P  N\n2: -  P  -  -  -  R  B  -\n1: -  -  -  -  R  K  -  -\n```\n\nNow, let's identify key pieces.\n\n**Black to move.**\n\n---\n\n### **2. Key Observations**\n\n- **Black king on g7**, relatively exposed but not immediately in check.\n- **White king on f1**, also somewhat exposed, but behind pawns.\n- **White has a bishop on g2**, rook on f2, rook on f1, queen on b3, knight on h3, pawns on a4, c3, d3, e4, f3, g3, h4.\n- **Black has queen on e7**, knight on e6, bishop on f6, pawns on a5, b7, c5, d4, e5, f6, g6, h5.\n\nWait \u2014 d4 is a **black pawn**? Yes \u2014 d4 is black pawn (from FEN: P2pP2P \u2192 d4=p).\n\nBut d4 is deep in white's territory \u2014 that pawn is advanced.\n\nAlso, **c5** is black pawn, **d4** is black pawn \u2014 so isolated pawn on d4, possibly weak.\n\nBut **White has a pawn on c3 and d3**, so d4 is blocked.\n\nNow, **Black has a strong center** with pawns on d4 and e5, but d4 is under pressure.\n\n**White queen on b3** \u2014 this is **very dangerous**. It\u2019s pointing at **f7**, which is a classic weak square.\n\nBut more importantly: **b3 queen is attacking d5**, and also **b3-g8 diagonal** \u2014 but g8 is empty.\n\nWait \u2014 **b3 queen is pointing at g8**, but more importantly: **b3 is attacking f7**, and **f7 is defended only by the king?**\n\nLet\u2019s check f7:\n\n- f7 has a black rook? No \u2014 f8 is rook, f7 is empty? From board:\n\nf8: rook\nf7: empty (from 1p2q1k1 \u2192 f7 is empty)\ng7: king\nh7: empty\n\nSo f7 is **empty**.\n\nBut **White queen on b3** is pointing along the b3-f7 diagonal. Is f7 attacked?\n\nb3 \u2192 c4 \u2192 d5 \u2192 e6 \u2192 f7\n\ne6 has a black knight.\n\nSo the **queen is blocked by the knight on e6**.\n\nSo no immediate threat.\n\nBut if the knight moves, f7 becomes vulnerable.\n\nAlso, **White has a bishop on g2**, which is pointing at f1, but also along the long diagonal: g2-a8.\n\nCurrently, g2 sees f3, e4, d5, c6, b7, a8.\n\nb7 has a black pawn, so not a direct threat.\n\nBut **g2 is supporting the center**.\n\nWhite has a **rook on f2**, **rook on f1**, so heavy pressure on the f-file.\n\nBlack also has **rooks on f8 and f6** \u2014 so **doubled rooks on the f-file**, but f6 is occupied by a rook? Wait \u2014 no:\n\nFrom FEN: f6 is a **bishop**? Wait \u2014 4nbp1 \u2192 e6=n, f6=b, g6=p\n\nSo f6 is **black bishop**, not rook.\n\nf8 is rook, g8 is rook.\n\nSo rooks on f8 and g8.\n\nf6 is **bishop**, e6 is knight.\n\nSo Black\u2019s pieces:\n- King: g7\n- Queen: e7\n- Rooks: f8, g8\n- Bishop: f6\n- Knight: e6\n- Pawns: a5, b7, c5, d4, e5, f6, g6, h5\n\nWhite\u2019s pieces:\n- King: f1\n- Queen: b3\n- Rooks: f1, f2\n- Bishop: g2\n- Knight: h3\n- Pawns: a4, c3, d3, e4, f3, g3, h4\n\n---\n\n### **3. Tactical and Strategic Ideas**\n\n#### **Black\u2019s threats:**\n- **d4 pawn** is advanced but may be weak. It\u2019s supported by e5, but attacked by c3 and e4.\n- **e5 and d4** form a pawn duo, but d4 is isolated now.\n- **Queen on e7** is well-placed, covering e"
