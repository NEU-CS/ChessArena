When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\nr1q1kbnr/pppb1ppp/2n1p3/8/2BP1B2/1Q2P3/PP3PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 3 7\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLet\u2019s first **analyze the position** step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Positional Overview**\n\n**White\u2019s pieces:**\n- King on e1\n- Queen on b3\n- Rooks on a1 and h1\n- Knights on b1 and g1\n- Bishops on c4 and f4\n- Pawns on a2, b2, d4, e3, f2, g2, h2\n\n**Black\u2019s pieces:**\n- King on e8\n- Queen on c8\n- Rooks on a8 and h8\n- Knights on c6 and g8\n- Bishops on d7 and f8\n- Pawns on a7, b7, c7, d7, e6, f7, g7, h7\n\n**Material:** Equal.\n\n**Center:** White has a strong center with pawns on d4 and e3. Black has e6, which is solid but not as aggressive.\n\n**Development:** Both sides are fairly developed. White has both bishops out, queen active, knights ready to jump. Black has knights on c6/g8, bishops on d7/f8 (f8 not yet developed), queen on c8.\n\n**King safety:** White has not castled yet, king is in the center. However, the knight on g1 blocks kingside castling (for now). Black also hasn\u2019t castled.\n\n**Tension:** The white bishop on c4 is eyeing f7, and the queen on b3 is targeting b7 and potentially e6. The bishop on f4 is very active.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Candidate Moves Analysis**\n\nWe are given a list of legal moves. Let\u2019s go through the most **tactically and strategically promising** ones.\n\n#### **A. TACTICAL SHOTS:**\n\nLet\u2019s look for **tactics** \u2014 forks, pins, skewers, discovered attacks, or immediate material gain.\n\n##### **1. f4xg7?** \u2014 Not legal (no capture on g7 listed). But wait \u2014 is **f4h6** possible?\n\nYes, **f4h6** is in the list. Let\u2019s check:\n\n- **Bf4-h6**: Attacks h7, and if Black is not careful, could threaten gxh6 and Qxh7#. But h7 is defended by g7 and h8 rook.\n\nBut more importantly: **Is there a discovered attack?**\n\nWait \u2014 what about **Bf4-e5**? Or **Bf4-g5**?\n\nLet\u2019s look at:\n\n##### **2. f4e5!?**\n\n- Bf4-e5 attacks e6. Black\u2019s e6 pawn is defended only by the d7 bishop and the c6 knight.\n- But if we play Be5, is it attacked? d6 is empty, so no immediate capture.\n- But more importantly: **Is there a pin or threat?**\n\nWait \u2014 **c4e6!** is in the list.\n\n##### **3. c4e6!!** \u2014 This looks very strong.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze **c4e6**:\n\n- Bishop takes on e6: **Bxe6**\n- Black\u2019s pawn on e6 is defended by the knight on c6 and the d7 bishop.\n- But after **Bxe6**, what happens?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- If **Bxe6**, then:\n  - Black can recapture with **fxe6**, but then **Qxg7** is mate threat!\n  - Wait: **Qb3-b8+**? No, queen is on b3.\n\nWait \u2014 **after Bxe6**, what is the position?\n\n- After **Bxe6**, Black must respond.\n\nPossible recaptures:\n- **f7xe6**: Then **Qb3-b8+!** \u2014 check!\n  - King cannot take (no), rook on a8 blocks, but **Rd8**? No, d8 is empty.\n  - After **Qb8+**, Black must play **Qc8-b8** or **Kd8**?\n    - **Kd8?** Then **Rd1+!** or **Ne2-d4**, but not immediate mate.\n    - But **Qc8xb8**? Then **Rd1+** \u2014 but not forced mate.\n\nWait \u2014 better: **after Bxe6 fxe6**, **Qb3-b8+!**\n\n- **Qb8+ forces Qxb8** (only move, since Kd8?? loses queen to Rd1+)\n- Then **Rd1+** \u2014 but Black plays **Kf8**, and we have **Rd8+**, but Black recaptures.\n\nWait \u2014 not winning.\n\nBut what if Black recaptures with **Nc6xe7**?\n\n- **Bxe6 Nxe7** \u2014 then **Qb3-b8+!** again\n  - **Qc8xb8** \u2192 **Rd1+ Ke8** \u2192 **Rd8#**? No, rook on d1, not d8.\n\nWait \u2014 **Rd1+** after Qxb8:\n- **Rd1+ Kf8**, then **Rd8+** \u2014 but Black has **Rxd8**, so no mate.\n\nSo not forced mate.\n\nBut **Bxe6** still looks strong \u2014 it **sacrifices the bishop for long-term initiative**, but is it sound?\n\nWait \u2014 what about **f4h6**?\n\n##### **4. f4h6**\n\n- Bf4-h6: attacks h7.\n- If Black doesn\u2019t respond, **gxh6 Qxh6 Qg3+** and mate on h2 or h7.\n- But Black can play **g7-g6**, kicking the bishop.\n- Then bishop retreats, and we\u2019ve lost tempo.\n\nBut what if we **double on h7**?\n\nWait \u2014 **Qb3-b7** is also a legal move.\n\n##### **5. b3b7!**\n\n- Qb3-b7: attacks b7 pawn, which is defended only by a7 and c7.\n- But **b7 is pinned** to the king? No, king is on e8.\n\nBut after **Qb7**, Black must respond:\n- **Qc8-b8** \u2014 only way to defend b7?\n- Then we play **Bf4-h6**, and now **gxh6??** allows **Qg7#**!\n- So Black must play **g6** or **Rg8**, etc.\n\nBut after **Qb7 Qb8**, then **Bh6**, Black plays **g6**, and we retreat.\n\nStill, **Qb7** wins a pawn: **if Black doesn\u2019t respond, Qxb7** wins the pawn.\n\nBut is b7 defended?\n\n- a7 pawn defends b7.\n- So **Qxb7** would be **Qxb7**, and **Rxa7**? Then we have **Rxa7**, but Black has **Qc8-b8**, attacking rook.\n\nSo **Qxb7 Rxa7 Qb8**, and we lose the queen unless we defend.\n\nBut we can play **Qb5**, forking b7 and e8?\n\nWait \u2014 not helpful.\n\nSo **Qb7** wins a pawn only if Black doesn\u2019t defend.\n\nBut Black can play **a6** or **Qb8**.\n\nSo not decisive.\n\nBut now, back to **c4e6** \u2014 is there a **discovered attack**?\n\nWait \u2014 what if we play **d4-d5!**?\n\n##### **6. d4d5!!**\n\nThis is a **very strong candidate**.\n\n- d4-d5: opens the center, attacks e6.\n- Now, **if exd5**, then **Bf4xc7!** \u2014 winning the queen!\n  - Because **Bxc7**, and **Qxc7??** allows **Qb3-b8+!** \u2014 check!\n    - **Qc8xb8** \u2192 **Rd1+ Ke8** \u2192 **Rd8#**? No, Rd1+ Kf8, then Rd8+ Rxd8, not mate.\n    - But **Qb8+** forces **Qxb8**, and then **Rd1+** \u2014 Black must play **Kf8**, then **Rd8+** \u2014 but again, not mate.\n\nWait \u2014 but **after d5 exd5 Bxc7**, Black cannot take the bishop because **Qb8+** wins the queen.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- **1. d5 exd5**\n- **2. Bxc7! Qxc7??**\n- **3. Qb8+! Qc8xb8**\n- **4. Rd1+ Ke8**\n- **5. Rd8#**\n\nYes! **Checkmate!**\n\nSo if Black recaptures the bishop with the queen, it\u2019s **mate in 3**.\n\nSo Black **cannot take** on c7.\n\nTherefore, after **d5 exd5**, if Black doesn\u2019t take Bxc7, then **Bxc7** wins the queen.\n\nBut what if Black doesn\u2019t take on d5?\n\nAfter **d5**, Black has:\n\n- **exd5** \u2014 leads to **Bxc7!**, and if **Qxc7"
