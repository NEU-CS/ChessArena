If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/p1p2pp1/5bqk/3Q1R1p/3P3P/1PP2PB1/5P1K/1r6 b - - 12 37\n```\n\nThis means:\n- It's **Black's move** (since the turn indicator is `b`).\n- We must choose the best move from the provided list of legal moves.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Position\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the key elements of the position.\n\n#### Key Pieces:\n\n- **Black King**: on h6 \u2014 very exposed, near the edge.\n- **White King**: on h2 \u2014 relatively safe.\n- **Black Queen**: on g6 \u2014 attacking and active.\n- **White Queen**: on d5 \u2014 central and dangerous.\n- **White Rook**: on f5 \u2014 also very active, controlling the 5th rank and aiming at h5 and potentially the king.\n- **White Bishop**: on g3 \u2014 developed, eyeing the long diagonal.\n- **Black Bishop**: on f6 \u2014 well-placed, controls central diagonals.\n- **Black Rook**: on b1 \u2014 passive, but potentially dangerous if activated.\n- **White pawns**: d4, c3, b3, h4, f2, etc.\n- **Black pawns**: a7, c7, f7, g7, h5.\n\n#### Immediate Tactical Observations:\n\n- The **Black king is on h6**, with **White Rook on f5** and **White Queen on d5**. Is there a mating net forming?\n\nLet\u2019s see if the king is in danger:\n\n- **Rf5** controls g5, h5, and the h-file indirectly.\n- **Qd5** can potentially go to h1, g5, or f7.\n- **Bg3** is pointing at h2, but more importantly, it supports e5 and f4.\n\nBut more importantly \u2014 **Black has a queen on g6**, which is **attacking the White king on h2** along the g-file? No \u2014 the g-file is blocked by pawns.\n\nWait: **Qg6** \u2014 it's on g6, king on h6 \u2014 so the queen is **pinned to the king along the 6th rank**? No, because the king is on h6, queen on g6 \u2014 same rank.\n\nBut **White has a rook on f5**, which is on the 5th rank.\n\nWait \u2014 is **Qg6** attacking anything?\n\nYes:\n- It **attacks the White bishop on g3** \u2014 because g6\u2013g3 is along the g-file.\n- So **Qg6 is attacking Bg3**.\n\nBut **White can play Qxg6?** Only if it's safe.\n\nLet\u2019s see: **Qd5\u2013g5** would attack the queen on g6. Is that possible?\n\nYes \u2014 **Qd5\u2013g5** is a threat: **attacking the queen on g6**, and also **attacking the king on h6** via discovered attack if the queen moves.\n\nWait \u2014 **Qg5** would attack both the queen and deliver check? No \u2014 from g5, queen would be on same diagonal as h6? Yes \u2014 g5 to h6 is adjacent diagonal.\n\nSo **Qd5\u2013g5** is **check** and also attacks the queen.\n\nBut it's **White's move next**, not now \u2014 it's **Black's move now**.\n\nSo Black must **prevent immediate threats**.\n\nLet\u2019s assess: **Is Qg5+ a threat?**\n\nYes \u2014 if Black does nothing, White can play **Qg5+**, check, and win the queen: **Qg5+ Qxg5 hxg5+ Kxg5?? Rf5+!** \u2014 but actually, after Qg5+, Black **must** capture or move king.\n\nAfter **Qg5+**, Black has:\n- **Kxg5?** \u2014 but then **Rf5+** skewers king and queen? Wait \u2014 no queen anymore.\n\nWait: **Qg5+**, Black king on h6:\n- **Kg8?** \u2014 but h6 to g8 is not legal.\n- Legal king moves from h6: **g6, h7, g7**.\n\nSo:\n- **Kh7** \u2014 escapes.\n- **Kg6** \u2014 into the queen\u2019s way?\n- **h6\u2013h7** is possible.\n\nSo after **Qg5+**, Black can play **Kh7**, and the queen on g6 is still attacked.\n\nThen White plays **Qxg6+**, and wins the queen.\n\nSo: **Qg5+ followed by Qxg6** wins the queen **if Black doesn't prevent it**.\n\nTherefore, **Qg5+ is a deadly threat**.\n\nSo **Black must prevent Qg5+**.\n\nHow?\n\nEither:\n1. **Move the queen** from g6.\n2. **Block the diagonal** from d5 to g5.\n3. **Capture the queen on d5**.\n4. **Interpose** \u2014 but no piece can block d5\u2013g5.\n5. **Move the king** so that Qg5+ doesn\u2019t work.\n\nBut **Qg5+ is only check if the king is on h6**.\n\nSo if Black moves the king from h6, then Qg5 is not check, but still attacks the queen.\n\nBut then Black can recapture if needed.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s clarify:\n\n- If **Black plays Kh7**, then **Qg5** is not check, but attacks the queen on g6.\n- Then Black can play **Qg6\u2013g8** or something.\n\nBut White might have other ideas.\n\nBut the **immediate threat is Qg5+**, which **forks** the king and queen \u2014 because after Qg5+, if Black moves king, White takes queen; if Black takes queen, king is in check.\n\nWait \u2014 **Qg5+** is check, so Black **must respond to the check**.\n\nOnly moves: **Kh7** (only legal king move \u2014 g7 is attacked by Bg3? Let's see).\n\nFrom h6, king can go to:\n- h7\n- g7\n- g6\n\nBut:\n- **g7**: is it attacked? Bg3 controls h2\u2013b8 diagonal \u2014 does it hit g7?\n\nBg3 is on g3, so diagonal: h4, g3, f2, e1 \u2014 no, that\u2019s a8\u2013h1 diagonal? Wait.\n\ng3 is on light square. Diagonals:\n- a8\u2013h1: a8, b7, c6, d5, e4, f3, g2, h1 \u2014 g3 not on it.\n- a1\u2013h8: a1, b2, c3, d4, e5, f6, g7, h8 \u2014 yes! **Bg3 controls g7**.\n\nSo **g7 is attacked by Bg3**.\n\nSo king **cannot go to g7**.\n\ng6: is it attacked? g6 is where the queen is \u2014 but king can\u2019t go there anyway (occupied).\n\nSo only **h7** is safe.\n\nSo after **Qg5+**, Black **must play Kh7**, then White plays **Qxg6**, winning the queen.\n\nSo **White is threatening to win the queen with Qg5+ and Qxg6**.\n\nTherefore, **Black must prevent Qg5+**.\n\nHow?\n\nOnly ways:\n- **Move the queen** from g6.\n- **Interpose** on g5 \u2014 but no piece can go to g5 safely.\n- **Capture the queen on d5**.\n- **Block the diagonal** \u2014 but d5\u2013g5 is a diagonal, and no piece can block it except a piece on e6 or f5 \u2014 but f5 is occupied by White rook.\n\nSo **no blocking**.\n\nSo Black must either:\n- Move the queen\n- Or move the king so that Qg5+ is not check\n\nBut if king moves to h7, then Qg5 is not check, but still attacks queen \u2014 but then Black can move queen away.\n\nBut **Qg5+ is only possible if king is on h6**.\n\nSo if Black plays **Kh7**, then **Qg5** is not check, and Black can respond to Qg5 with Qg8 or Qf6, etc.\n\nSo **Kh7** removes the **immediate tactical threat** of Qg5+ winning the queen.\n\nAlternatively, **moving the queen** also prevents it.\n\nBut if Black moves the queen, where?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **list of legal moves**:\n\n```\nh6h7, g6h7, g6g5, g6f5, g6g4, g6g3, f6d8, f6e7, f6g5, f6e5, f6h4, f6d4, b1b3, b1b2, b1h1, b1g1, b1f1, b1e1, b1d1, b1c1, b1a1, c7c6, a7a6, c7c5, a7a5\n```\n\nSo **Kh7** is **h6h7** \u2014 available.\n\n**Qg6\u2013h7** is **g6h7** \u2014 also available.\n\n**Qg6\u2013g5** \u2014 g6g5\n\n**Q"
