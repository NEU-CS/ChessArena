When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black's b4 pawn is very advanced.\n\nKey point: **White king is on e3**, **Black king on e5** \u2014 they are adjacent vertically.\n\nWhite to move.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: List of Legal Moves**\n\nGiven legal moves:\n- `e3f3`, `e3d3`, `e3f2`, `e3e2`, `e3d2` \u2014 king moves\n- `f4e5` \u2014 pawn captures e5\n- `f4f5` \u2014 pawn push\n- `h3h4`, `g3g4` \u2014 pawn pushes\n- `a2a3`, `a2a4` \u2014 pawn moves\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each **candidate move**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 4: Candidate Move Analysis**\n\n#### **1. f4e5** \u2014 f4 captures e5\n- Captures the e5 pawn.\n- After `f4e5`, Black can recapture with `d5xe5` or `Ke5xe5`?\n  - But Ke5 cannot capture on e5 \u2014 it's occupied by its own pawn? Wait no: after f4 captures on e5, the e5 pawn is gone.\n\nWait: current position:\n- e5: black pawn\n- f4: white pawn\n\nSo `f4e5` captures the black pawn on e5.\n\nAfter `f4e5`, black can:\n- Recapture with `d5e5` (pawn) \u2014 but d5 is also a black pawn. So `d5xe5` is possible.\n- Or `Ke5xe5` \u2014 king captures.\n\nBut after `f4e5`, the e5 square is occupied by white pawn.\n\nSo Black can play:\n- `d5xe5` \u2014 recaptures with pawn\n- `Ke5xe5` \u2014 recaptures with king\n\nBut if Black plays `Ke5xe5`, then White can play `Ke3-f3` or similar, and the kings are separated.\n\nBut more importantly: what happens after `f4e5`?\n\nLet\u2019s consider:\n- After `f4e5`, if Black plays `d5xe5`, then we have:\n  - White: pawn on e5\n  - Black: pawn on e5 (from d5)\n  - Then White can play `Ke3-d4` or similar, attacking the e5 pawn.\n\nBut wait: after `f4e5`, Black plays `d5xe5`, then White has a pawn on e5, Black has a pawn on e5 \u2014 same square? No, only one piece per square.\n\nNo: `f4e5` means the f4 pawn goes to e5 and captures the black pawn there.\n\nThen Black plays `d5e5` \u2014 captures the white pawn on e5.\n\nSo after `f4e5 d5xe5`, the e5 square has a black pawn.\n\nThen White can play `Ke3-d4`, attacking the e5 pawn.\n\nBut Black can defend with `Ke5-d6` or `g6-g5` to support?\n\nBut more importantly: what about the **passed pawn**?\n\nAlternatively, if Black recaptures with king: `Ke5xe5`, then White plays `Ke3-d3` or `Kd4`, and the black king is exposed.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at **tactical consequences**.\n\nBut wait: after `f4e5`, if Black plays `Ke5xe5`, then White plays `Ke3-d3`, and now the b4 pawn is under pressure.\n\nBut Black can play `b4-b3` to push.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider **king safety and opposition**.\n\nBut perhaps a better idea: **White should aim to gain the opposition or restrict the black king**.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at **f4f5**.\n\n#### **2. f4f5** \u2014 push the f-pawn\n\n- Closes the center.\n- After `f4f5`, the pawn is on f5, blocking the kings from going through.\n- Black has g6 pawn \u2014 can it capture? `g6xf5`?\n  - Yes, but then White can recapture with g3xf5 or h3xf5? No, h3 is on h3, not h4.\n\nAfter `f4f5`, Black can play `g6xf5`, then White can recapture with `g3xf5`.\n\nThen we have:\n- Open g-file?\n- But Black has h5 pawn, White h3.\n\nBut after `f4f5 g6xf5 g3xf5`, White has a passed f-pawn on f5, but it's isolated.\n\nBut more importantly, the kings are still in the center.\n\nBut `f4f5` might **lose a tempo** or allow Black to improve.\n\nBut it **blocks the kings from entering via f4**, which might be useful.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider **king moves**.\n\n#### **3. King moves: e3f3, e3d3, e3f2, e3e2, e3d2**\n\nWhite king is on e3, Black king on e5.\n\nThe kings are in **opposition** \u2014 same file, one square apart.\n\nSo if White moves the king away, Black can take the opposition.\n\nFor example:\n- If `Ke3-f3`, then `Ke5-f5` \u2014 Black takes the opposition and advances.\n- Similarly, `Ke3-d3`, then `Ke5-d5` \u2014 same.\n\nSo **any king move loses the opposition**, allowing Black king to advance.\n\nThat\u2019s bad.\n\nSo **king moves are likely bad** unless forced.\n\nWe must avoid giving the black king access to d4, c5, f4, etc.\n\nCurrently, White king controls d4, e4, f4.\n\nIf White moves Ke3-f3, then Black plays Ke5-f5, and now Kf5 controls e6, f6, g6, e4, f4, g4"
