When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n4R3/6Q1/1k1q3p/2p2p2/8/7P/rPP2PP1/6K1 w - - 2 33\n```\n\nThis means:\n- White to move\n- White has a rook on e8 and a queen on g7\n- White king on g1\n- Black has queen on d6, king on b6, rook on a2, pawn on h6, c5, f5\n- White pawns on b2, c2, f2, g2, h3\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Evaluate the position**\n\n**Material:**\n- White: Rook, Queen, King, 5 pawns\n- Black: Queen, Rook, King, 4 pawns\nMaterial is roughly equal (both have queen + rook + king + pawns), but White has a more active position.\n\n**King safety:**\n- White king on g1 \u2014 relatively safe.\n- Black king on b6 \u2014 exposed, near the center and edge of the board. Could be vulnerable to checks.\n\n**Piece activity:**\n- White queen on g7 \u2014 very strong, pointing at the black king along the 7th rank and can access the kingside or central files.\n- White rook on e8 \u2014 currently passive, but can become active.\n- Black queen on d6 \u2014 active, defending key squares and supporting the c5 pawn.\n- Black rook on a2 \u2014 attacking two pawns (b2, c2), potentially dangerous if supported.\n\n**Threats:**\n- Black\u2019s rook on a2 is attacking b2 and c2. If White doesn\u2019t defend or distract, Black might win a pawn.\n- However, Black\u2019s king is on b6 \u2014 exposed to checks.\n\n**Immediate tactical ideas:**\n- Can White deliver a check? Yes:\n  - Queen checks: Qg7\u2013f7+, Qg7\u2013e7+, Qg7\u2013d7+, Qg7\u2013c7+, Qg7\u2013b7+, Qg7\u2013a7+\n  - Rook checks: Re8\u2013e6+ (not possible), Re8\u2013e7+, Re8\u2013e5+, etc.\n\nBut let\u2019s look for **forcing moves**, especially **checks** and **threats of mate**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Look for tactical shots**\n\nLet\u2019s consider **checks** first.\n\n#### **Queen checks:**\n- **g7-b7+**: Qb7+! This attacks the black king directly.\n  - After **Qb7+**, Black king must move:\n    - Kb6\u2013a6? Then Qa7# \u2014 mate!\n    - Kb6\u2013c6? Then Qc7# \u2014 mate!\n    - Kb6\u2013a5? Then Qa7# \u2014 mate!\n    - Kb6\u2013c5? Then Qc7# \u2014 mate!\n\nWait \u2014 is **Qb7+** actually possible?\n\nQueen is on g7. Can it go to b7?\n\nYes \u2014 **g7 to b7** is a legal diagonal move (a8\u2013h1 diagonal). So **g7b7** is a legal move.\n\nNow, let\u2019s test:\n\n**1. Qb7+!**\n\nBlack king on b6 is in check. Where can it go?\n\n- **Ka6**: Qa7# \u2014 mate\n- **Kc6**: Qc7# \u2014 mate\n- **Ka5**: Qa7# \u2014 mate\n- **Kc5**: Qc7# \u2014 mate\n\nAll king moves lead to immediate mate.\n\nSo **Qb7+** is **checkmate in 1** \u2014 no, wait: **Qb7+ is check, and after any king move, queen delivers mate next move** \u2014 but is it mate immediately?\n\nNo \u2014 **Qb7+** is not mate by itself, but it **forces mate on the next move** regardless of Black\u2019s reply.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **Qb7+** actually possible?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check the board.\n\nQueen on g7, wants to go to b7.\n\nPath: g7 \u2192 f6 \u2192 e5 \u2192 d4 \u2192 c3 \u2192 b2 \u2192 a1? No \u2014 that\u2019s the a1\u2013h8 diagonal.\n\nBut **g7 to b7** is horizontal \u2014 same rank? No, g7 and b7 are both on the 7th rank!\n\n**g7 and b7 are on the same rank (7th rank)** \u2014 so the queen can move horizontally from g7 to b7.\n\nYes! **g7b7** is a **horizontal move** along the 7th rank.\n\nSo **Qb7+** is absolutely possible.\n\nNow, after **Qb7+**, the black king is in check from the queen on b7.\n\nBlack king on b6 \u2014 adjacent to b7 \u2014 so yes, it\u2019s in check.\n\nCan the king capture the queen? No \u2014 king on b6, queen on b7 \u2014 yes, it **can** capture: **Kxb7**?\n\nWait! **This is critical.**\n\nIf White plays **Qb7+**, Black can **capture the queen** with **Kxb7**!\n\nBecause the black king is on b6, and b7 is adjacent \u2014 so **Kxb7** is legal.\n\nSo **Qb7+??** loses the queen to **Kxb7**.\n\nSo **Qb7+ is a blunder**.\n\nWe must avoid that.\n\nSo **Qb7+ is not safe**.\n\nWhat about **Qa7+**?\n\nQueen from g7 to a7 \u2014 along the 7th rank.\n\na7 is two squares left of b7 \u2014 so yes, **g7a7** is legal.\n\n**Qa7+** \u2014 check.\n\nKing on b6 \u2014 can it capture? b6 to a7 \u2014 yes, **Kxa7** \u2014 again, king captures queen.\n\nSo **Qa7+??** also loses the queen.\n\nSame for **Qc7+**: c7 is adjacent to b6 \u2014 king can capture.\n\nSo **any queen check on the 7th rank (a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7)** \u2014 but only those on c7, b7, a7 are adjacent to b6.\n\n- **Qc7+**: Kxc7 \u2014 king captures\n- **Qb7+**: Kxb7\n- **Qa7+**: Kxa7\n\nSo **all queen checks on the 7th rank that are adjacent to b6 result in the queen being captured**.\n\nWhat about **Qd7+**?\n\nd7 \u2014 is d7 adjacent to b6? b6 to d7 is two files and one rank \u2014 not adjacent. So king cannot capture.\n\nSo **Qd7+** is a possible check.\n\nTry: **g7d7**\n\nQueen to d7 \u2014 check.\n\nKing on b6 \u2014 not adjacent to d7 (distance: b6\u2013c6\u2013d6\u2013d7), so cannot capture.\n\nWhere can king go?\n\n- **Kc6**: then Qc7# \u2014 mate!\n- **Ka6**: Qc7 \u2014 not mate yet, but Qc7 attacks b7 and a7, and threatens mate on b7 or c8.\n  - But after Ka6, is there mate? Qc7 \u2014 then Black can play Kb6 again? Or Ra1+?\n  - Not forced mate.\n\nWait \u2014 after **Qd7+**, if **Kc6**, then **Qc7#** \u2014 yes, because queen on c7, king on c6 \u2014 adjacent, and no escape \u2014 b6, b7, c6, d6, d7 are all attacked or blocked.\n\n- King on c6\n- Queen on c7 \u2014 controls c7, c8, c6, b7, d7, etc.\n- So **Qc7#** is mate \u2014 yes.\n\nBut after **Qd7+**, Black can play **Ka6** instead of Kc6.\n\nSo:\n- **Qd7+ Kc6 Qc7#** \u2014 mate\n- **Qd7+ Ka6** \u2014 then White has Qd7, but no immediate mate.\n\nSo not forced mate.\n\nBut still, **Qd7+** wins the queen or leads to advantage.\n\nBut let\u2019s look for better.\n\nWhat about **Re8\u2013e6+**?\n\nRook on e8 to e6 \u2014 is that check?\n\ne6 \u2014 is it attacking b6? No \u2014 rook moves vertically/horizontally.\n\ne6 is on e-file, 6th rank.\n\nBlack king on b6 \u2014 not on e-file or 6th rank \u2014 so **Re6 is not check**.\n\nBut **Re6** attacks d6 \u2014 where the black queen is!\n\nSo **Re6** attacks the queen.\n\nBut Black can play **Qd6\u2013d5** or something.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: **Re6** threatens to capture queen.\n\nBut after **Re6**, Black plays **Qd5**, and White gains a tempo, but not decisive.\n\nBut better: what about **Re8\u2013b8+**?\n\nRook from e8 to b8 \u2014 along the 8th rank.\n\nb8 \u2014 is it check?\n\nKing on b6 \u2014 b8 is two squares above \u2014 so yes, **Rb8+** is check.\n\nCan the king capture? b6 to b8 \u2014 no, not adjacent (one square in between \u2014 b7).\n\nSo king cannot capture.\n\nWhere can"
