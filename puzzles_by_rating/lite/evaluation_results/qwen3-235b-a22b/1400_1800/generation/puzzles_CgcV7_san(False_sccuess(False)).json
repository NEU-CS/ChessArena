When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Wait \u2014 let's reconstruct the board.\n\nLet\u2019s first **reconstruct the board** from the FEN:\n\n```\n8:      8\na8 b8 c8 d8 e8 f8 g8 h8  \u2192 8th rank: empty\n7:      p  .  .  .  .  f  p  .     \u2192 a7=p, f7=p, g7=p\n6:      .  b  c  .  .  K  p  .     \u2192 b6, c6, f6=K, g6=p\n5:      .  .  .  .  .  .  P  p     \u2192 g5=P, h5=p\n4:      .  .  .  .  .  P  k  .     \u2192 f4=P, g4=k (Black king?) \u2014 wait, no\n```\n\nWait \u2014 something is wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s parse the FEN properly:\n\nFEN: `8/p4p2/1pp2Kp1/6Pp/5Pk1/P3n1P1/1P6/4B3 b - - 3 35`\n\nBreak it down rank by rank (from 8th to 1st):\n\n- **8**: `8` \u2192 8 empty squares\n- **7**: `p4p2` \u2192 pawn, 4 empty, pawn, 2 empty \u2192 a7=p, f7=p, g7=empty, h7=empty? Wait: `p4p2` = p + 4\u00d7 + p + 2\u00d7 \u2192 a7=p, f7=p, then g7/h7 empty \u2192 so a7=p, f7=p, rest empty\n- **6**: `1pp2Kp1` \u2192 1 empty, p, p, 2 empty, K, p, 1 empty \u2192 b6=p, c6=p, f6=K (White king), g6=p\n- **5**: `6Pp` \u2192 6 empty, then P, p \u2192 g5=P (White), h5=p (Black)\n- **4**: `5Pk1` \u2192 5 empty, P, k, 1 empty \u2192 f4=P (White), g4=k (Black king), h4=empty\n- **3**: `P3n1P1` \u2192 P (a3), 3 empty, n (e3), 1 empty, P (g3), 1 empty \u2192 a3=P, e3=n, g3=P\n- **2**: `1P6` \u2192 1 empty, P (b2), 6 empty \u2192 b2=P\n- **1**: `4B3` \u2192 4 empty, B (e1), 3 empty \u2192 e1=B (White bishop)\n\nSo now, let\u2019s list all pieces:\n\n**White:**\n- King: f6\n- Bishop: e1\n- Pawns: a3, b2, g3, g5, g4, f4\n\nWait \u2014 g4 and f4 are pawns? Yes \u2014 `5Pk1` on rank 4: f4=P, g4=k? No \u2014 `5Pk1` \u2192 5 empty, then P (f4), k (g4), 1 empty. But `k` is **Black king**, not a pawn.\n\nSo:\n- **Black king** is on **g4**\n- **White king** is on **f6**\n\nWait \u2014 both kings on adjacent squares? f6 and g4 \u2014 that\u2019s two squares apart diagonally (f6 to g4 is f6-g5-h4 or f6-g6-h5, not adjacent). f6 and g4 are separated by one square diagonally: f6 \u2192 g5 \u2192 h4, so not adjacent. Distance is OK.\n\nBut g4 is occupied by **Black king**, and f4 is **White pawn**.\n\nSo current position:\n\n```\n8:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -\n7:  p  -  -  -  -  p  p  -\n6:  -  p  p  -  -  K  p  -\n5:  -  -  -  -  -  -  P  p\n4:  -  -  -  -  -  P  k  -\n3:  P  -  -  -  n  -  P  -\n2:  -  P  -  -  -  -  -  -\n1:  -  -  -  -  B  -  -  -\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nNow, **Black to move**.\n\n**Material:**\n- Black: king (g4), knight (e3), pawns: a7, b6, c6, f7, g6, h5\n- White: king (f6), bishop (e1), pawns: a3, b2, f4, g3, g5\n\nBlack has an extra knight, but White has more advanced pawns and a dangerous king.\n\nNow, **legal moves given**:\n```\ng4h3, g4f3, e3f5, e3d5, e3c4, e3g2, e3c2, e3f1, e3d1, a7a6, c6c5, b6b5, h5h4, a7a5\n```\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each move carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Evaluate the position\n\n**Key features:**\n- Black king on g4 \u2014 very advanced, near White\u2019s pawns.\n- White king on f6 \u2014 also deep in Black\u2019s territory, threatening to support promotion or capture.\n- White bishop on e1 \u2014 passive, far from action.\n- Black knight on e3 \u2014 active, attacking f1, g2, d5, f5, c4, etc.\n- White pawns: g5, f4, g3, a3, b2 \u2014 g5 and f4 are advanced.\n- Black pawns: h5, g6, f7, c6, b6, a7 \u2014 potential passed pawns?\n\n**Threats:**\n- White king on f6 is threatening to go to g7 or e7 and promote the f-pawn or g-pawn.\n- Black king on g4 is threatening to capture g3 or f4.\n- If Black captures on f4, White king can recapture? But f4 is defended by g3 and e5? No \u2014 f4 is defended only by g3? Let\u2019s see:\n  - f4 pawn: defended by g3 pawn? Yes \u2014 g3 to f4 is diagonal? No \u2014 g3 to f4 is not a capture. Pawns move forward. g3 is on g3, so it defends h4 and f4? Yes \u2014 pawn on g3 defends f4 and h4.\n  - So f4 is defended by g3.\n  - g3 is defended by... no one? a3, b2, but not directly.\n\nSo if Black king takes on f4, White can recapture with g3xf4? But that\u2019s a pawn move \u2014 yes, g3 can recapture.\n\nBut after Kxf4, g3xf4, then Black king is on f4, which is strong.\n\nBut White king is on f6 \u2014 can it get to e5 or e6?\n\nAlso, Black knight on e3 \u2014 can it jump to f5? e3f5 \u2014 is f5 attacked?\n\nf5 is empty. Is it defended? g5 is on g5, so g5 pawn defends f6 and h6 \u2014 not f5. f4 pawn defends e5 and g5. So f5 is **not defended**.\n\nSo e3f5 is possible.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at **immediate threats**.\n\nWhite\u2019s last move was probably Kf6, and now Black must move.\n\nIs there a **checkmate threat**? No.\n\nBut **White is threatening to play g5-g6**, advancing the pawn.\n\ng5-g6 would be a strong move \u2014 g6, then g7, promoting.\n\nBut after g6, Black can play hxg6? h5xg6 \u2014 yes, if g6 is played.\n\nBut currently, g5 is on g5, h5 on h5 \u2014 so h5 is attacking g4? No \u2014 h5 is on h5, so it attacks g4 and g6? Yes \u2014 h5 pawn attacks g4 and g6.\n\nWait \u2014 Black pawn on h5 attacks g4? But g4 is occupied by **Black king** \u2014 so no issue.\n\nBut if White plays g5"
