        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/5pk1/2P3pp/N3b3/8/2q2PP1/P4QKP/8 w - - 1 46\n```\n\nThis means:\n- It's White's turn to move.\n- White has a knight on a5, pawn on c6, pawns on f3, g3, a2, h2, queen on f2, king on g2.\n- Black has a king on g7, pawn on g6, h6, pawns on f7, g6, h6, bishop on e5, queen on c3.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Material Count**\n- White: Queen (f2), Knight (a5), Pawns (c6, f3, g3, a2, h2)\n- Black: Queen (c3), Bishop (e5), Pawns (f7, g6, h6), King (g7)\n\nMaterial is roughly equal: both have queen + minor pieces and pawns. But **White has a dangerous passed pawn on c6**, which is one square away from queening (c7 and then c8=Q).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features of the Position**\n\n1. **White's c6-pawn is a major threat** \u2014 it can advance to c7 next move, and if not stopped, will promote soon.\n2. **Black's queen on c3 is attacking White's f3 pawn and potentially threatening back-rank ideas.**\n3. **White's king is on g2**, relatively safe, but needs care \u2014 f3 and g3 are key defensive pawns.\n4. **Black's king is on g7**, near the edge, potentially vulnerable to mating attacks if the position opens.\n5. **White's knight on a5** is somewhat out of play but can jump to c4 or b7.\n6. **White's queen on f2** is defending g3 and f3, and eyeing the kingside.\n\n---\n\n### **Candidate Moves**\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most promising options:\n\n#### **1. c6-c7** \u2014 Pushing the passed pawn\nThis is **very tempting**. After c7, the pawn threatens to promote on c8, and Black must deal with it.\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens after **c6-c7**:\n\n- Black must respond to the threat of c8=Q.\n- Black\u2019s queen on c3 can capture on f3? But after c7, if Black plays ...Qxf3+, then:\n  - gxf3 Bxf3+ (check), then Kg3 or Kh3, but then ...Bc6 is annoying, but White is up a queen for bishop+pawn? No \u2014 wait, White would have just lost the queen.\n\nWait \u2014 no: after **1. c7**, Black cannot play ...Qxf3+ because White can play **c8=Q** next move, and if Black is in check or loses the queen, it\u2019s bad.\n\nBut let\u2019s simulate:\n\n**1. c6-c7 Qc3xf3+??**\n\nNow White plays **2. c7-c8=Q!**, promoting with check: **Qc8+ Kg7**, then **3. Qc8xc3**, winning the black queen.\n\nSo if Black takes on f3, they lose their queen.\n\nAlternatively, Black can play **1... Qa1+** (checking the white king) to delay the promotion.\n\nAfter **1. c7 Qa1+ 2. Kg3** (king moves to g3), now c8=Q is still threatened.\n\nBlack can play **2... Qd4**, threatening ...Qd4-f2+ or ...Qd4-h4 mate? Let's see:\n\n- ...Qd4 doesn't stop c8=Q. So White plays **3. c8=Q**, and now we have queens on both sides.\n\nBut after **3. c8=Q Qd4**, White has a strong position: queen on c8, king on g3, and threats on the board.\n\nBut is there a better defense?\n\nAlternatively, **1. c7 Bf6**, defending c8? But then **2. c8=Q**, and White is just up a queen.\n\nWait \u2014 **Bf6 blocks the c8 square**, so if Black plays **1... Bf6**, then c8 is occupied, so **c7-c8=Q is not possible**.\n\nAh! That\u2019s critical.\n\nSo after **1. c7**, Black can play **1... Bf6!**, blocking the promotion square.\n\nThen White cannot promote immediately. Now what?\n\nWhite can play **2. Nb7** or **2. Nc4**, attacking the bishop or threatening something.\n\nBut after **1. c7 Bf6**, the pawn is stuck unless supported.\n\nBut now Black\u2019s bishop is on f6, which is somewhat awkward, but not terrible.\n\nAlternatively, White can play **2. Qb6**, pinning the bishop? But no \u2014 b6 is not attacking f6.\n\nNot really.\n\nSo **c7** allows **Bf6**, stopping immediate promotion, and the pawn is just a passed pawn, not an immediate threat.\n\nBut perhaps White can follow up with Nb7 or Nc4 to maintain pressure.\n\nStill, **c7** doesn\u2019t force anything.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider: is there a **tactical shot**?\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Nc4!** \u2014 Knight to c4\n\nWhy is this interesting?\n\n- The knight moves from a5 to c4, attacking the black queen on c3.\n- So **Nc4** attacks the queen.\n\nBlack must respond to the attack on the queen.\n\nOptions for Black:\n\n- **Qc3 moves**: ...Qd4, ...Qb4, ...Qc5, ...Qc6, ...Qa3, etc.\n- But **if Black moves the queen, then White plays c7!**, and now the pawn is advancing with tempo, and Black cannot stop both c8=Q and other threats.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n**1. Nc4! Qc3-d4** (for example)\n\nNow **2. c7!**, threatening c8=Q.\n\nBlack cannot play ...Bf6 because of **c8=Q+**, check.\n\nSo if **2... Bf6**, then **3. c8=Q+ Kg7 4. Qc8-d8+**, and the black king is in trouble.\n\nBut after **2. c7**, Black can play **2... Qd5**, defending c7?\n\nBut **3. c8=Q!**, promoting anyway: **Qc8+ Kg7 4. Qc8-c7+**, skewering the king and queen?\n\nWait: after **3. c8=Q+**, Black plays **Kg7**, then **4. Qc7+** wins the queen: **Qc7+ forces Qd7**, then **5. Qxd7+ Bxd7**, and White is up a piece.\n\nBut actually, after **3. c8=Q+ Kg7 4. Qc7+**, Black must play **Qd7**, then **5. Qxd7+ Bxd7**, and White has knight + pawn vs bishop \u2014 clearly winning.\n\nAlternatively, after **1. Nc4**, if Black plays **1... Qc5**, then **2. c7!**, same idea.\n\nOr **1... Qb4**, then **2. c7**, and again Black can\u2019t stop promotion.\n\nWhat if Black plays **1... Qc2**? Attacking the white queen?\n\nThen **2. c7!**, still \u2014 if **2... Qc1**, then **3. c8=Q**, and White is promoting.\n\nOr if **2... Bf6**, then **3. c8=Q+**, check.\n\nSo in all lines, after **1. Nc4**, Black cannot prevent **c7** followed by **c8=Q**, and the knight move gains tempo by attacking the queen.\n\nThis is **forcing**.\n\nCompare to **c7** directly: after **c7**, Black plays **Bf6**, blocking the promotion, and White has to find another plan.\n\nBut with **Nc4**, White **forces** the win of material or leads to immediate promotion.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Other moves?**\n\n- **Nb7**: attacks nothing immediately, allows ...Bf6.\n- **g4/f4**: pushing pawns on the kingside \u2014 slow, not urgent.\n- **Qe3/Qd4/etc.**: queen moves that don\u2019t address the c6 pawn or create threats.\n- **Kh3/Kg1/etc.**: king moves \u2014 passive.\n\nNone of these create immediate threats.\n\nBut **Nc4** is **active**, **gains tempo**, and **forces** the c7 push.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe best move is **Nc4**, which attacks the black queen and prepares c7 with decisive effect.\n\nAfter **Nc4**, no matter how Black moves the queen, **c7** follows, and the pawn promotes with decisive advantage.\n\nTherefore, the best move is:\n\n```\na5c4\n```"
