Kxb7**  \n   Now the king is on b7, and White has **Rd2-d7+** with devastating effect.\n\n2. **Rd7+! Ka8** (only move; Kb8?? allows Qa7#-like ideas, but here it's rook)  \n   Now, **Rxe5** wins the bishop with a clear material advantage.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after **Rd7+**, is it checkmate?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the position after:\n\n- **1. Rxb7+ Kxb7 2. Rd7+**\n\nBlack king on b7, White rook on d7 \u2014 is the king in check? Yes.\n\nCan the king go to a8? Yes.\n\nCan it go to c8? **c8 is attacked by the knight on e4?** No \u2014 Ne4 doesn't attack c8. Be3 doesn't either. So c8 is safe?\n\nWait: **c8** \u2014 is it attacked?\n\n- Be3 \u2192 controls d4, e3, f4, etc. \u2014 not c8.\n- Ne4 \u2192 controls d6, f6, c5, g5, etc. \u2014 not c8.\n- So **c8 is not attacked**.\n\nSo after:\n\n1. Rxb7+ Kxb7  \n2. Rd7+ **Kc8!** \u2014 and the king escapes.\n\nNow White can play **Rxe5**, winning the bishop.\n\nSo material gain: **Rook for bishop and pawn** \u2014 we lose a rook to take a bishop and pawn? No:\n\nWait \u2014 we **sacrificed no piece**.\n\nWe **capture on b7** with rook \u2014 so we gain a pawn.\n\nThen **Rd7+**, then **Rxe5** \u2014 we capture the bishop.\n\nSo total: **+1 pawn +1 bishop**, and we still have both rooks.\n\nWait \u2014 no: we started with two rooks.\n\n- Rb6 captures on b7 \u2192 still have that rook.\n- Then Rd2 goes to d7, then to e5.\n\nSo after **Rxb7+ Kxb7 Rd7+ Kc8 Rxe5**, we have captured **a pawn and a bishop** for **no material loss**.\n\nThat\u2019s **+2 pawns** in material (bishop \u2248 3, pawn \u2248 1).\n\nBut is there something even stronger?\n\nWait \u2014 after **Rxb7+ Kxb7 Rd7+**, is it **checkmate**?\n\nNo \u2014 as we saw, **Kc8** escapes.\n\nBut what about **Rb8#**?\n\nAfter **Rxb7+ Kxb7**, can we play **Rb8#**?\n\nRook on d2 \u2014 can it go to b8?\n\nFrom d2 to b8: same rank? No \u2014 d2 to b2 is possible, but b8 is on 8th rank.\n\nRd2 can go to d8, c2, b2, a2, d1, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7.\n\n**Rd2 cannot go to b8** \u2014 not on same file or rank.\n\nSo **Rb8** is not possible.\n\nBut **Rd8** is possible.\n\nAfter **Rxb7+ Kxb7**, can **Rd8** be useful?\n\nRd8 attacks f8, maybe cuts off escape, but not immediately decisive.\n\nBut back to **Rd7+** \u2014 after **Kc8**, we play **Rxe5**, winning the bishop.\n\nSo **Rxb7+** leads to winning a pawn and a bishop \u2014 huge.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **Rxb7+** even legal?\n\nRb6 is on b6, b7 is occupied by black pawn \u2014 yes, can capture.\n\nAnd it gives **check** \u2014 because the rook is on the 6th rank, b-file, and after capturing on b7, it\u2019s attacking along the b-file, and black king is on c7 \u2014 **is that check?**\n\nWait \u2014 **critical point**:\n\n- Rook on b6 captures pawn on b7.\n- King is on c7.\n- Is the rook on b7 giving check to king on c7?\n\nYes \u2014 same rank? No. Same file? Yes \u2014 both on the b-file? No!\n\n**b7 and c7 are adjacent files**.\n\nRook on **b7**, king on **c7** \u2014 they are on **adjacent files and same rank**.\n\nSo rook on b7 attacks along the **7th rank** and **b-file**.\n\nKing on c7 is on **c7** \u2014 so it is on the **7th rank**.\n\nSo **yes** \u2014 rook on b7 delivers **check along the 7th rank**.\n\nSo **Rxb7+** is **check** \u2014 correct.\n\nAfter **Kxb7**, king captures the rook.\n\nNow king is on b7.\n\nThen **Rd2-d7+** \u2014 rook to d7, giving check.\n\nKing on b7 \u2014 attacked by rook on d7 along the 7th rank.\n\nCan the king go to a8? Yes.\n\nCan it go to b8? Yes.\n\nCan it go to c8? Yes.\n\nBut **c8** is not attacked by anything else.\n\nSo **Kc8** is safe.\n\nBut now **Rd7** is attacking the bishop on e5 \u2014 because d7-e5 is diagonal? No \u2014 rook moves orthogonally.\n\nRd7 to e5 \u2014 same rank? e5 is on 5th rank, d7 is on 7th \u2014 no.\n\nSame file? e5 is e-file, d7 is d-file \u2014 no.\n\nSo **Rd7 does not attack e5**.\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s a problem.\n\nAfter **Rxb7+ Kxb7 Rd7+ Kc8**, the bishop on e5 is **not attacked** by Rd7.\n\nSo we cannot play **Rxe5**.\n\nWe can play **Rd2-e2**, but that doesn\u2019t help.\n\nWait \u2014 which piece attacks e5?\n\nWhite has:\n\n- Be3 \u2014 bishop on e3.\n- e3 to e5 \u2014 same file? Yes \u2014 e-file.\n- So **Be3 attacks e5** \u2014 yes! Along the e-file.\n\nSo **Be3 is already attacking the bishop on e5**.\n\nSo after **Rxb7+ Kxb7 Rd7+ Kc8**, White can play **Bxe5**, winning the bishop.\n\nAnd Black cannot recapture because the bishop is gone.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\n1. Rxb7+! Kxb7  \n2. Rd7+ Kc8  \n3. Bxe5\n\nNow White is **up a bishop and a pawn** \u2014 huge material gain.\n\nIs there any counterplay?\n\nBlack has rooks on c4 and f8, but no immediate threat.\n\nWhite can consolidate and win easily.\n\nBut is there an **even stronger** move?\n\nLet\u2019s check **Rd7+** first?\n\nTry: 1. Rd7+?\n\nBlack plays **Kb8!** (only move? Kb6? No \u2014 b6 is attacked by rook on b6? Rb6 is on b6, king on c7 \u2014 Kb6 would be into check? Rb6 attacks b6 \u2014 yes, so Kb6 is illegal.\n\nSo after **Rd7+**, Black must play **Kb8** or **Kc8**.\n\nSay **Kb8**.\n\nThen White can play **Rxb7!**, winning the pawn \u2014 same as before, but now Black can play **...Rc1+** or something?\n\nAfter:\n\n1. Rd7+ Kb8  \n2. Rxb7? But Rb6 is pinned? No \u2014 is it?\n\nRb6 is on b6 \u2014 if Rd7 is on d7, and Rb6 captures b7, then after **Rxb7**, Black can play **...Rc1+**, but White can interpose or king moves.\n\nBut after **Rd7+ Kb8 2. Rxb7**, Black has **...Rc1+ 3. Kg2 Rc2+**, etc. \u2014 messy.\n\nBut in the **Rxb7+"
