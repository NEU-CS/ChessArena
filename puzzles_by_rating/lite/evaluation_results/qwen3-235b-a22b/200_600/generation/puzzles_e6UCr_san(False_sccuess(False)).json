        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully.\n\n**FEN:** `8/k7/P7/1K3p2/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 65`\n\nWe are playing as **White** (indicated by 'w' in the FEN).\n\n### Material:\n- White: King on b5, pawn on a6\n- Black: King on a7, pawn on f5\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White has a pawn on a6, one square away from promotion.\n- Black's king is on a7, trying to prevent the pawn from queening.\n- White's king is on b5, well-placed to support the pawn.\n- Black's pawn on f5 is far away and cannot interfere.\n- The position is a theoretical **king and pawn vs king** endgame.\n\n### Goal:\nPromote the a6-pawn to a queen. The key is to avoid stalemate and make sure the black king cannot capture the pawn or block promotion.\n\n### Critical point:\nIf White plays **a6-a7**, then Black plays **Kb8**, and the pawn is stuck. So we must **force the king in front of the pawn** or **lose the opposition**.\n\nBut here, **White is to move**, and the key is to **advance the king** to allow the pawn to promote.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\n1. **b5c6** \u2013 King to c6\n   - After **Kc6**, Black is in zugzwang.\n   - If Black plays **Kb8**, then **a7** followed by promotion.\n   - If **Kb6**, then **Kd7** or **a7**, still promoting.\n   - This looks strong.\n\n2. **b5c5** \u2013 King to c5\n   - Keeps king in front of pawn, but less direct.\n   - Black can play **Kb8**, and now **a7+?** is stalemate if king is on b8 and no legal moves.\n   - Wait: after **Kc5**, if **Kb8**, then **Kb6!** wins: Kxb6 Kxa7 is not possible because White plays Kb6 first, then a7.\n   - But **Kc5** allows **Kb8**, then **Kb6!** is winning: Kb6 forces Black to allow a7.\n\n   But is **Kc5** better than **Kc6**?\n\n3. **b5a5** \u2013 King to a5\n   - Dangerous: **Ka5? Kb7!**, now if **a7**, then **Kc7**, and the pawn is blocked. White cannot make progress.\n   - Also, **Ka5** may allow **Kxa6** if the king is not protected.\n   - After **Ka5 Kb7!**, White must play **Kb5**, and it\u2019s back to the original position.\n   - Not progress.\n\n4. **b5c4** \u2013 King to c4\n   - Too far from the action. Loses time.\n   - Black can approach with king or even push f-pawn eventually.\n   - Not optimal.\n\n5. **b5b4** \u2013 King to b4\n   - Also drifting away. Not helpful.\n\n6. **b5a4** \u2013 King to a4\n   - Even worse. Allows **Kb6**, and now the a6 pawn is under pressure.\n   - After **Ka4 Kb6**, White cannot protect a6 without losing the pawn.\n   - Losing.\n\n---\n\n### Best Move: **b5c6**\n\nWhy?\n\n- **1. Kc6!** puts Black in zugzwang.\n- Black must move:\n  - **1... Kb8** \u2192 2. a7+ Ka8 \u2192 3. Kb6 f4 \u2192 4. a8=Q+ (checkmate soon)\n  - **1... Kb6** \u2192 2. a7 Kc7 \u2192 3. a8=Q, winning\n  - **1... Kc7** \u2192 2. a7, then Kb7 or a8=Q, winning\n\nAlso, **Kc6** cuts off the black king from escaping and forces it to the back rank.\n\nCompare with **Kc5**:\n- **1. Kc5 Kb8** \u2192 2. Kb6! Kxa8?? \u2192 3. Kc7, but wait: no, after **Kb6**, if **Kxa8**, then **Kc7** wins, but Black won\u2019t play that.\n- Actually, after **Kc5 Kb8**, **Kb6!** is also winning.\n\nBut **Kc6** is more direct and avoids any risk.\n\nAlso, **Kc6** prevents any chance of stalemate because the black king will be forced to b8, and after a7, it's a8, and White promotes with check.\n\nWait: **a7** does **not** give check. So after:\n\n- 1. Kc6 Kb8\n- 2. a7+? \u2192 **Kxa7** \u2192 3. Kc7, then White wins the pawn but no promotion.\n\nWait! That\u2019s a **blunder**.\n\nIf White plays **a7+**, Black **captures** with **Kxa7**, and then White plays **Kc7**, but Black has no pawns, so it's a draw? No:\n\nAfter:\n- 1. Kc6 Kb8\n- 2. a7+ Kxa7\n- 3. Kc7\n\nNow White has king on c7, Black king on a7. White cannot make progress \u2014 this is a **draw**.\n\nOh no! So we **must not** play a7 when the black king can capture.\n\nSo the key is to **force the black king away from the a8 square** before pushing the pawn.\n\nTherefore, the correct plan is:\n\n- **1. Kc5!** (not Kc6)\n\nLet\u2019s reevaluate.\n\n### Correct Plan:\n\nThe **key idea** is to **lose a tempo** with the king to force Black into zugzwang.\n\nThis is a classic **triangulation** idea.\n\nBut here, the winning move is **Kb5 to c5**, not c6.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n**1. Kc5!**\n\nNow:\n- If **Kb8**, then **Kb6!** (now Black is in zugzwang)\n  - If **Kc8**, then **a7**, and promotes.\n  - If **Kb8**, then **a7**, and **Ka8**, then **Kc7**, and promotes.\n  - After **Kb6**, Black has no good moves.\n\nWait: after **1. Kc5 Kb8**, then **2. Kb6!**\n\nNow Black must move:\n- **Kb8** \u2192 3. a7+ Ka8 \u2192 4. Kc7 f4 \u2192 5. a8=Q+ Kb7 \u2192 6. Qa7+ etc., checkmate.\n\nBut **a7+** after **Kb6 Kb8** is **a7+ Ka8**, then **Kc7**, and promote.\n\nBut what if after **1. Kc5**, Black plays **Kb7**?\n\nThen **2. Kb5!**, back to the original position, but now it's Black to move \u2014 that\u2019s the **zugzwang**.\n\nWait, no: after **1. Kc5 Kb7**, White plays **2. Kb5**, and it's the same as start, but now it's Black to move \u2014 but in the original, it was White to move.\n\nNo: in the original, White just moved to b5, now after **Kc5 Kb7 Kb5**, it's Black to move.\n\nBut in the starting position, it was White to move.\n\nSo **Kc5** allows **Kb7**, then **Kb5**, and now Black must move away from b7, allowing a7.\n\nYes!\n\nSo:\n- 1. Kc5 Kb7\n- 2. Kb5 \u2014 now Black must move:\n  - **Kb8** \u2192 3. Kc6! (now if Kb7, a7) or 3. a7\n  - **Kc7** \u2192 3. a7, then Kb7 or Kd7, but Kc6 wins\n  - **Kc8** \u2192 3. a7\n\nAll lead to promotion.\n\nBut what if after **1. Kc5**, Black plays **Kc7**?\n\nThen **2. Kb5!**, again threatening a7.\n\n- If **Kb7**, then **Kc5** again, triangulating.\n\nBut simpler: after **1. Kc5 Kc7**, **2. a7!**?\n\nNo: **2. a7? Kd7!**, then **Kb6 Kc8**, and White cannot make progress \u2014 Black draws.\n\nSo **a7** too early is bad.\n\nSo after **1. Kc5 Kc7**, White should play **2. Kb5!**, same as before.\n\nThen:\n- If **Kb7**, then **Kc5**, and now Black is in zugzwang.\n\nEventually, White will play **Kc6** or **a7** at the right moment.\n\nBut the key is that **Kc5** allows White to **lose a tempo** and force Black to move.\n\nNow compare with **Kc6**:\n\n**1. Kc6? Kb8!**\n\nNow:\n- 2. a7+"
