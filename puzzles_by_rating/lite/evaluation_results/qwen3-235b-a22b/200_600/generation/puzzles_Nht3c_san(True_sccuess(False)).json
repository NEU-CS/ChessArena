However, White has active pieces.\n\n### Positional Assessment:\n- White has both rooks on the 7th rank (Rb7 and Re4), putting pressure on Black\u2019s position.\n- Black\u2019s king is on g8, relatively safe for now, but there may be mating motifs.\n- The black bishop on e5 is somewhat exposed.\n- White\u2019s rook on b7 is attacking the 7th rank, and the rook on e4 is centrally placed, eyeing the e5-bishop.\n- Black\u2019s rook on d8 is passive.\n- White has a potential mating net idea: if we can remove the e5-bishop and bring the rook to f7 or b8, there might be a mating attack.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nLet\u2019s evaluate key candidates:\n\n#### 1. **Rxe5** \u2013 winning the bishop.\n- 22. Rxe5 Rxe5 (forced)\n- Now 23. Rb8+ Rf8 24. Rxf8+ Kxf8\n- This leads to a rook endgame where White has a passed pawn on a2 and c2, but it's not clearly winning.\n- Alternatively, 23. Rb8+ Re8 24. Rxe8+ Kxe8 \u2013 again, king and pawn endgame, likely drawn.\n- So, trading rooks leads to simplification and likely a draw. But we want to **press for a win**.\n\n#### 2. **Rb8+** \u2013 checking the king, threatening mate.\n- 22. Rb8+ Rf8\n- 23. Rxf8+ Kxf8\n- Now White has Rxe5, but again, simplifies to rook endgame.\n- However, after 22. Rb8+ Rf8 23. Re8+!?? \u2013 but that\u2019s not possible because Re4 is on e4, not e3.\n\nWait: Re4 is on e4. So after 22. Rb8+ Rf8, we can play 23. Re8+! Kf7 24. Rb7+ Ke6 25. Rxe8 \u2013 but that\u2019s a trade.\n\nBut let's see: 22. Rb8+ Rf8 23. Re8+ Kf7 24. Rxf8 Kxf8 \u2013 again, same thing.\n\nSo **Rb8+** forces trades.\n\nBut what if we **avoid trades** and **increase pressure**?\n\n#### 3. **Rxf7!** \u2013 sacrificing the rook.\nLet\u2019s calculate:\n- 22. Rxf7! Kxf7\n- 23. Rb7+ Ke8\n- 24. Rb8+ Kd7\n- 25. Rb7+ Kc6\n- 26. Rb3! (or Rb4) \u2013 now White has a dangerous passed c-pawn and active rook.\n\nBut Black can play 22... Kxf7 23. Rb7+ Ke8 24. Rb8+ Kd7 25. Rb7+ Kc6 \u2014 perpetual check?\n\nWait: after 25... Kc6, White can play **26. c3!**, preventing ...Kb6, and supporting the idea of c4, then Kb1, etc.\n\nBut is there a better way?\n\nWait \u2014 what if after 22. Rxf7! Kxf7 23. Rb7+ Ke8 24. Rb8+ Kd7 25. Rb7+ Kc6 26. Rb3! a4 27. Rb4 Kb6 28. c4! \u2014 now White gains space and can advance.\n\nBut still, it's not clearly winning.\n\nBut let's go back.\n\n#### 4. **Re7!** \u2013 attacking the bishop and threatening mate on f7.\n\n- 22. Re7! Rb8 (only move to defend f7)\n- Now 23. Rb7! \u2014 now the rook on b7 attacks the rook on b8.\n- If 23... Rxb7 24. Rxe5 \u2014 winning the bishop and threatening mate on f7.\n- After 24... Rb8 25. Rf5! \u2014 threatening Rf7, and Black is helpless.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n- 22. Re7! Rb8\n- 23. Rb7! Rxb7\n- 24. Rxe5 Rb8\n- 25. Rf5! g6 (only) 26. Rf7! \u2014 now Rf7 wins the rook or forces mate.\n\nBecause:\n- 26... Kg8 27. Rh7! \u2014 mating net: Rh7, Rb7, etc.\n- Or 26... Rb7 27. Rb5! \u2014 cutting off the king.\n\nBut even better: after 24. Rxe5, Black cannot stop Rf5-f7.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after 22. Re7, what if Black plays 22... Bf6 instead of Rb8?\n\n- 22... Bf6? 23. Rxf6! gxf6 24. Rb7! \u2014 now Rb7 attacks f7, and there\u2019s no defense: 24... Kg8 25. Rb8+ Rf8 26. Rxf8+ Kxf8 27. Rb8+ \u2014 skewer! Wins the rook.\n\nSo 22... Bf6 loses immediately.\n\nWhat if 22... Rf6? 23. Rb7! \u2014 threatening Rb8+ and Rxf7.\n\nBut 22... Rf6 23. Rb7 Rf8 24. Re8+! Rf8 25. Rb8 \u2014 mate coming.\n\nNo, 24. Re8+ Rxe8 25. Rb8+ \u2014 skewer again.\n\nSo Black must play 22... Rb8.\n\nBut then 23. Rb7! Rxb7 24. Rxe5 \u2014 now White is up a piece and has a winning position.\n\nAfter 24... Rb8 25. Rf5! \u2014 threatening Rf7.\n\nBlack has no good defense:\n- 25... g6 26. Rf7! \u2014 now if 26... Kg8 27. Rh7! Kf8 28. Rf7+ Ke8 29. Rb7 \u2014 wins the rook.\n- Or 26... Rb7 27. Rb5! \u2014 cuts off escape.\n\nSo **Re7** is crushing.\n\nCompare to **Rb8+** or **Rxe5**, which lead to simplifications.\n\n**Re7** maintains tension, increases pressure, and wins material or forces mate.\n\n### Is there a better move?\n\nWhat about **Rd7**? Similar idea: 22. Rd7 Rb8 23. Rb7! \u2014 same as above, but Re4 is less active.\n\nBut Re7 is more direct.\n\n**Rc7**? Less active.\n\n**Rb6**? Not threatening enough.\n\nSo **Re7** is the best.\n\n### Final Decision:\n\n**22. Re7!** \u2014 threatens both the bishop and mate on f7, forcing Black into a losing position.\n\n```\nRe7\n```"
