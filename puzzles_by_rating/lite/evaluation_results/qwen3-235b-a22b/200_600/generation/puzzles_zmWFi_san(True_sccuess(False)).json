No \u2014 both sides have two rooks. But Black has more pawns, though they are mostly immobile.\n- White\u2019s king is on b1, somewhat passive.\n- Black\u2019s king is on a4 \u2014 very exposed, on the edge.\n- Black has a dangerous passed pawn on a6, but it's blocked and not immediately threatening.\n- The rook on b3 is **attacking** the c3 rook and is **undefended**.\n- The rook on b8 is passive.\n- White\u2019s rooks are both on the 3rd rank, controlling the 3rd rank.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Tactical Feature**\n\nBlack\u2019s rook on **b3** is **undefended** and **attacking** White\u2019s rook on c3.\n\nWhite can play **Rxb3**, capturing the rook.\n\nLet\u2019s examine the consequences:\n\n#### **After Rxb3:**\n- Material: White captures a rook, so now White is **up a rook**.\n- Black\u2019s king on a4 will have no immediate counter.\n- Black\u2019s other rook is on b8, which can now come to b1+ or b2, but:\n  - After Rxb3, White\u2019s king can move to c2, c1, or a2 depending on the reply.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n1. **Rxb3** Kxb3  \n   - Now Black\u2019s king captures back.\n   - But then White has **Re3-e1** or **Re3-e8+**, but more importantly, White\u2019s other rook on e3 is still active.\n   - However, after Kxb3, Black\u2019s king is on b3, very deep in White\u2019s position.\n   - Then White can play **Kc1** or **Kc2**, centralizing.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **Rxb3** safe?\n\nLet\u2019s check:  \n- If White plays **Rxb3**, Black can **Kxb3** \u2014 yes, the king captures.\n- Then White can **Re3-e1**, but Black might play **Rb8-b4+**, attacking the king.\n\nBut White\u2019s king can go to **c1** or **c2**.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider: is there a **tactical refutation** to **Rxb3**?\n\nAfter:\n\n1. Rxb3 Kxb3  \n2. Re3-e1? Rb8-b4+!  \n3. Kc1? Rb4-c4+! and Black wins the other rook?\n\nWait \u2014 **Rb4-c4+** attacks the rook on c3? No \u2014 **c3 rook is already gone** \u2014 it was captured.\n\nAfter Rxb3, the rook on c3 is gone. Only rook left is on e3.\n\nSo after:\n\n1. Rxb3 Kxb3  \n2. Re3-e1 Rb8-b4+  \n3. Kc1 Rc4+? No \u2014 Rc4+ is not possible unless rook is on c8.\n\nWait \u2014 Black\u2019s rook is on b8. After Kxb3, Black plays **Rb8-b4+**, checking the king.\n\nWhite king must move:\n\n- Kc1 or Ka2 or Ka1.\n\nSay:\n\n3. Kc1 Rb4-c4+? But **Rc4+** is not possible \u2014 the rook is on b4, and c4 is not a check unless king is on d1 or d2.\n\nWait \u2014 after **Rb4**, it\u2019s a check only if the rook attacks b1 or c1.\n\nRb4 attacks b1, b2, etc. So **Rb4+** is a check only if it attacks the king.\n\nAfter 1. Rxb3 Kxb3  \n2. Re3-e1 Rb8-b4+  \n3. Kc1\n\nNow Rb4 attacks b1, but king is on c1 \u2014 **Rb4 does not give check to c1** \u2014 it\u2019s on the b-file, king is on c1 \u2014 not aligned.\n\nSo **Rb4 is not a check**.\n\nSo after:\n\n1. Rxb3 Kxb3  \n2. Re3-e1\n\nBlack has no check. Black\u2019s rook on b8 is passive. King on b3 is stuck.\n\nWhite can follow up with **Kc1**, then **Re1-e8**, **g3**, etc.\n\nWhite is clearly winning \u2014 up a rook.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **Rxb3** the only winning move?\n\nLet\u2019s consider alternatives:\n\n### **Other Legal Moves:**\n- **Kc2**, **Ka2**, **Kc1**, **Ka1**\n\nThese are all king moves. Why would we want to move the king?\n\nPossibly to support the rooks or avoid skewers, but:\n\n- Black\u2019s rook on b3 is **hanging** \u2014 why not take it?\n\nIs there a **tactical reason not to play Rxb3**?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check:\n\n- If White plays **Kc2**, then Black can play **Rb3xc3+!**, winning the rook!\n  - Because then Kxc3, and now Black\u2019s rook on b8 is still there, but White has lost a rook.\n\nSo **Kc2?? Rb3xc3+!** loses a rook.\n\nSimilarly, **Ka2?? Rb3xc3!** \u2014 same thing \u2014 rook is unprotected.\n\n**Kc1?? Rb3xc3+!** again \u2014 Black takes the rook.\n\n**Ka1?? Rb3xc3+!** \u2014 same.\n\nSo **all king moves lose the rook on c3 immediately** to **Rb3xc3+**.\n\nTherefore, **only safe moves are Rxb3 or possibly Re3-e1?** \u2014 but **Re3-e1** is not in the legal moves list.\n\nWait \u2014 the legal moves are: **Kc2, Ka2, Kc1, Ka1, Rxb3**\n\nSo **Rxb3** is the **only move that doesn't lose material immediately**.\n\nAll king moves allow **Rb3xc3+**, winning a rook for Black.\n\nTherefore, **Rxb3** is forced \u2014 and it\u2019s winning.\n\nBy capturing the rook, White wins a piece and reaches a winning endgame.\n\nAfter **Rxb3 Kxb3**, White is up a rook, and can activate the other rook and king.\n\nNo counterplay for Black.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n**Rxb3** is the only move that:\n- Doesn\u2019t lose material immediately\n- Wins a rook\n- Leads to a winning endgame\n\nAll other moves (king moves) lose the rook on c3 to **Rb3xc3+**.\n\nTherefore, the best and only good move is:\n\n```\nRxb3\n```"

Rxb3 (Black captured on b3)  \n- Rxb3+ (White recaptured with the rook, giving check)\n\nSo the sequence was:\n- Black played ...Rxb3+, White responded Rxb3+ (which must have been a recapture, implying White's rook on e3 captured the black rook on b3, giving check).\n\nBut wait \u2014 Rxb3+ from e3 to b3 is a valid rook move, and it gives check because the black king is on a4.\n\nNow, after **Rxb3+**, Black must have moved their king, but in the current FEN, the black king is still on a4. That suggests that either the FEN or the move history might be slightly inconsistent \u2014 unless Black *cannot* get out of check.\n\nWait: after **Rxb3+**, the black king is in check from the white rook on b3. The black king is on a4.\n\nCan the king move?\n- a4 to a5: blocked by nothing, but is it attacked? Rook on b3 controls the 3rd rank and b-file. a5 is not on same rank/file as b3 unless aligned.\n- b4: attacked by rook on b3? Yes \u2014 rook controls b-file. So b4 is under attack.\n- a3: rook on b3 attacks b3, so a3 is adjacent to b3 \u2014 but rook doesn't attack diagonally. King can go to a3 only if not attacked.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify:\n\nAfter **Rxb3+**, the white rook is on b3, checking the black king on a4 along the 3rd rank? No \u2014 **a4 and b3 are not on the same rank or file**.\n\n- a4 is file a, rank 4\n- b3 is file b, rank 3\n\nSo they are not aligned. Therefore, **Rxb3+ cannot be a check**.\n\nBut the move is written as **Rxb3+**, implying a check.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the rook was on e3, captures on b3, and that delivers check. But how?\n\nOnly if the black king is on b3's rank or file.\n\nBut king is on a4. After rook moves from e3 to b3, it\u2019s on the same rank as a4? No \u2014 b3 is rank 3, a4 is rank 4.\n\nSame file? a4 is file a, b3 is file b \u2014 adjacent, but not same.\n\nSo **Rxb3 cannot give check to a king on a4**.\n\nTherefore, the move **Rxb3+** is impossible if the black king is on a4.\n\nBut the FEN says the black king is on a4.\n\nSo either:\n- The FEN is wrong,\n- Or the move history is wrong,\n- Or the '+' is incorrect.\n\nBut we are told:\n- FEN: `8/5p2/p6p/6p1/k7/1r2R3/6PP/1K6 w - - 0 34`\n- So black king on a4, black rook on b3, white rook on e3, white king on b1.\n\nThen \"Legal moves in SAN notation: Kc2, Ka2, Kc1, Ka1, Rxb3\"\n\nSo Rxb3 is a legal move \u2014 meaning the rook on e3 can capture the rook on b3.\n\nBut after Rxb3, does it give check? No \u2014 king on a4 is not in check from b3.\n\nSo the '+' in \"Rxb3+\" must be a mistake.\n\nBut the move history says: Rxb3, Rxb3+\n\nWait \u2014 order: \"Rxb3, Rxb3+\"\n\nThat would mean:\n- White played Rxb3\n- Then Black played Rxb3+\n\nBut that can't be \u2014 Black already has a rook on b3.\n\nUnless it's:\n- Black played ...Rxb3 (capturing something?)\n- Then White played Rxb3+ (recapturing)\n\nBut what was on b3?\n\nIn the FEN, before any move, white has rook on e3, no piece on b3. Black has rook on b3.\n\nSo if it's Black's move, ...Rxb3 doesn't make sense \u2014 the rook is already on b3.\n\nUnless it's a capture \u2014 but what is on b3?\n\nThe FEN shows: `1r2R3` on rank 3 \u2014 so from left: file a: empty, b: rook, c: empty, d: empty, e: rook, f: empty, g: empty, h: empty.\n\nSo on b3: black rook.\n\nSo Black cannot play ...Rxb3 \u2014 the rook is already on b3.\n\nTherefore, the move history must be:\n\n- White played Rxb3 (capturing the black rook on b3)\n- Then Black played Rxb3+ ??? But black just lost the rook.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the move history is the last two moves:\n- 33... Rxb3 (Black captured a white piece on b3?)\n- 34. Rxb3+ (White recaptured with check)\n\nBut in the current FEN, white rook is on e3, not b3.\n\nFEN: `1r2R3` on rank 3 \u2014 so black rook on b3, white rook on e3.\n\nSo neither rook has moved.\n\nBut the legal moves include **Rxb3** \u2014 so the white rook on e3 can capture the black rook on b3.\n\nAnd the move history says \"Rxb3, Rxb3+\" \u2014 perhaps this is not the move history, but rather **candidate moves or something else**?\n\nWait, the user says:\n> Partial move history in SAN notation: Rxb3, Rxb3+\n\nBut that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's:\n- A white piece was on b3.\n- Black played ...Rxb3, capturing it.\n- Then White played Rxb3+, recapturing.\n\nBut in the current FEN, white rook is on e3, so it must have moved from b3 to e3? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nUnless the FEN is *after* those moves.\n\nLet\u2019s re-read:\n\n> Current board position in FEN notation:  \n> `8/5p2/p6p/6p1/k7/1r2R3/6PP/1K6 w - - 0 34`\n\nSo this is the position *before* White's 34th move.\n\nSo the last move was Black's 33rd move: ...Rxb3?\n\nBut in the FEN, there is a black rook on b3 \u2014 so if Black just played ...Rxb3, that means they captured a piece on b3.\n\nWhat could be on b3?\n\nIn the FEN, on b3 is the black rook \u2014 so it's occupied.\n\nBut before the capture, there must have been a white piece on b3.\n\nBut in the current FEN, white rook is on e3 \u2014 so perhaps the white rook was on b3 and was captured?\n\nBut then how is it on e3?\n\nUnless the white rook never moved.\n\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nWait \u2014 unless \"Rxb3\" in the move history is Black's move, capturing a white rook on b3.\n\nBut in the current FEN, the white rook is on e3 \u2014 so it can't have been captured on b3.\n\nUnless the white rook on e3 is a different rook.\n\nBut White only has one rook.\n\nSo if the white rook was on b3 and was captured, then it can't be on e3.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that the **move history is misstated**, or the **FEN is after the moves**, and the move history is the previous two moves.\n\nLet\u2019s assume:\n\n- Before Black's 33rd move: white rook was on b3, black rook on b2 or something.\n- Black played ...Rxb3, capturing the white rook.\n- Then White played Rxb3+, but with what? The other rook? But White only has one rook.\n\nNo \u2014 in the FEN, White has only one rook, on e3.\n\nSo if it was captured on b3, it can't be on e3.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that the **move history is not the actual game history**, or it's labeled incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"Rxb3, Rxb3+\" are not the move history, but rather **possible moves**?\n\nBut the user says: \"Partial move history in SAN notation: Rxb3, Rxb3+\"\n\nBut that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps it's:\n- White played Rxb3 (capturing black rook on b3)\n- Then Black played Rxb3+ (with a different rook?) \u2014 but Black only has one rook"

Because the rook on e3 is on the same rank (rank 3) as the black rook on b3? No \u2014 e3 is file e, rank 3; b3 is file b, rank 3 \u2014 yes, same rank (rank 3).\n\nSo rook on e3 can move along rank 3 to capture on b3.\n\nSo Rxb3 is a legal move.\n\nNow, after Rxb3, does it give check? The black king is on a4.\n\nAfter Rxb3, the white rook is on b3.\n\nIs the black king on a4 under attack? The rook on b3 attacks along the b-file and the 3rd rank.\n\na4 is file a, rank 4 \u2014 not on b-file or rank 3. So no, not in check.\n\nSo Rxb3 is not a check.\n\nBut the move history says: \"Rxb3, Rxb3+\"\n\nPossibly, this is the last two moves:\n- Black played ...Rxb3 (but what was on b3?)\n- Then White played Rxb3+?\n\nBut in the current position, there is a black rook on b3 \u2014 so if Black just played ...Rxb3, they must have captured a white piece on b3.\n\nBut in the current FEN, the white rook is on e3 \u2014 so it wasn't captured.\n\nUnless the white rook was on b3 and moved to e3 earlier? But then it wouldn't be captured.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the move history is misordered or mislabeled.\n\nBut we are told the **current position** is as given, and it's **White to move**, and the legal moves are: `Kc2, Ka2, Kc1, Ka1, Rxb3`\n\nSo we must choose one of these.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the position.\n\n**Material:** Even \u2014 rook vs rook.\n\n**King position:** White king on b1, somewhat passive. Black king on a4 \u2014 very advanced, close to the edge, but dangerous.\n\n**Black rook on b3** \u2014 it's attacking the b2 square, and potentially threatening the white king if supported.\n\nBut currently, no immediate threat.\n\nIf White plays **Rxb3**, then **Kxb3**, and the black king captures the rook, leaving:\n\n- White: king on b1, pawns g2, h2\n- Black: king on b3, pawns a6, f7, g5, h6\n\nThen White has no rook, Black has king on b3 \u2014 very strong, threatening to advance.\n\nSo **Rxb3?? Kxb3** loses the rook for no gain, and Black's king invades.\n\nSo **Rxb3 is a blunder**.\n\nWhite should not play Rxb3.\n\nNow, king moves: Kc2, Ka2, Kc1, Ka1.\n\nWe need to keep the king safe and prevent ...Kb3 or ...Kb4.\n\nBlack's idea might be ...Kb4, then ...Kc3, invading.\n\nOr ...Rb1+ to harass the king.\n\nSo White should centralize or support the center.\n\nKc2 is the most active \u2014 it prevents ...Kb3 (after Kc2, if ...Kb4, then Kd3 or something).\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- If White plays **Kc2**, then:\n  - Black cannot play ...Kb4 because Kc2 covers b3, but not b4.\n  - ...Kb4 is possible, then White can play Kd3, attacking the rook.\n\nBut rook on b3 is defended by king? No \u2014 king on a4, rook on b3 \u2014 not defended.\n\nSo if White plays Kc2, and Black plays ...Kb4, then White can play **Kd3!**, threatening to capture the rook on b3.\n\nBlack must move the rook or king.\n\nIf ...Rd3+, then Kc2, or if ...Rb1, then Kd4, etc.\n\nBut more importantly, White can gain activity.\n\nAlternatively, **Ka2** keeps the king on the edge, less active.\n\n**Kc1** and **Ka1** are even more passive.\n\nSo **Kc2** is the best king move \u2014 centralizing and preparing to challenge the black rook.\n\nAlso, it avoids the potential ...Rb1+ followed by ...Kb3.\n\nFor example:\n- If White plays Kc1, Black plays ...Rb1+!, Kd2 (forced), then ...Kb3, and the king invades.\n- Similarly, Ka1: ...Rb1+! wins the rook.\n\nAh! Critical point:\n\nIf White plays **Ka1**, Black plays **Rb1+!**, then:\n- Kc2? But king is on a1 \u2014 after Rb1+, White must play Kc2? No \u2014 from a1, after Rb1+, the king has no legal move \u2014 b1 is attacked, a1 is attacked by rook, but king is on a1, rook checks on b1 \u2014 same rank.\n\nRook on b1 checks king on a1 \u2014 yes, along the first rank.\n\nSo ...Rb1+ when king is on a1: king has no escape \u2014 b1 is attacked, a2 is not attacked yet.\n\na2 is not attacked \u2014 so king can go to a2.\n\nSo:\n- White plays Ka1\n- Black plays ...Rb1+\n- White plays Ka2 (only move, since Kb2 is not available \u2014 b2 is not listed as legal, and in FEN, b2 is empty, but is it attacked?)\n\nWait \u2014 is b2 attacked?\n\nBlack has no pieces attacking b2 \u2014 rook on b3 attacks b2? Yes \u2014 rook on b3 controls the b-file, so b2 is attacked.\n\nSo after ...Rb1+, if king is on a1, it cannot go to b1 (occupied and attacked), b2 is attacked, a2 is not attacked.\n\na2: file a, rank 2 \u2014 not on b-file or rank 3, so not attacked by rook on b3.\n\nSo king can go to a2.\n\nSo ...Rb1+ Kc2? No \u2014 from a1, king can go to a2 only.\n\nSo ...Rb1+ Ka2.\n\nThen Black can play ...Kb4, and the king advances.\n\nBut White can play Kc2 next.\n\nBut the point is, ...Rb1+ is annoying but not immediately winning.\n\nHowever, if White plays **Kc1**, then ...Rb1+! is very strong:\n- Kc1, ...Rb1+!\n- Kd2 (only, since c2 is attacked by rook? Rook on b3 attacks c3, c2? No \u2014 b3 to c2 is not same rank/file. c2 is file c, rank 2 \u2014 not on b-file or rank 3. So c2 is not attacked.\n- So after ...Rb1+, Kc1 can go to c2.\n\nWait: king on c1, checked by rook on b1 \u2014 along the first rank? b1 and c1 are adjacent, but rook on b1 attacks along rank 1 and b-file.\n\nSo if rook is on b1, it attacks c1 along rank 1.\n\nYes \u2014 same rank.\n\nSo ...Rb1+ attacks c1.\n\nKing on c1 must move to c2 (only, since b1 and b2 are attacked, c2 is safe?).\n\nc2: is it attacked? Rook on b3 attacks b2, b1, b4, etc., but not c2 \u2014 unless same rank or file.\n\nc2 is file c, rank 2 \u2014 not on b-file or rank 3. So c2 is safe.\n\nSo ...Rb1+ Kc2.\n\nThen same as if White had played Kc2 directly.\n\nSo no harm.\n\nBut if White plays **Kc2** immediately, it avoids the check.\n\nSimilarly, Ka2 avoids it.\n\nThe key is to prevent ...Kb3.\n\nIf White king is on c2, then ...Kb4 is possible, but then Kd3! attacks the rook on b3.\n\nBlack must move the rook, and White gains the initiative.\n\nFor example:\n- 1. Kc2 Kb4\n- 2. Kd3 Rc3 (only to protect)\n- 3. Ke4! and White starts advancing.\n\nOr if ...Rd3, then Kc2 again.\n\nBut better for White.\n\nIf White plays passively, Black may draw or win.\n\nBut here, White should play actively.\n\n**Best move:"
