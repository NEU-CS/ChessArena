If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

The **Queen on b5** is also well-placed, eyeing the 7th rank and supporting potential threats.\n\nBlack\u2019s king is on h8, and the rook is on h8 \u2014 **potential back-rank issues**.\n\nBut most importantly: **White can deliver check right now with Bg7+**.\n\nLet\u2019s examine that.\n\n---\n\n### **Candidate Move: Bg7+**\n\n**1. Bg7+**\n\n- **Bg7+** checks the black king.\n- Black must respond:\n  - **Kxg7** \u2014 only legal king move.\n    - Then **Qe8!** \u2014 immediate threat of Qh8#.\n    - Black cannot stop mate:\n      - If **Rc8**, then **Qh8+ Kf6 Qh6#** or similar.\n      - If **Rf8**, **Qh8+ Kf6 Qh6#**.\n      - If **Ng8**, **Qh8+ Kf6 Qh6#**.\n      - If **Ng5**, **Qh8+ Kf6 Qh6#**.\n    - But wait \u2014 after **Kxg7**, **Qe8** threatens **Qh8#**.\n      - Can Black play **Rc8**? Yes.\n        - Then **Qh8+ Kf6 Qh6#** \u2014 but is that forced?\n        - After **Qe8 Rc8**, **Qh8+** \u2014 now:\n          - **Kg6**? No \u2014 king on g7.\n          - After **Kxg7**, king is on g7.\n          - So **Qh8+** comes with check.\n          - **Kg6**? Not possible \u2014 king is on g7.\n          - **Kg7**, then **Qh8+** forces **Kf6** or **Kg6**?\n            - **Qh8+ Kf6** \u2014 then **Qh6#** \u2014 yes, because the knight on f6 is pinned by the queen? No \u2014 queen is on h8, f6 is attacked by queen? Yes \u2014 Qh6 is check, and protected by bishop on h6? Wait \u2014 bishop is on g7, captured.\n\nWait \u2014 after **Bg7+ Kxg7**, bishop is gone.\n\nSo after **Bg7+ Kxg7**, bishop is captured.\n\nThen **Qe8** \u2014 queen to e8.\n\nNow **Qe8** threatens **Qh8#**.\n\nBlack must prevent Qh8.\n\nOptions:\n- **Rc8** \u2014 blocks the 8th rank.\n  - Then **Qh8+** \u2014 check.\n  - Black king on g7 must go to **Kf6** or **Kg6**?\n    - **Kf6** \u2014 then **Qh6+** is check, and **Qh6+ Ke5 Qe7+** \u2014 not immediate mate?\n    - Wait: **Qh8+ Kf6 Qh6+** \u2014 now:\n      - If **Ke5**, then **Qe7+ Kd5 Qd7+ Ke5 Qe7+** \u2014 draw? No, but not forced mate.\n      - But **Qh6+ Ke5 Qe7+ Kd5 Qd7+ Ke5** \u2014 perpetual?\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a better move?\n\nAfter **Bg7+ Kxg7 Qe8**, instead of **Rc8**, Black can play **Ng8** to block Qh8?\n\n- **Ng8** \u2014 blocks the h-file.\n  - Then **Qh8+ Kf6** \u2014 again, same issue.\n\nBut actually, **after Bg7+ Kxg7, Qe8** is **not** mate in a few \u2014 Black can survive with accurate defense.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a **better** move than **Bg7+**?\n\nLet\u2019s consider **immediate mate threats**.\n\n---\n\n### **Is there a faster mate?**\n\nLook at the position:\n\n- White has **Qb5**, **Bh6**, **Nf5**.\n- Black king on h8, rook on h8, so **back rank is vulnerable**.\n- **Qb5** attacks b7, but b7 is defended by rook.\n- **Bh6** is attacking g7 and potentially f8.\n\nBut **Bh6** can go to **g7**, giving check.\n\nWe already considered **Bg7+ Kxg7 Qe8**, but mate is not forced.\n\nWait \u2014 what if after **Bg7+ Kxg7**, we play **Nh6+**?\n\nNo \u2014 knight on f5, Nh6+ would be Nf5-h6+, but after Kxg7, Nh6+ is **check**, but king can take: **Kxh6**, then no mate.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, **after Bg7+ Kxg7, Qb8+!**?\n\n- **Qb8+ Rc8** \u2014 blocks.\n- Then **Qb7** \u2014 attacking rook and threatening mate?\n  - But Black plays **Rc7**, and queen retreats.\n\nNo forced mate.\n\nSo **Bg7+** may not be the best.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **Ng7**?\n\n**Ng7** \u2014 knight to g7.\n\n- Attacks the rook on h8.\n- Also, if black takes **Rxg7**, then **Qxh6+ Kg8 Qh7#** \u2014 mate!\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n**1. Ng7!**\n\n- Threat: **Nxh8**, but more importantly, if **Rxg7**, then **Qxh6+!**\n  - **Kg8** (only) **Qh7#** \u2014 beautiful mate.\n\nSo **Ng7** threatens **Qxh6+** followed by **Qh7#** if the rook takes.\n\nBut what if Black doesn\u2019t take?\n\nAfter **Ng7**, Black must deal with the threat of **Rxg7 Qxh6+ Kg8 Qh7#**.\n\nSo Black must prevent the capture on g7.\n\nOptions:\n\n- **Rf8** \u2014 move the h8 rook? But h8 rook is pinned? No \u2014 king on h8, rook on h8 \u2014 not pinned.\n  - But if **Rf8**, then **Nxh8** wins the rook \u2014 material gain.\n- **Rc8** \u2014 to defend g8? But **Ng7** is on g7, so **Rc8** doesn\u2019t help.\n- **Kg8** \u2014 king moves to g8?\n  - Then **Nxh8** wins rook \u2014 but is that good?\n    - After **Kg8**, **Nxh8** Kxh8 \u2014 equal material, but White has initiative.\n    - But better: **Qb8+!** \u2014 now **Rc8** (only) **Qb7** \u2014 winning the rook on c7? Because now **Qb7** attacks c7.\n      - If **Rc8**, **Qb7** pins and wins the rook.\n      - So **Qb8+ Rc8 Qb7** \u2014 wins a rook.\n\nBut even better: after **Ng7**, if **Kg8**, then **Qb8+! Rc8 Qb7** \u2014 wins the rook on c7.\n\nAlternatively, if Black plays **Rf8** to defend g8, then **Nxh8 Kxh8**, and now **Qb8+ Kg7 Qxc7** \u2014 wins a rook.\n\nSo in all cases, **Ng7** wins material.\n\nBut is there an **immediate mate**?\n\nWait \u2014 what if after **Ng7**, Black plays **Qf6** to defend h8?\n\n- **Qg6-f6** \u2014 now defends h8.\n  - Then **Nxh8** Kxh8 \u2014 and no immediate mate.\n  - But **Qb8+ Rc8 Qb7** \u2014 again, wins the rook.\n\nSo still good.\n\nBut is there a **forced mate**?\n\nWait \u2014 back to **Bg7+**.\n\nEarlier I dismissed it, but let\u2019s re-examine.\n\n**1. Bg7+! Kxg7**\n\nNow, **2. Qe8!**\n\nThreatens **Qh8#**.\n\nBlack must prevent Qh8.\n\nOptions:\n- **Rc8** \u2014 blocks.\n  - **3. Qh8+ Kf6** (only, since Kg"
