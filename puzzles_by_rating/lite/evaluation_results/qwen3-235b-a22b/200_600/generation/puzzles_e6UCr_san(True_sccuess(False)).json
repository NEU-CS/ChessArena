        "content": "I am playing as White in this position.\n\nFEN: `8/k7/P7/1K3p2/8/8/8/8 w - - 0 65`\n\nWhite has a pawn on a6 and king on b5.  \nBlack has a king on a7 and pawn on f5 (but it's far away and irrelevant for now).  \nWhite is to move.\n\nGoal: Promote the a-pawn. The pawn is on a6, one square away from queening on a7, but currently blocked by the black king on a7. White must maneuver the king to support the pawn\u2019s promotion.\n\nCurrent legal moves: Kc6, Kc5, Ka5, Kc4, Kb4, Ka4\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each candidate:\n\n1. **Kc6**: Moves king to c6. This supports the pawn and advances toward the queenside. After Kc6, the idea is to play a7 next if possible. But after Kc6, Black plays ...Kb8, and then White can play Kb6, leading to promotion. This seems promising.\n\n2. **Kc5**: King moves to c5. Less direct. Allows king to support a6 but gives Black time to potentially counter with ...Kb7 or ...Kb8. Slower than Kc6.\n\n3. **Ka5**: Moving toward the pawn, but already on b5, so Ka5 is toward a6. But Ka5 attacks a6, which is occupied by own pawn. This doesn't help much. After Ka5, Black can play ...Kb8, and now White must retreat or shuffle. This may allow opposition issues.\n\n4. **Kc4, Kb4, Ka4**: These are retreating or sideways moves, losing ground. Not useful in a race to promote. They give Black time to potentially bring the king back more safely. These are likely inferior.\n\nBest plan: Use the king to force the black king away from a7 so that a7 can be played with check, then promote.\n\nCurrently, the black king is on a7, controlling a8 and b8. White wants to play a7+ at the right moment.\n\nTo do that, the white king must be on b6 when a7+ is played, so that after Kb8, White plays Kb6 and wins.\n\nBut to get there, White must gain the opposition.\n\nKey idea: White must lose a tempo or force Black into a position where they must yield the opposition.\n\nBut here, White can play **Kc6!** \u2014 this is the key move.\n\nAfter **Kc6**, Black must respond:\n\n- If ...Kb8, then **Kb6!** \u2014 now Black is in zugzwang. After Kb8, White plays a7+! and promotes.\n\n- If ...Kc8, then **Kb6!** again, threatening a7+. Black cannot stop it.\n\nBut wait: after **1. Kc6**, Black can play **1...Kb8**, then:\n\n2. Kb6 Kc8! \u2014 this is tricky. If 3. a7? Kd7! and the pawn is lost.\n\nWait \u2014 that\u2019s a problem.\n\nSo we must be careful.\n\nLet\u2019s re-analyze:\n\nAfter:\n\n1. Kc6 Kb8  \n2. Kb6 Kc8!  \n3. a7? Kd7! \u2014 yes, now the king attacks a7, and White loses the pawn.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nAlternative: White must approach with the king first, keeping the black king from counterattacking.\n\nBetter plan: **Ka5!**\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n1. Ka5! Kb8  \n2. Kb6! Kc8  \n3. a7! Kd7  \n4. Kc5! \u2014 now the king supports the pawn. Black cannot capture because of Kc5-b6-a7.\n\nAfter 4...Ke7 5. Kd5 Kf7 6. Ke5 Kg7 7. Kf5 Kh7 8. Kg5, White queens.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after 1. Ka5, Black can play **Kb7!**, defending the a7 square.\n\n1. Ka5 Kb7!  \nNow White cannot play Kb5 because of ...Kc7, and if Kc5, Black can go to c7 or b8.\n\nBut now, White can play **Kc5!** \u2014 yes.\n\nAfter 1. Ka5 Kb7 2. Kc5! \u2014 now the king is centralizing.\n\nBut Black can play ...Kc7, and then Kd5, etc., but White can still push.\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nWait \u2014 the correct theoretical move here is **Kc5!** or **Kc6!**?\n\nLet me recall: in king and pawn vs king, with pawn on a6 and kings near, the key is to gain the opposition.\n\nStandard technique: **Kc5!** is the correct move.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n1. Kc5! Kb8  \n2. Kc6! Kc8  \n3. Kb6! \u2014 now Black is in zugzwang.\n\nIf 3...Kd8, then 4. a7! and the pawn queens.\n\nIf 3...Kb8, then 4. a7+! Ka8 5. Kc7 and queens.\n\nBut after 1. Kc5, Black can play **Kb7!**\n\n1. Kc5 Kb7  \n2. Kc6! \u2014 now White gains the opposition.\n\nIf 2...Kc8, then 3. Kb6! \u2014 same as before.\n\nIf 2...Kb8, then 3. Kb6! Kc8 4. a7! and wins.\n\nSo yes \u2014 **Kc5** is strong.\n\nBut what about **Kc6**?\n\n1. Kc6 Kb8  \n2. Kb6 Kc8  \n3. a7? \u2014 loses to Kd7 as before.\n\nNo \u2014 after 1. Kc6 Kb8, White should not play Kb6 immediately.\n\nAfter 1. Kc6, if 1...Kb8, then 2. Kd7! \u2014 wait, no, Kd7 is not possible.\n\nKc6 to d7? That\u2019s not a legal move from c6.\n\nFrom c6, king can go to b6, b5, c5, d5, d6, b7? No \u2014 b7 is attacked by black king? No, b7 is empty.\n\nWait \u2014 after 1. Kc6, Black plays 1...Kb8\n\nNow White can play 2. Kc5! \u2014 retreating to c5, gaining the opposition.\n\nThen 2...Kc8 3. Kc6! Kb8 4. Kb6! and wins.\n\nBut that\u2019s slower.\n\nThe most direct and correct move is **Ka5!**\n\nWait \u2014 let's check endgame tablebase knowledge.\n\nIn this position: White king on b5, pawn on a6; Black king on a7.\n\nThe winning move is **Kc5!** or **Kc6!**?\n\nActually, the key is to avoid stalemate and force the black king away.\n\nBest move: **Kc6!**\n\nAfter 1. Kc6!:\n\n- If 1...Kb8, then 2. Kc5! Kc8 3. Kc6! Kb8 4. Kb6! Kc8 5. a7! Kd7 6. Kd5! and White wins.\n\nBut after 1. Kc6 Kb8 2. Kc5, Black can play 2...Kb7!?\n\n2...Kb7! \u2014 then 3. Kc6? Kc8 \u2014 back to same.\n\nBut 3. Kb5! \u2014 White can go back to b5.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nI recall that in this exact position, the winning move is **Kc5!**\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Kc5! Kb8  \n2. Kb6! \u2014 but wait, from c5 to b6 is legal.\n\n1. Kc5 Kb8  \n2. Kb6! Kc8  \n3. a7! Kd7  \n4. Kd5! Ke7  \n5. Ke5! Kf7  \n6. Kf5! Kg7  \n7. Kg5! Kh7  \n8. h6? No, no h-pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 after a7, the pawn will queen soon.\n\nAfter 3. a7 Kd7  \n4. Kd5 Ke7  \n5. Ke5 Kf7  \n6. Kf5 Kg7  \n7. Kg5 Kh7  \n8. Kh5 Kg7  \n9. Kh6! Kf7  \n10. Kh7! and the pawn queens.\n\nBut this is long.\n\nBut it wins.\n\nBut after 1. Kc5, Black can play 1...Kb7!\n\nThen:\n\n2. Kb5! Kc7  \n3. Kc5! \u2014 now White gains the opposition.\n\nThen 3...Kd7 4. Kd5! Ke7 5. Ke5! Kf7 6. Kf5! Kg7 7. Kg5! Kh7 8. Kh5! Kg7 9. Kh6! Kf7 10. Kh7! \u2014 same idea.\n\nBut the pawn is still on a6.\n\nAfter 3. Kc5, Black is forced back.\n\nBut there's a faster way.\n\nThe correct move is **Kc6!**\n\nLet me check"
