When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

It attacks the b6 square and supports ...f5.\n- But the most **immediate threat** is **...Re8+!**, forcing the king to h1 or f1, and then possibly ...Rh8 or ...Rf8, creating mating threats or winning the c5 pawn.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate **...Re8+** (e5e8):\n\nAfter **e5e8+**, White must play **Kf1** or **Kh1**. Let's say:\n1. ... Re8+  \n2. Kh1 (forced, since Kf1 allows ...Rf8+ and possibly ...Rh8#)\n\nNow Black has **...Rh8**, threatening ...Rh2 and mate on h1. Also, the rook can swing to the queenside if needed.\n\nAlternatively, **...Re7** (e5e7) also puts pressure on the 7th rank, but it's less forcing.\n\nBut **...Re8+** is a **check**, gains initiative, and leads to a strong attack.\n\nIs there a refutation?\n\nAfter:\n- ... Re8+  \n- Kh1  \n- ... Rh8!  \nNow White has no good defense. If g3, then ...Rh3, threatening mate. If f3, ...Rh3 again. If h3, ...Rh5, and Black can double on the h-file or bring the king up.\n\nAlso, note that the c5 pawn is **undefended**! After Re8+ Kh1 Rh8, White cannot save the c5 pawn because:\n- If Rb1, then ...Rh3, still threatening mate.\n- But more importantly, after ...Rh8, the pawn on c5 falls to ...Rxc5.\n\nSo **...Re8+** wins a pawn **and** creates a mating attack.\n\nCompare to other moves:\n- ...b6? Blunt, allows cxb6 and weakens c6.\n- ...g5? Might be useful later, but not urgent.\n- ...Re6? Solid, but not as strong as the check.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is **...Re8+**, which forces the king to h1 and wins the c5 pawn with a strong attack.\n\n```\ne5e8\n```"
