When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Let me assess the position:\n\nKey observations:\n- Black's king is in the center, but the rooks are connected on the back rank\n- White has a bishop on e3 that's attacking the black bishop on f3, which is a hanging piece\n- Qxf3 is a legal move and captures the undefended bishop\n- After Qxf3, Black would likely play ...O-O, but that would lose material to Qxh6\n- The black king would be very exposed after castling due to the open h-file and white's pieces targeting h6\n\nLet me evaluate Qxf3:\n- This wins a piece immediately (the bishop on f3)\n- After Qxf3, if Black castles with ...O-O, then Qxh6 wins a pawn with a strong attack\n- Black's king would be extremely vulnerable on g8 with white's queen on h6 and potential rook lifts\n- Even if Black doesn't castle, they're down a piece and have no compensation\n\nOther candidate moves like Bxh6 or Qa4+ don't offer the same immediate material gain and strong attack.\n\nQxf3 seems to be the best move - it wins a piece and gives white a decisive advantage with a strong attack developing.\n\n```\nQxf3\n```"
