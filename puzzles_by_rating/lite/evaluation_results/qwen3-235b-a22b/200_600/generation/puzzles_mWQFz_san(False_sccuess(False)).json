        "content": "The current position is a king and pawn versus king endgame. White has a pawn on b4 and king on b5, while Black has a king on g4 and pawn on h5. It's White to move.\n\nFEN: `8/8/8/1K5p/1P4k1/8/8/8 w - - 1 52`\n\nWhite's goal is to promote the b-pawn. The key is to advance the pawn safely while keeping the opposition or preventing Black's king from stopping the promotion.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the candidate moves:\n\n- **b5c6**: Moves king to c6. This supports b4-b5, but allows Black to potentially approach with ...g4-f5 or ...g4-f4, and White may lose control.\n- **b5b6**: Pushes the pawn. After b4-b5, Black can play ...g4-f5, aiming to stop the pawn. But b5-b6 is premature? Wait \u2014 b4-b5 is not yet played. This is b5-b6? No \u2014 the pawn is on b4, king on b5. So **b5b6** is king moving to b6, not pawn push. The pawn push would be **b4b5**, but that's not in the legal moves list.\n\nWait \u2014 legal moves are only king moves: b5c6, b5b6, b5a6, b5c5, b5a5, b5c4, b5a4.\n\nSo the pawn is on b4, and it's not its turn to move \u2014 we must move the king.\n\nWe need to prepare the advance of the b-pawn to b5, then b6, and promote.\n\nBut we must ensure that after b4-b5, Black cannot capture or stop it.\n\nCurrently, if White plays b4-b5 immediately, Black plays ...g4-f5, attacking the pawn. But b4-b5 is not a legal move listed \u2014 so perhaps it's not allowed? Or is it?\n\nWait \u2014 the legal moves provided are only king moves. That means **b4-b5** is not considered a legal move? But why?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check the position:\n\n- White king: b5\n- White pawn: b4\n- Black king: g4\n- Black pawn: h5\n\nIt's White to move.\n\nThe pawn on b4 should be able to move to b5, unless it's blocked. But b5 is occupied by the white king.\n\nAh! That's the issue \u2014 the white king is on b5, and the pawn is on b4. So the pawn cannot advance to b5 because the square is occupied.\n\nTherefore, White must move the king first to allow the pawn to advance.\n\nSo the immediate goal is to move the king to allow b4-b5.\n\nBest squares for the king: a5, c5, or b6 \u2014 supporting the pawn.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate:\n\n- **b5a5**: King moves to a5. Then next move can play b4-b5. From a5, the king supports b5. But after b4-b5, Black plays ...g4-f5, trying to race. But White can then play king to a6 or b6, and support b5-b6.\n\n- **b5c5**: King to c5 \u2014 also supports b4-b5. But it's moving away from the queenside, possibly less optimal.\n\n- **b5b6**: King to b6 \u2014 prepares to support b4-b5 as well. But after b4-b5, Black may still play ...g4-f5.\n\nBut we must consider the **opposition** and **zugzwang**.\n\nHowever, the critical point is: after White plays b4-b5, Black will try to capture or blockade.\n\nBut b5 will be occupied by a pawn after b4-b5, so Black king cannot occupy b5.\n\nBut Black doesn't need to \u2014 if Black king reaches c6 or c5, it can capture on b4 if the pawn is not protected.\n\nSo White must ensure that after b4-b5, the pawn is protected.\n\nTherefore, the king must be on a5, c5, or b6 to protect b5 after b4-b5.\n\nSo any of those squares work.\n\nBut we must also prevent Black from advancing the h-pawn or creating counterplay.\n\nBlack's h5 pawn is on the h-file, and king on g4 \u2014 it's a potential passed pawn, but far away.\n\nWhite is closer to promoting.\n\nBest plan: move king to a5 or c5, then play b4-b5 (with protection), then b5-b6, and promote.\n\nNow, which king move is best?\n\nLet\u2019s consider **b5a5**:\n\n- King to a5. Then next move b4-b5. Black plays ...g4-f5. White plays Ka5-a6. Now if Black takes on b5, then Ka6xb5, and White is free to capture h5 and win. If Black doesn't take, White plays b5-b6, and promotes.\n\nBut after b4-b5, if Black plays ...Kf5, then White plays Ka5-a6.\n\nNow, if Black plays ...Kf4, White plays b5-b6, then b6-b7, etc.\n\nBut Black might play ...Kg4 again? No, it's moving away.\n\nAlternatively, **b5c5** is symmetric, but the king is farther from the a-file, which might matter if the pawn promotes and we need to stop the h-pawn.\n\nBut actually, after promotion, White can quickly deal with h5.\n\nBut **b5a5** is better because it keeps the king on the queenside and avoids centralizing unnecessarily.\n\nNow, what about **b5b6**?\n\nKing to b6. Then b4-b5 is supported. But after b4-b5, Black plays ...g4-f5. Then White can play b5-b6, but pawn on b6, king on b6? No \u2014 king on b6, pawn on b5. Then b5-b6 would require king to move.\n\nWait: after Kc5 or Ka5, you play b4-b5, then king moves to b6 or a6, then b5-b6.\n\nBut if king is already on b6, then after b4-b5, the pawn is on b5, king on b6 \u2014 then you can play b5-b6 only if king moves away, but then the pawn is unprotected.\n\nSo king on b6 is **behind** the pawn \u2014 not ideal.\n\nWhereas king on a5 or c5 is **beside** the pawn, ready to support its advance.\n\nSo **b5a5** or **b5c5** are better.\n\nNow, which is better: a5 or c5?\n\nThe black king is on g4, heading toward the queenside. By playing **b5a5**, we stay on the same side as the pawn, minimizing Black's chances.\n\nc5 is more central, but not necessary.\n\nAlso, a5 is closer to a7 and b7, which are promotion squares.\n\nMoreover, if we go to c5, Black might play ...g4-f5, then ...f5-e5, and race toward b4.\n\nBut with king on a5, we can play b4-b5 immediately next move.\n\nAfter **b5a5**, Black is in zugzwang-like situation.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n1. b5a5! Kg4-f5 (trying to stop the pawn)\n\n2. b4-b5! Kf5-e5\n\n3. Ka5-a6! Ke5-d6\n\n4. b5-b6 Kd6-c6\n\n5. Ka6-a7! Kc6-b7\n\n6. b6-b7 Kb7xb7\n\n7. Ka7xb7 \u2014 and White wins.\n\nIf after 3. Ka5-a6, Black doesn\u2019t play ...Ke5-d6, but instead ...h5-h4, then White plays b5-b6, and promotes first.\n\nWhite promotes in 4 moves: b4-b5, b5-b6, b6-b7, b7-b8=Q.\n\nBlack needs 5 moves to promote: h5-h4, h4-h3, h3-h2, h2-h1=Q \u2014 but White will check or stop it.\n\nBut in this line, White promotes first.\n\nAlternatively, if after 1. b5a5, Black plays ...h5-h4, then White plays 2. b4-b5! and proceeds as before \u2014 Black king is too far.\n\nSo **b5a5** is strong.\n\nNow, what about **b5c5**? Similar, but king is on c5.\n\nAfter 1. b5c5, b4-b5, then Black plays ...g4-f5, White plays Kc5-d6? Or Kc5-b6.\n\nBut Kb6 is possible.\n\nBut a5 is slightly better because it\u2019s closer to the a-file and avoids any stalemate or misstep.\n\nAlso, in some lines, if king is on c5, Black might threaten ...Kd5 or ...Kc6, but not really.\n\nBut **b5a5** is the most direct and safe.\n\nNow, what about **b5b6**? As said, king behind the pawn \u2014 bad.\n\n**b5a6**? King to a6 \u2014 too far, and doesn't support b5.\n\n**b5c6**, **b5c4**, **b5a4** \u2014 all too far or backward.\n\nSo best move is **b5"
