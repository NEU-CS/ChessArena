When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

No obvious material imbalances.\n\n**King Safety:**\n- **White's king** is in the center (e1), but castling is still possible (KQ rights).\n- **Black's king** is on g7 \u2014 somewhat exposed, especially along the h-file and diagonal from Bg5 ideas.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- White has a **Bishop on h5**, which is actively placed, pinning the f7-pawn indirectly and eyeing g6.\n- Black has just played ...g6? No \u2014 actually, the pawn is on g7, and ...g6 hasn't been played. Wait: Black's king is on g7 \u2014 that means they likely moved the king from g8 to g7, possibly to avoid a back-rank mate or to prepare ...f5.\n\nWait \u2014 let's reconstruct the position:\n\n- Black king on g7\n- White bishop on h5 \u2014 **this bishop is attacking g6**, and if Black ever plays ...g6, it would be bad due to Bxg6.\n\nBut currently, **the bishop on h5 is attacking the g6 square**, and **if it captures on g6**, it would be:\n\n**h5xg6** \u2014 removing the pawn that is currently not there.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a pawn on g6?\n\nLooking at the FEN:  \n`r1b2r2/pp1n2kp/2n2qp1/2ppp2B/3P4/2P1P3/PP1N1PP1/R2QK1NR`\n\nLet\u2019s break it down by ranks:\n\n- **8th rank**: r1b2r2 \u2192 Rook, empty, Bishop, empty, empty, Rook, empty, empty\n- **7th rank**: pp1n2kp \u2192 pawn, pawn, empty, knight, empty, empty, king, pawn\n- **6th rank**: 2n2qp1 \u2192 empty, empty, knight, empty, empty, queen, pawn, empty\n- **5th rank**: 2ppp2B \u2192 empty, empty, pawn, pawn, pawn, empty, empty, Bishop\n- etc.\n\nSo:\n- **g7**: pawn (from 7th rank: ...kp \u2192 king on f7? Wait \u2014 no!)\n\nWait \u2014 **7th rank**: `pp1n2kp`\n\nThat\u2019s:\n- a7: p\n- b7: p\n- c7: empty\n- d7: n\n- e7: empty\n- f7: empty\n- g7: k\n- h7: p\n\nSo **Black king is on g7**, **no pawn on g6** \u2014 g6 is empty.\n\n**6th rank**: `2n2qp1` \u2192 a6: empty, b6: empty, c6: n, d6: empty, e6: empty, f6: q, g6: p, h6: empty\n\nAh! **g6 has a pawn** \u2014 so black has a pawn on g6.\n\nSo the bishop on h5 is **attacking the g6 pawn**, which is defended by the king on g7.\n\nSo **Bxg6** is a possible capture.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **h5g6** \u2014 that is, Bxg6.\n\nIf **Bxg6**, then:\n- Black can recapture with **Kxg6**\n- Then White can play **Qd1-g4+**, attacking the king and threatening mate on h5 or g7.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate:\n\n1. **Bxg6** \u2192 Kxg6\n2. **Qg4+** \u2192 Kh6 (only move, probably)\n   - Then **Qg5+** \u2192 Kg6\n   - But that just repeats.\n\nWait \u2014 better:\n\nAfter 1. Bxg6 Kxg6  \n2. Qg4+ Kh6  \nNow 3. **Qg5+** \u2192 Kg6, back again.\n\nBut is there a follow-up?\n\nAlternatively, after 2...Kh6, play **Nh3!**, threatening Ng5 or Nf4, increasing pressure.\n\nBut perhaps better is to **check with the queen and bring pieces into the attack**.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: is **Bxg6** safe?\n\nAfter **Bxg6 Kxg6**, White has:\n\n- Opened the h-file\n- Black king exposed\n- Queen can come to g4 with check\n- Also, knight on g1 can go to f3 or h3, supporting attack\n\nBut is there a **tactical refutation**?\n\nWhat if after **Bxg6 Kxg6**, Black plays **Qf5**, defending h5 and preparing ...f6 or ...e4?\n\nBut White can play **Qg4+**, forcing the king to h6, and then **Nf3** or **Nh3**, increasing pressure.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider **tactical shots**.\n\nWait \u2014 is **Qh5** possible? No, queen is on d1.\n\nBut after **Bxg6**, we get:\n\n- King exposed\n- h-file open\n- Queen to g4 with check\n\nThis looks promising.\n\nBut let\u2019s check if **Bxg6** is winning.\n\nAlternative idea: **Qd1-g4** \u2014 is that possible?\n\nYes: **d1g4** is in the legal moves list.\n\nBut after **Qg4**, Black plays **Qxg4**, and we recapture with h3? No knight on h3.\n\nWe have knight on g1 \u2014 so **Nxg4**, but then knight is offside.\n\nAnd we lose the bishop on h5.\n\nSo **Qg4** is bad \u2014 loses the bishop.\n\nSo **Bxg6** is better \u2014 sacrifice to expose the king.\n\nLet\u2019s go back.\n\n### Candidate move: **h5g6** \u2014 Bxg6\n\nAfter:\n1. h5g6 Kxg6  \n2. Qg4+ Kh6  \n3. Qg5+ Kg6  \n4. Qg4+ \u2014 draw by repetition?\n\nBut we don\u2019t want a draw.\n\nCan we play **Nh3** instead?\n\nAfter 2...Kh6, play **Nh3!**, threatening **Nf4+** or **Ng5**, with deadly threats.\n\nFor example:\n- 3. Nh3 e4? 4. Nf4+ Kh5 5. g4+! Nxg4 6. Nxg4 \u2014 but knight is gone.\n\nWait \u2014 better: after 3. Nh3, if Black doesn\u2019t stop Ng5, then Ng5 attacks f7 and threatens mate.\n\nBut f7 is only defended by king.\n\nAfter Ng5, if ...h6, then Nh7 forks king and rook.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n1. Bxg6 Kxg6  \n2. Qg4+ Kh6  \n3. Nh3! \u2014 now threat is Ng5, then Nf7 or Nh7.\n\nBlack must prevent Ng5.\n\nSo Black might play **h5** to block.\n\nBut after **...h5**, Qg5+! \u2014 forcing the king to h7, then Nxh5!?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s not get ahead.\n\nBut the point is: **Bxg6** opens a strong attack.\n\nIs there a better move?\n\n### Other candidate: **d4e5** \u2014 push the d-pawn.\n\nAfter dxe5, Nxe5 \u2014 knight comes to e5, centralizing.\n\nBut Black can play ...Nf3+ or ...Ng4, disrupting.\n\nNot as forcing.\n\n### **d2f3** \u2014 Nf3, developing.\n\nBut we already have a bishop on h5 \u2014 better to exploit that.\n\n### **g1f3** \u2014 same.\n\nBut **Bxg6** seems most forcing.\n\n### Is there a **tactical refutation** of **Bxg6**?\n\nAfter:\n1. Bxg6 Kxg6  \n2. Qg4+ Kh6  \n3. Qg5+ Kg6 \u2014 draw?\n\nBut we can avoid repetition.\n\nInstead of 3. Qg5+, play **Nf3!**, developing with tempo.\n\nAfter 2...Kh6, play **Nf3**, threatening Ng5.\n\nFor example:\n- 3. Nf3 e4 4. Ne5! \u2014 attacking f7 and g4\n- If ...Qf5, then 5. Qxf5 exf5, and we have Ng5+ or Nf7\n\nBut Ng5+ is check: 5...Kh5 6. g4+! fxg4 7. Nf7 \u2014 winning material.\n\nBut let\u2019s not get too deep.\n\nThe point is: **Bxg6** leads to a strong attack, and Black\u2019s king is very exposed.\n\nMoreover, **it\u2019s the only move that creates immediate threats**.\n\nOther moves are slow.\n\n### Are there any defensive resources for Black?\n\nAfter Bxg6 Kxg6 Qg4+ Kh6, if Black tries **...f5**, then Qh4+! g5 fxg6 \u2014 but messy.\n\nBut **...f5** blocks the queen\u2019s escape.\n\nBut"
