Rxb8?**\n- Takes a bishop: `Rxb8 Bxb8`\n- But then Black recaptures with the other bishop: `Bxb8`, and we lose the initiative.\n- We trade rook for bishop, which is not good.\n- **No, this is a blunder in terms of material. Avoid.**\n\n#### **2. c6?**\n- Pushes the pawn, attacking d7.\n- But d7 is empty. After `c6`, Black plays `Bxc6!`, winning the pawn.\n- Then `Rd8+` or similar may happen. We lose a pawn for no compensation.\n- **Not good.**\n\n#### **3. Ba5 / Bb4 / Bd2 / Bb2 / Bd4** \u2014 Bishop maneuvers\n- **Ba5** attacks the b6 square and eyes c7. Could support a future c6 push.\n- **Bd4** is very strong \u2014 controls key central squares, supports e5, eyes h8.\n- **Bb4** pins nothing, but could be rerouted.\n- **Bd4** looks especially strong \u2014 it centralizes the bishop, supports a potential rook lift, and prepares to pressure along the d-file.\n\n#### **4. Rook moves: Rb7, Rb6, Rb5, Rd1, Re1, Rc1, etc.**\n- **Rb5** attacks the d5 pawn? No \u2014 it's **White** who has the pawn on c5 and e5, **Black has a rook on d5**!\n  Wait \u2014 **FEN says: 2PrP3** \u2014 that means **Black has a rook on d5**!\n\nAh! Important: **Black has a rook on d5**, which is **attacking our c5 pawn**.\n\nSo: **c5 is under attack by Rook on d5**.\n\nTherefore, **c5 is hanging unless supported**.\n\nOur bishop on c3 supports c5.\n\nSo if we move the bishop, **c5 falls** unless we have another defender.\n\nSo: **Any bishop move off the c3-h8 diagonal loses c5**.\n\nFor example:\n- `Bd4??` \u2192 `Rd5xc5` \u2014 we lose a pawn.\n- Similarly, `Bb4??` \u2192 `Rxd5` wins c5.\n\nSo **only safe bishop moves are those that keep control of c5** \u2014 that is, along the diagonal: **Ba5, Bb2, Be1, Ba1** \u2014 but **Bd2** also controls c5?\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n- **Bishop on d2**: does it control c5? No \u2014 c5 is on the c-file, d2 to c5 is not same diagonal.\n  - c5 is on c5 \u2014 bishop on c3 controls a1-h8 diagonal: a1, b2, c3, d4, e5, f6, g7, h8.\n  - So only squares on that diagonal support c5.\n\nSo bishop moves that **stay on the diagonal** or **don\u2019t leave c5 undefended** are:\n- **Ba5** \u2014 on the diagonal? a5 is not on c3-h8. c3 to h8 is c3-d4-e5-f6-g7-h8. a5 is on a5-b4-c3-d2-e1 \u2014 that\u2019s the other diagonal.\n  - So **Ba5** is on the **a5-e1 diagonal**, which **does pass through c3**, so yes \u2014 **Ba5 is still on the same diagonal as c3**, so it still controls c5?\n  - From a5 to c5: a5-b5-c5 \u2014 that\u2019s horizontal, not diagonal.\n  - Diagonally, a5 to c3 is a diagonal (a5-b4-c3), but **from a5 to c5 is not diagonal**.\n  - So **Ba5 does NOT protect c5**.\n\nWait \u2014 **c5 is on c5**, bishop on c3 protects c5 because it's on the same file? No \u2014 bishops don\u2019t move by files.\n\n**Bishop on c3** protects along diagonals:\n- a1-h8: a1, b2, c3, d4, e5, f6, g7, h8\n- a5-e1: a5, b4, c3, d2, e1\n\nSo **c5 is not on either diagonal**.\n\nWait \u2014 this is critical.\n\n**Does the bishop on c3 protect c5?**\n\n- c3 to c5 is **same file**, but **bishop moves diagonally**, not vertically.\n- So **bishop on c3 does NOT protect c5**.\n\nThen why is c5 not hanging?\n\nLet\u2019s look: **c5 has a white pawn**. Black has a **rook on d5**, which is on d5.\n\nCan the rook take on c5? d5 to c5 is one square left \u2014 yes, rooks move horizontally.\n\nSo **Rd5 can capture c5** \u2014 **if it is undefended**.\n\nSo **is c5 defended**?\n\nWho defends c5?\n- Not the bishop on c3 (not on same diagonal/file in a way that helps \u2014 wait, rook files: c-file.\n- The **b1 rook** is on b1 \u2014 it controls the b-file, not c-file.\n- Unless the rook moves to c1, it doesn't defend c5.\n- **No piece currently defends c5**.\n\nWait \u2014 **c5 pawn is on c5**, attacked by **Rd5**, and **no white piece defends it**.\n\nSo **c5 is hanging**.\n\nBut the FEN says it's White to move \u2014 so Black didn\u2019t just take it, meaning perhaps it's defended?\n\nWait \u2014 let's double-check the FEN: `2PrP3` \u2014 that means:\n- 2 squares empty\n- **P** = white pawn? No \u2014 in FEN, uppercase is white, lowercase is black.\n\nWait \u2014 **FEN notation**:\n- `2PrP3` \u2014 this is the 4th rank.\n- So: two empty squares, then **P** (white pawn), then **r** (black rook), then **P** (white pawn), then three empty.\n\nSo: **c4 = white pawn**, d4 = black rook, e4 = white pawn?\n\nNo \u2014 ranks are from 8 to 1.\n\nFEN: `1bb3k1/5ppp/p3p3/2PrP3/8/2B5/5PPP/1R4K1`\n\nBreakdown:\n- 8th rank: 1bb3k1 \u2192 a8=empty, b8=B, c8=B, d8=empty, e8=empty, f8=empty, g8=K, h8=empty\n- 7th: 5ppp \u2192 five empty, f7=p, g7=p, h7=p\n- 6th: a6=p, then 3 empty, e6=p, then 3 empty? Wait: `a3p3` \u2192 no: `a3p3` would be a6=p, b6=empty, c6=empty, d6=empty, e6=p, f6=empty, g6=empty, h6=empty? But it's `a3p3` \u2014 no, it's `a3p3` \u2192 actually: `a6=p`, then 3 empty, then `p` on e6? No: `a3p3` means: a6=p, b6=empty, c6=empty, d6=empty, e6=p? But it's written as `a3p3` \u2014 wait, the string is `a3p3`? No: the FEN says `a3p3` \u2014 no: it says `a3p3` \u2014 wait:"
