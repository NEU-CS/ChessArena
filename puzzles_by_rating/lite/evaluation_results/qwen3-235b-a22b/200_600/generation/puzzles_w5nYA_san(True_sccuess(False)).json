No \u2014 b1 knight is missing from the board, but it's on b1 in FEN \u2014 wait: FEN says `RN2KB1R` on first rank: so a1=R, b1=N, then two empty, then K on e1, B on f1, then g1 and h1 empty \u2014 so king-side rook is still on h1. So White has both rooks, knight on b1, bishop on f1, and the c4 bishop is actually on d4 (Bd4). Wait \u2014 the piece on d4 is Bd4.\n\nWait \u2014 FEN: `2kr1bnr/pp3ppp/8/2p5/3B2b1/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R`\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct:\n\n- **White pieces:**\n  - King: e1\n  - Rooks: a1, h1\n  - Knights: b1\n  - Bishops: d4, f1\n  - Pawns: c3, a2, b2, f2, g2, h2\n\n- **Black pieces:**\n  - King: c8 (in the corner? Wait: `2kr1bnr` \u2014 so on a8: empty, b8: empty, c8: king, d8: rook, e8: empty, f8: bishop, g8: knight, h8: rook. So Black king is on c8 \u2014 unusual, likely castled queenside but king moved to c8? Or never castled? But rook is on d8, which is odd.\n\nWait: `2kr1bnr` \u2014 that's:\n- a8: empty\n- b8: empty\n- c8: king\n- d8: rook\n- e8: empty\n- f8: bishop\n- g8: knight\n- h8: rook\n\nSo Black king is on c8, rook on d8 \u2014 this suggests Black has played ...O-O-O but then moved the king to c8? Or perhaps the rook came to d8 via Rd8 and king never castled? But king is on c8 \u2014 that\u2019s not standard. Possibly Black played ...Kc7 and then ...Kc8? But now it's c8.\n\nAnyway, king is on c8 \u2014 exposed, no pawn shield. This is **very dangerous** for Black.\n\nWhite has a bishop on d4, eyeing the long diagonal. Black has a bishop on g4, pinning nothing because Nf3 isn't there. White has not developed much: knight on b1, king stuck, rooks on a1 and h1.\n\nBut: **White to move**, and there is a **tactical opportunity**.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **Bxg7** \u2014 that\u2019s one of the legal moves.\n\n### Candidate move: **Bxg7**\n\n- Bxg7: White takes on g7.\n- Black\u2019s knight is on f8, so it can recapture with Nxg7.\n- But after Bxg7 Nxg7, what happens?\n\nThen White can play **Be5!**, forking king and rook: Be5 attacks both c7 (where king is on c8) and the rook on h8.\n\nWait: Be5 from where? After Bxg7, the bishop is gone. The other bishop is on f1. So **Be5** would be with the f1 bishop.\n\nYes: after **1. Bxg7 Nxg7 2. Be5!**, the bishop on e5 attacks:\n- The king on c8 (via diagonal a1\u2013h8: e5\u2013c7\u2013b8? No \u2014 e5 to c7 is two squares down and two left \u2014 that\u2019s diagonal? e5\u2013d6\u2013c7 \u2014 yes, c7 is attacked. King is on c8.\n\nWait: **c8** \u2014 is c8 attacked by a bishop on e5?\n\n- e5 \u2192 d6 \u2192 c7 \u2192 b8: that\u2019s the diagonal. So e5 attacks c7, but **not c8**.\n\nc8 is one square above c7 \u2014 not on the same diagonal.\n\nSo **Be5 does not attack the king on c8**.\n\ne5 attacks:\n- Along the diagonal: f6, g7, h8 (up-right)\n- And down-left: d4, c3, b2, a1 \u2014 and also c7, b6, a5.\n\nBut **c8 is not on that diagonal** \u2014 it's one square north of c7.\n\nSo **Be5 does not give check**.\n\nBut it **attacks the rook on h8** \u2014 yes, h8 is on e5\u2013h8 diagonal.\n\nSo after 1. Bxg7 Nxg7 2. Be5, White wins a rook for a bishop.\n\nBut Black can play ...f6 or ...Bf5 to block or ...Rd7 to protect h8?\n\nWait \u2014 Black\u2019s rook is on h8, and Be5 attacks it.\n\nBut Black has a rook on d8 \u2014 so if White plays Be5, Black can play ...Rd7, defending h8 via ...Rd7-h7.\n\nBut ...Rd7 takes a tempo.\n\nAlternatively, after Bxg7 Nxg7, White can play **Qa4+!** \u2014 but wait, queen is not developed.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a queen move listed in legal moves \u2014 so queen must be on d1, but no queen move is legal? That can\u2019t be.\n\nWait \u2014 legal moves listed: `Bxg7, Bf6, Be5, Bxc5, Be3, Rg1, Ba6, Bb5, Bc4, Bd3, Be2, Kd2, Na3, Nd2, c4, h3, g3, f3, b3, a3, h4, f4, b4, a4`\n\nNo queen moves. So queen must be blocked. Probably on d1, blocked by knight or pawn.\n\nBut knight is on b1, so queen can go to d2, d3, etc. But not listed. So maybe queen is not free.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the queen is on d1, and no queen move is legal because of pin or something? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the queen was captured? But FEN doesn't show it.\n\nFEN: `2kr1bnr/pp3ppp/8/2p5/3B2b1/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R`\n\nNo queen on board? Wait \u2014 in FEN, queens are 'Q' and 'q'. There is no 'Q' in the white pieces.\n\nWhite\u2019s first rank: `RN2KB1R` \u2014 R, N, (empty)x2, K, B, (empty)x2, R \u2014 so no queen. So **White has no queen**?\n\nThat\u2019s possible \u2014 maybe it was captured earlier.\n\nSimilarly, Black has no queen either \u2014 second rank: `pp3ppp` \u2014 no queen on back rank.\n\nSo both queens are off the board.\n\nOkay, so material is roughly equal, no queens.\n\nBack to **Bxg7**.\n\n1. Bxg7 Nxg7\n\nNow White can play **Be5**, attacking the h8 rook.\n\nBlack\u2019s moves: ...Rd7 protects h8; ...f6 blocks the diagonal; ...Bf5 blocks; ...Rc8? But king is on c8.\n\nRd7 is best.\n\nAfter 1. Bxg7 Nxg7 2. Be5 Rd7, White has won a pawn (g7) and traded bishop for knight, but now the bishop is on e5, which is strong.\n\nBut is it worth it?\n\nAlternatively, **Bxc5!** \u2014 winning a pawn immediately.\n\nBxc5: takes a pawn, but Black plays ...Rxc5, and now White has lost a bishop for a pawn.\n\nBut then White can play **Rd1**, attacking the rook.\n\nBut Black can play ...Rd5, or ...Rc8, etc.\n\nBut after Bxc5 Rxc5, White has no immediate follow-up.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: **Be5** \u2014 why is it a legal move? From f1 to e5? Yes, diagonal.\n\nBut is it strong?\n\nBe5 attacks h8 rook \u2014 yes.\n\nBut Black can play ...Bf5, blocking.\n\nOr ...f6.\n\nBut if White plays **Bf6**, that\u2019s another idea.\n\n**Bf6**: attacks g7, but g7 is defended by ...f7.\n\nBut if Bf6, Black plays ...gxf6? Then White has doubled pawns, but opened file.\n\nBut no immediate tactic.\n\nWait \u2014 **Bxc5** might be better.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at **Ba6** \u2014 attacking the rook on d8? Ba6 attacks a6\u2013d8 diagonal.\n\nYes! **Ba6**!\n\n- Ba6: bishop goes to a6, attacking the rook on d8.\n- Black cannot ignore it \u2014 if Black doesn\u2019t move the rook, White takes it.\n- Black\u2019s king is on c"
