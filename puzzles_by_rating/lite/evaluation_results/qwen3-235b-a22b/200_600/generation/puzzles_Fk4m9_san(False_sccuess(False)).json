When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully.\n\n### FEN: `8/4Rpnp/1k2p1p1/1Np1P3/r7/4BN2/1PP2PPP/6K1 w - - 0 29`\n\nWhite to move.\n\n---\n\n### Material:\n- White has a rook on e7, knight on b5, knight on f3, bishop on e3, pawns on c2, b2, c7, f2, g2, h2.\n- Black has a rook on a4, knight on g7, pawn on g6, p7, e6, c5, king on b6.\n\nWhite has a rook on the 7th rank, which is very strong. Black\u2019s king is exposed on b6.\n\n---\n\n### Key Features:\n\n- **White's rook on e7** is attacking along the 7th rank. It\u2019s currently attacking the black knight on g7 and potentially threatening mate ideas if the king gets exposed.\n- The **knight on b5** is well-placed, eyeing c7 and d6, and potentially forking or forking away from the black king.\n- **Black\u2019s king on b6** is in the open. Any checks or threats against it must be considered.\n- **White\u2019s bishop on e3** can become very dangerous if lines open. It points toward h6 and potentially at g7 or even the black king via a4-d7 diagonal if a4 is vacated.\n- **Black\u2019s rook on a4** is pinning the c2 pawn indirectly? No \u2014 no piece behind it. But it's attacking the b2 and c2 pawns.\n- **White\u2019s king is safe** on g1.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most forcing and powerful moves.\n\n#### 1. **e7e8?** \u2013 Promoting the rook? But e7-e8 would be **e7e8=Q?** but the move is listed as `e7e8`, which implies a rook move, but that square is occupied? Wait \u2014 no, e8 is empty.\n\nWait \u2014 **e7e8** is a legal move? Yes, but only if it's a rook move. But e8 is empty. So `e7e8` is a rook moving from e7 to e8. That\u2019s retreating? Not promoting.\n\nWait \u2014 **e7e8** is just moving the rook from e7 to e8. That seems passive.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **e7e8=Q** a legal move? That would be queen promotion. But the legal moves list includes `e7e8`, not `e7e8q`. So perhaps promotion is not allowed because it's not a pawn? Wait \u2014 **e7e8** is a rook move, not a pawn. So no promotion.\n\nSo `e7e8` is just Rre8 \u2014 moving the rook to e8. Not very strong.\n\nBetter options?\n\n#### 2. **e7f7** \u2013 Rxf7? That would capture the knight on f7? But f7 has a black knight? No \u2014 position: 8/4Rpnp \u2014 so 7th rank: 4Rpnp \u2192 so e7 is rook, f7 is p, g7 is n, h7 is p.\n\nSo f7 is a **black pawn**, not knight. So **e7f7** is Rxf7 \u2014 capturing a pawn.\n\nIs that good? Let's see:\n\n- After **Rxf7**, Black plays **Nxf7**, recapturing. Then White has **Rxf7**, but wait \u2014 no, White only has one rook. e7 is the only rook.\n\nWait \u2014 White has only one rook. So **Rxe7** was already played? No \u2014 the rook is on e7.\n\nSo **Rxf7** would be rook takes pawn on f7, then **Nxf7**, knight takes rook. Then White has knight on f3 and bishop on e3.\n\nBut then Black has knight on f7, which is not dangerous. But White gains a pawn.\n\nBut is it worth it? Probably not urgent.\n\n#### 3. **b5c7+** \u2013 Knight takes on c7 with check?\n\nc7 is occupied by a white pawn? No \u2014 in FEN: 8/4Rpnp/ \u2014 second rank is 4Rpnp \u2192 so e7 is rook, f7 pawn, g7 knight, h7 pawn.\n\nThird rank: 1k2p1p1 \u2192 b6 king, d6 empty, e6 pawn, f6 empty, g6 pawn, h6 empty.\n\nFourth rank: 1Np1P3 \u2192 b5 knight, c5 pawn, d5 empty, e5 pawn, rest empty.\n\nSo c7 is empty? 8/4Rpnp \u2014 first rank: 8 (empty), second: 4Rpnp \u2192 so positions: a7=empty, b7=empty, c7=empty, d7=empty, e7=R, f7=p, g7=n, h7=p.\n\nSo c7 is empty.\n\nSo **b5c7** is Nc7+, attacking the king on b6.\n\nLet\u2019s look at that.\n\n**Nc7+** \u2014 knight moves to c7, giving check.\n\nBlack king on b6 \u2014 is it in check?\n\nc7 is two up and one left from b6? b6 to c7 is one right, one up \u2014 yes, knight move.\n\nSo **Nc7+** is check.\n\nHow can Black respond?\n\n- King moves: b6-a7, b6-a6, b6-b5, b6-c6, b6-c7 (but c7 is attacked), so not c7.\n\nSo possible: Ka7, Kb5, Kc6.\n\nBut let\u2019s see:\n\nAfter **Nc7+**, Black plays:\n\n- **Ka7** \u2014 then White can play **Ra8+**? No rook on a-file.\n\nBut White has **Rb7** or **Rc7** idea.\n\nActually, **Nc7+ Ka7** \u2014 then **Rb7!** is crushing.\n\nRb7 attacks the king and threatens mate on a7.\n\nBlack must respond:\n\n- **Ka8** \u2014 then **Rb8#** \u2014 mate!\n\n- Or **Kb8** \u2014 same, **Rb7** attacks b8, but Kb8 is not possible from Ka7.\n\nFrom Ka7, after Rb7, Black can play:\n\n- **Kb8** \u2014 then **Rb7** attacks b8, so **Rb7+** is check, and **Rb7#** \u2014 yes, mate.\n\nWait: **Nc7+ Ka7 2. Rb7+ Kb8 3. Rb7#**? No \u2014 Rb7 is already on b7.\n\nAfter **1. Nc7+ Ka7 2. Rb7+**, Black has **Kb8**, then **Rb7+** is not mate \u2014 king on b8, rook on b7 \u2014 that\u2019s check, but not mate. Black can play **Kc8** or **Kc7**?\n\nWait \u2014 **Rb7+ Kb8** \u2014 then **Rb7+** is already delivered. Then Black must move \u2014 **Kc8** or **Kc7**.\n\nBut **Kc7** is attacked by knight on c7 \u2014 so illegal.\n\nSo only **Kc8**.\n\nThen **Rb8#** \u2014 yes!\n\nSo:\n\n1. Nc7+ Ka7  \n2. Rb7+ Kb8  \n3. Kc8  \n4. Rb8#\n\nBut after 2... Kb8, White can play **Rb8#** immediately? No \u2014 rook is on b7. So **Rb8#** is mate.\n\nYes! So:\n\n1. Nc7+ Ka7  \n2. Rb7+ Kb8  \n3. Rb8# \u2014 mate.\n\nWait \u2014 after 1... Ka7, 2. Rb7+ is check, 2... Kb8, then 3. Rb8# \u2014 yes, mate.\n\nBut is **Rb7** possible? The rook is on e7.\n\nSo **e7b7** \u2014 is that a legal move? The legal moves list includes: e7b7 \u2014 yes! It's in the list: `e7b7`.\n\nSo **b5c7+** is a candidate.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after **Nc7+**, what if Black doesn't play Ka7?\n\nOther king moves:\n\n- **Kb5** \u2014 after Nc7+ Kb5\n\nThen White can play **Rb7+**, forking king and rook?\n\nRb7+ Kb6 (only move, since Kb4 is not safe? Kb5 to Kb6)\n\nWait: Kb5, then Rb7+ Kc6? Or Kb6?\n\nRb7+ attacks b7, so king on b5 \u2014 Rb7+ forces:\n\n- Kb6 \u2014 then Nc7 is still there, but now king is back.\n\nBut then White can play **Na8+** or something?\n\nWait \u2014 better: after **Nc7+ Kb5**, White plays **Rb7+!**\n\nNow Black must move:\n\n- Kb6 \u2014 then **Nc7** is still attacking, but king is on b6 \u2014 attacked by knight on c7? c7 to b6 is knight move \u2014 yes, so"
