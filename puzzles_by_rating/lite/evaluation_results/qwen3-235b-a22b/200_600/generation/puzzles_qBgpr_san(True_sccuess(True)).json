When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

However, in the given FEN, the move **hxg6** is listed as the only legal move in SAN \u2014 this implies that Black *must* capture the queen.\n\nLet\u2019s verify:\n\n- White\u2019s queen on g6 is attacking the black king (check), so the move is **Qg6+**.\n- The black king on e8 is in check.\n- The only way to get out of check is to capture the queen on g6.\n- The pawn on h7 can capture en passant? No \u2014 the white queen came from, say, h5 or f5 to g6, but no double-step pawn move occurred.\n- The pawn on h7 can capture the queen on g6: **hxg6** is the only legal move.\n\nYes \u2014 **hxg6** is forced.\n\nAfter **12... hxg6**, Black is not only out of check but also has a significant material advantage (White has blundered the queen for no compensation). Black has a solid position with good development potential.\n\nNow, since the only legal move is **hxg6**, I must play it.\n\n```\nhxg6\n```"
