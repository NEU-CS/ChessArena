When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

The only legal move listed in SAN notation is `Bxd8`.\n\nLet me verify this.\n\nWhite has a rook on d8 (on the 8th rank, d-file), and Black has a bishop on f6, which can capture on d8 if it's unprotected. The bishop on f6 is on a light square, and d8 is a dark square \u2014 so the bishop on f6 (which is a dark-squared bishop, since it's on f6 and moving diagonally to d8) can indeed go to d8.\n\nNow, is the rook on d8 protected?\n\n- The rook is on d8.\n- White has a rook on d1, but that's not protecting d8 directly.\n- No other white piece is defending d8.\n- The white king is on g1 \u2014 far away.\n- The bishop on f4 is on a diagonal, but not covering d8.\n- The pawn on c3 and c2 \u2014 no help.\n\nSo, d8 is **unprotected**.\n\nTherefore, `Bxd8` is a legal and winning move \u2014 Black captures a white rook for free.\n\nMoreover, after `Bxd8`, White has no checks or immediate threats, and Black is simply up a full rook.\n\nThis is clearly the best and only legal move.\n\n```\nBxd8\n```"
