When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Legal moves are Kf8 and Bxf6.\n\nLet me examine the position:\n- White has just played 11. Qh5, attacking the knight on f6 and threatening checkmate on h7.\n- Black's knight on f6 is under attack by the queen.\n- If Black plays Kf8, then Qxh6 would be mate, since the h7 pawn is pinned and can't capture.\n- The only legal move that prevents immediate checkmate is Bxf6, capturing the knight that was being attacked.\n\nAfter Bxf6:\n- This removes the attacked piece and blocks the queen's attack on h7.\n- White's queen on h5 is now somewhat exposed.\n- Black develops a piece (the bishop) and eliminates the threat of Qxh7#.\n\nKf8 leads to immediate checkmate: 11...Kf8?? 12. Qxh6+ Ke8 13. Qg7 and it's game over.\n\nTherefore, the only move that continues the game is Bxf6.\n\n```\nBxf6\n```"
