When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

It can potentially promote if supported.\n- Black's king is on f7, somewhat exposed.\n- Black has a knight on e7, which is somewhat passive.\n- The bishop on c6 is active, but not immediately threatening.\n- Black has a rook on b3, deeply infiltrated into White's position, attacking the c3 square and potentially threatening back-rank issues.\n- White's king is on g1, relatively safe.\n- White has a rook on c1, which is currently under pressure from the b3 rook.\n\n### Immediate Threats:\n- Black's rook on b3 is attacking the c3 square and could potentially threaten the c1 rook if not careful.\n- However, White has a strong candidate: **a7a8**, promoting the rook to a8 with check.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate **a7a8**:\n\n- **a7a8=R+** (promotion with check): This moves the rook to a8, giving check to the black king on f7 via the a-file.\n- After **a7a8=R+**, Black must respond to the check.\n  - King moves: Kf6, Kf8, or Ke7.\n  - But note: after Ra8+, Black cannot interpose.\n  - Suppose: **Ra8+ Kf6**, then White can follow up with **Rc6**, attacking the bishop and threatening mate on f8.\n  - Or **Ra8+ Ke7**, then **Rxc6**, winning the bishop with material gain.\n  - Or **Ra8+ Kf8**, then **Rf1+** or **Rc8**, increasing pressure.\n\nThis is a **very strong move**: it gains tempo with check, threatens material, and increases pressure.\n\nNow, compare with other candidate moves:\n\n- **a7e7**: captures knight, but allows **Bxe7**, and then Black's rook on b3 may take on c1? Let's see:\n  - a7xe7? Bxe7, then b3xc1, Rxc1 \u2014 Black wins a rook for bishop and knight? No: White gave rook for knight, then lost another rook. That\u2019s losing material.\n  - So **a7e7?** is bad: **Bxe7** wins a tempo and defends.\n\n- **a7d7**: attacks e7, but again, **Bd7** or **Nf5** can defend. No immediate gain.\n\n- **c1c6**: captures bishop? **c1c6?** \u2014 but then **b3xc6**, and White loses a rook for a bishop, while Black has active pieces. Not good.\n\n- **c1c3**: attacking b3? **c1c3** attacks the rook on b3.\n  - Then **Rb3-b1+**, skewering the king? **Kg1**, then **Rb1+**, and if **Rc1**, then **Rxc1+ Kxc1** \u2014 but White just traded rooks, and a7 is still hanging? No, but after **Rb1+**, White must play **Rc1**, then **Rxc1+ Kxc1**, and now **Ra8+** is still possible? But Black may have time to consolidate.\n\nBut **a7a8** is faster and more forcing.\n\n### Key Point:\n**a7a8** is a **check**, so it gains tempo. It also threatens the back rank and opens up tactical possibilities.\n\nAfter **Ra8+**, Black cannot avoid material loss:\n- If **Kf6**, then **Rc6!** attacks bishop and threatens Rf8#. Black must deal with mate threat.\n- If **Kf8**, **Rf1+** Ke7, **Rxc6**, winning bishop.\n- If **Ke7**, **Rxc6**, winning bishop outright.\n\nSo **a7a8** wins at least a piece.\n\nNo other move gives such a strong, forcing advantage.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best move is **a7a8**, promoting the rook with check, leading to decisive material gain or mating attack.\n\n```\na7a8\n```"
