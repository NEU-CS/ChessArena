That suggests the queen on c3 is pinned or restricted.\n\nLet\u2019s see why only two moves are legal.\n\nQueen on c3:\n- Can it go to e1? Yes \u2014 Qc3xe1. Is that safe?\n- Can it go to c1? Yes \u2014 Qc1.\n\nWhy can't the queen go elsewhere?\n\nPossibility: **Black queen on e1 is attacking c3?** No \u2014 e1 to c3 is diagonal, but e1-c3 is light-squared. Queen on e1 is on e1 (light), c3 is dark \u2014 not same color. So no.\n\nWait \u2014 is the queen on c3 pinned?\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **black queen on e1** \u2014 it\u2019s on e1, which is same diagonal as a5-e1? a5-e1 is dark squares. e1 is light? No:\n\n- e1 is a **dark** square (a1 is dark, so e1 is dark).\n- c3 is also dark (a1 dark, c3 same diagonal? a1-c3 is light? Wait, better to calculate:\n\nStandard board:\n- a1 = dark\n- b1 = light\n- c1 = dark\n- d1 = light\n- e1 = dark\n- f1 = light\n- g1 = dark\n- h1 = light\n\nSo e1 is **dark**, c3 is:\n- c1 = dark, c2 = light, c3 = dark \u2192 yes, c3 is dark.\n\nSo e1 and c3 are both dark \u2014 so **same diagonal**? e1 to c3 is two squares left and two up \u2014 that\u2019s a diagonal of two squares southwest \u2014 yes, **along the a5-e1 diagonal extended to c3**.\n\nSo the **black queen on e1 is attacking c3** \u2014 yes, along the diagonal.\n\nTherefore, **White\u2019s queen on c3 is under attack by the black queen on e1**.\n\nSo White must either:\n- Capture the queen: **Qxe1**\n- Block the attack\n- Move the queen\n\nBut the only legal moves are **Qxe1** and **Qc1** \u2014 so apparently, **blocking is not possible**, and **only c1 is a safe retreat**? Why only c1?\n\nBecause if the queen moves, it must not leave the king exposed to check.\n\nWait \u2014 **Ka1** \u2014 if the queen moves from c3, is the king exposed?\n\nCurrently, is the king on a1 under attack?\n\n- Black queen on e1 \u2014 can it attack a1? e1 to a1 is horizontal? No \u2014 same rank? No, both on rank 1.\n\na1 and e1 are on the same rank \u2014 **rank 1**.\n\nSo **Black queen on e1 is attacking along the first rank** \u2014 a1 is on the same rank.\n\nTherefore, **the black queen on e1 is attacking the white king on a1** \u2014 but there is a **white queen on c3** blocking the path.\n\nSo the **white queen on c3 is shielding the king from the black queen on e1**.\n\nTherefore, **the queen on c3 is pinned** \u2014 it cannot move unless it captures the black queen.\n\nBecause if it moves to any square other than e1, it would expose the king to check \u2014 illegal.\n\nSo the only legal moves for the queen are:\n- **Capture the black queen**: Qxe1\n- Or move to a square that still blocks the check \u2014 but only if it remains on the a1-e1 line.\n\nBut the only squares between a1 and e1 are b1, c1, d1.\n\nQueen is on c3 \u2014 to get to b1 or d1, it would have to move \u2014 but c3 to c1 is vertical.\n\nc3 to c1 is down the c-file \u2014 that would **not** be on the a1-e1 rank.\n\nWait \u2014 **c1 is on the first rank** \u2014 yes, c1 is on rank 1.\n\nBut the queen is on c3 \u2014 to go to c1, it moves down the c-file to c1.\n\nBut c1 is **on the first rank**, so if the queen moves to c1, it is now **on the first rank**, between a1 and e1 \u2014 so it would **block the check** from the black queen on e1.\n\nYes \u2014 so **Qc1** blocks the check along the first rank.\n\nSimilarly, **Qxe1** captures the attacking queen.\n\nAny other move would leave the king in check \u2014 illegal.\n\nSo only two legal moves: **Qxe1** and **Qc1**.\n\nNow, evaluate both.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate move 1: **Qxe1**\n\n- White captures the black queen.\n- After Qxe1, black must recapture \u2014 **Rxe1** (rook on e8 or e8? Re8 is on e8 \u2014 yes, can take).\n- So: **1. Qxe1 Rxe1+**\n- Now, White must deal with check.\n\nWhere can the king go?\n\nKa1 \u2014 attacked by rook on e1? e1 to a1 is along the first rank \u2014 yes.\n\nBut after **Rxe1+**, the rook is on e1, giving check.\n\nWhite king on a1 \u2014 can it move?\n\n- b1? Is b1 safe? b1 is adjacent to a1 \u2014 but is it attacked?\n\nBlack has:\n- Rook on b8 \u2014 controls b-file.\n- So b1 is attacked by Rb8.\n\nSo Kb1 is illegal \u2014 in check from b8.\n\nKing cannot move to b1.\n\nNo other squares \u2014 a1 is in corner.\n\nSo only way to escape is to **block** or **capture**.\n\nBut after Qxe1 Rxe1+, White has:\n- King on a1\n- Queen just captured, now captured back\n- Ng6\n- Pawns\n\nNo piece can block the rook check on e1.\n\nAnd no piece can capture the rook on e1 \u2014 only the king, but it can't move there.\n\nSo **Ka1 is in check from Re1**, and cannot move, cannot block, cannot capture.\n\nSo **White is checkmated**?\n\nWait: after **1. Qxe1 Rxe1#** \u2014 yes, **checkmate**.\n\nBecause:\n- Black rook on e1 gives check.\n- White king on a1 has no escape.\n- No piece to block (queen is gone, no other pieces on first rank).\n- b1 is attacked by Rb8.\n\nSo **Qxe1 leads to immediate checkmate**: 1. Qxe1 Rxe1#.\n\nTherefore, **Qxe1 is illegal?** No \u2014 the move Qxe1 does not leave the king in check *during* the move \u2014 but after the capture, it's Black's turn, and Black can deliver checkmate.\n\nBut **Qxe1 is a legal move** \u2014 it's just a losing one.\n\nBut in terms of legality, it is allowed \u2014 but it leads to forced checkmate.\n\nSo **Qxe1 loses immediately to Rxe1#**.\n\n"
