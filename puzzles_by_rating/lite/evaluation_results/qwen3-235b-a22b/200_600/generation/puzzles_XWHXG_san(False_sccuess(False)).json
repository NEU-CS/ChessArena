When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Qf8# \u2014 mate!\n      - ...Ke8? Qe6+ Kd8 Qf7 or Qf8+ \u2014 likely winning\n\nWait \u2014 let's calculate precisely:\n\n1. **Nxf7+ Kxf7**\n2. **Qf5+ Ke8** (only, since g8 is attacked by Qf5)\n   - Now Qe6+ Kd8\n   - Qf7! \u2014 threatening Qd7# or Qf8+\n   - Or better: **Qf7!**, and Black is helpless.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after **Nxf7+ Kxf7**, is **Qf5+** check?\n\nYes! Because the queen on f3 moves to f5, and the bishop on c4 now controls f7 \u2014 but more importantly, **Qf5 gives check**, and it's a **discovered attack** by the bishop? No \u2014 the bishop is on c4, f5 is on the same diagonal? c4 to f7 is diagonal, but f5 is not on that diagonal.\n\nWait \u2014 **c4 to f7 is a diagonal (light squares)**, but **f5 is on a dark square** \u2014 so **Qf5 is not aligned with c4**.\n\nSo **Qf5+ is just the queen giving check**, not a discovered check.\n\nBut still:\n\n- **1. Nxf7+ Kxf7**\n- **2. Qf5+ Ke8**\n  - Now Qe6+ Kd8\n  - Qf7! \u2014 threatening Qd7#\n  - Black has no good defense.\n\nBut is there a better second move?\n\nAfter **2...Ke8**, **Qe6+** is check, and wins the queen or mates.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **after 1. Nxf7+ Kxf7**, can we play **Qf7#** immediately?\n\nNo \u2014 because the queen is on f3, and f7 is occupied by the knight \u2014 but we just captured on f7 with the knight, so after **Nxf7+ Kxf7**, the knight is gone, f7 is empty.\n\nSo **Qf7#** is possible?\n\nQueen from f3 to f7 \u2014 is that check?\n\nYes \u2014 and is it mate?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- After **1. Nxf7+ Kxf7**\n- **2. Qf7#** \u2014 is this legal?\n\nQueen moves from f3 to f7 \u2014 yes, same file.\n\nIs it check? Yes \u2014 attacking king on f7.\n\nCan the king move? f7 is attacked by queen.\n\n- Ke8? No \u2014 not from f7.\n- Kg8? Yes \u2014 that\u2019s a legal square.\n- But is g8 attacked?\n\nCurrently, no piece attacks g8.\n\nSo **2. Qf7+** (not #), because **Kg8** is possible.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Nxf7+ Kxf7\n2. Qf7+ Kg8\n3. Qg6+ \u2014 and now Black is in huge trouble \u2014 Qg6 threatens Qh7# or Qf7.\n\nBut Black can play ...Kh8, and maybe survive with ...Qf6 or ...Ne5.\n\nStill, White is winning.\n\nBut is there a **better** move?\n\nWait \u2014 what about **c4g8**?\n\n#### 2. **c4g8** \u2014 Bxg8\n- Takes the rook?\n- But after Rxg8, we have no immediate follow-up.\n- Not good \u2014 just trades bishop for rook, and Black is fine.\n\n#### 3. **c4f7** \u2014 Bxf7+\n- Bxf7+ Kxf7\n- Then Qf5+ Ke8\n- Qe6+ Kd8\n- Qf7! \u2014 same idea as before, but we used the bishop instead of knight.\n\nBut **Nxf7+** is better because the knight is useless on h8 \u2014 we gain activity.\n\n#### 4. **f3f6** \u2014 Qf6\n- Attacks f6 knight, but ...Qxf6, and we lose momentum.\n- Not good.\n\n#### 5. **f3c6** \u2014 Qxc6\n- Takes knight, but after bxc6, we\u2019ve traded queens, and Black has a strong center.\n- Not good \u2014 simplifies when we have an attack.\n\n#### 6. **f3h5** \u2014 Qh5\n- Threatens mate on h7? But h7 is defended.\n- Also, Qh5 attacks h4 bishop \u2014 but ...g6 or ...Bf6, and we lose initiative.\n- Not as strong.\n\n#### 7. **f3g4** \u2014 Qg4\n- Attacks h4 bishop \u2014 but ...Bf6 or ...Bf2, and we don\u2019t gain much.\n- Not forcing.\n\n#### 8. **f3d5** \u2014 Qd5\n- Central, but not clearly better.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **discovered attack ideas**?\n\nThe **bishop on c4** and **queen on f3** both target f7.\n\nBut f7 is defended by the queen on e7.\n\nSo if we can **attack the queen**, or **pin it**, or **deflect it**, we can win.\n\nBut **Nxf7+** forces the king to take, and then we have a strong attack.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back to **Nxf7+**.\n\nAfter:\n\n1. Nxf7+ Kxf7\n2. Qf5+ Ke8\n3. Qe6+ Kd8\n4. Qf7! \u2014 and now:\n\n- Threatens Qd7#\n- Also, if ...Ne5, Qf8+ Kd7, Qd6# or something.\n\nBut is there a **mate in fewer moves**?\n\nWait \u2014 what if after **Nxf7+ Kxf7**, we play **Qf7+**?\n\nAs before:\n\n2. Qf7+ Kg8\n3. Qg6+ Kh8\n4. Qh6+ Kg8\n5. Qg5+ \u2014 perpetual? Not mate.\n\nBut we can play **Qh5** instead?\n\nNo \u2014 better: after 2. Qf7+ Kg8, play **Qg6+** and if ...Kh8, then **Qh6+ Kg8**, **Qh7+ Kf8**, **Qh8#** \u2014 no, not possible.\n\nWait \u2014 after **Qg6+ Kh8**, **Qh6+ Kg8**, **Qh7+ Kf8**, **Qh8#** \u2014 yes, that\u2019s mate.\n\nBut only if we can force it.\n\nBut after **Qg6+**, Black can play ...Qg5! \u2014 blocking.\n\nFor example:\n\n1.
