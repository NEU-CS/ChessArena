When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

(not visible), Bishops on c8 and b8, pawns on a6, f7, g7, h7, e6\n\nWait \u2014 the FEN shows:\n- Black has two dark-squared bishops (c8 and b8), which is unusual but possible via promotion.\n- No Black queen or rook visible \u2014 likely captured.\n- Black king is on g8, relatively safe for now, but exposed to potential back-rank threats.\n\nWhite has a **passed e5-pawn**, and **c5 and e5 pawns** are advanced. The **White bishop on c3** is active, and the **rook on b1** is somewhat passive but can become active on the c-file or via doubling.\n\nThe **Black rook on d5** is a key piece \u2014 it's **attacking the c5 pawn** and **occupying the 5th rank**.\n\nWhite's **rook on b1** is on an open file, but not yet active.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features:**\n\n- **White to move.**\n- **c5 is under attack by Black's rook on d5.**\n- White must either **defend c5** or **counterattack**.\n- **c5-c6** is a possible push \u2014 it attacks d7 and threatens to promote, but c6 is defended by Black's bishop on b8.\n  - c5-c6: c6 is attacked by b8, so if we play c5-c6, Black can take: b8xc6.\n  - But after c5-c6 b8xc6, then White has a strong passed pawn on c6, but it's not immediately decisive.\n- Alternatively, **White can play Rb1-b5**, attacking the rook on d5, but that's not in the legal moves list \u2014 wait, check legal moves.\n\nWait \u2014 legal moves include:\n- **c5c6** \u2014 yes, pawn push\n- Rook moves: b1b8, b1b7, ..., b1a1, etc. \u2014 all horizontal/vertical rook moves\n- Bishop moves: c3 to a5, d4, b4, d2, b2, e1, a1\n- King moves: g1h1, g1f1\n- Pawn moves: h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4\n\nSo **Rb1-b5 is not listed**, but **Rb1-b6** and **Rb1-b7** are. That suggests the b-file is open \u2014 no piece blocking.\n\nBut **Rb1-b5** would be possible only if b5 is empty \u2014 but in FEN, b5 is empty (5th rank: 2PrP3 \u2192 files: a=2, b=P, c=r, d=P, ... wait no:\n\nLet me decode the 5th rank: `2PrP3`\n\nThat means:\n- a5: empty\n- b5: empty\n- c5: P (White pawn)\n- d5: r (Black rook)\n- e5: P (White pawn)\n- f5: empty\n- g5: empty\n- h5: empty\n\nSo b5 is **empty**, so **Rb1-b5 should be legal**, but it's not in the list. Wait \u2014 the legal moves include **b1b6, b1b7, b1b8**, but **not b1b5**.\n\nThat suggests that **b5 is not accessible** \u2014 perhaps due to a pin or obstruction? But visually, the b-file is open from b1 to b8.\n\nWait \u2014 unless the rook is **pinned**? But no \u2014 the only pieces on b-file are rook on b1 and nothing else \u2014 so it should be able to go to b5.\n\nBut the legal moves list does **not** include b1b5 \u2014 so perhaps the engine or move generator has filtered it for some reason? Or maybe I misread.\n\nWait \u2014 the legal moves are:\n\n`c3a5, c3d4, c3b4, c3d2, c3b2, c3e1, c3a1, g1h1, g1f1, b1b8, b1b7, b1b6, b1b5, b1b4, b1b3, b1b2, b1f1, b1e1, b1d1, b1c1, b1a1, c5c6, h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, h2h4, g2g4, f2f4`\n\nWait \u2014 **b1b5 is in the list!** Yes: `b1b5` is there.\n\nI missed it earlier.\n\nSo **Rb1-b5 is legal**.\n\nThat\u2019s important.\n\n---\n\n### **Candidate Moves**\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate key options.\n\n#### 1. **c5c6** \u2014 pawn push\n- Attacks d7, threatens to promote.\n- But **b8xc6** captures it.\n- After **c5c6 b8xc6**, White has:\n  - Rook on b1, bishop on c3, king on g1\n  - Black has bishop on c6, rook on d5\n  - e5 pawn still there\n- Now, is c6 a threat? Not really \u2014 Black can defend.\n- Also, after c5c6, Black can play **rxc5**, but no \u2014 if c5c6, then d5xc5? No, because c6 is occupied.\n- So Black must take with bishop: b8xc6.\n- Then White can play **Bc3xg7?** No \u2014 g7 is defended by h7.\n- Or **Rb1-b6**, attacking c6.\n- But Black can play **Rd5-d8** or **Rd5-e5**, defending.\n- Not immediately winning.\n\nBut **c5c6** loses a pawn for no clear gain \u2014 unless it opens something.\n\nWait \u2014 after **c5c6 b8xc6**, then **Rb1-b6** attacks c6, and if Black doesn\u2019t defend, we win the bishop.\nBut Black plays **Rd5-d7** or **Rd5-e5**, and it\u2019s equal.\n\nSo **c5c6** seems **premature**.\n\n#### 2. **Rb1-b5** \u2014 attacking the rook on d5\n- Rb1-b5 attacks the rook on d5.\n- Black must move the rook or lose it.\n- If **Rd5-d7**, then we can play **c5c6!**, now with tempo \u2014 attacking d7.\n  - If **b8xc6**, then **Rb5xd5** wins the rook.\n  - If **Rd7-d8**, then **c6xb7**? b7 is empty \u2014 no.\n  - After c6, Black\u2019s bishop must take, then Rb5 takes rook.\n- So sequence:\n  - 1. Rb1-b5 Rd5-e5 (only way to save rook?)\n  - But Re5 still attacked? No \u2014 b5 attacks d5, not e5.\n  - Wait \u2014 rook on b5 attacks along the 5th rank \u2014 so **b5 attacks c5, d5, e5, f5, g5, h5**.\n\nYes! **Rook on b5 controls the entire 5th rank**.\n\nSo if we play **Rb1-b5**, it **attacks the rook on d5**.\n\nBlack must move the rook off the 5th rank.\n\nOptions:\n- Rd5-d6\n- Rd5-d7\n- Rd5-d8\n- Rd5-e5? But e5 is occupied by White pawn \u2014 no.\n- Rd5-c5? c5 has White pawn \u2014 no.\n- So only retreat: d6, d7, d8.\n\nSay **Rd5-d7**.\n\nThen White plays **c5c6!**, attacking b7 and d7.\n\nNow:\n- If **b8xc6**, then **Rb5xd5** \u2014 wins the rook.\n- If **Rd7-d8**, then **c6xb7**? b7 is empty \u2014 no capture.\n  - But **c6** is now a passed pawn, and bishop on b8 is pinned? No.\n  - But we can play **Rb5-b8**, attacking the bishop.\n  - After **c6**, Black must take with bishop or lose material.\n\nSo in all cases, **after Rb1-b5 and c5c6**, White wins at least a piece.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s clarify:\n\nAfter:\n1. Rb1-b5! Rd5-d7 (forced)\n2. c5c6! b8xc6\n3. Rb5xd5 \u2014"
