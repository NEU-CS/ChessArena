When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The legal moves are:\n- `f8g8` (Kf8-g8)\n- `f8e8` (Kf8-e8)\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position carefully.\n\n### Material:\n- Black has two rooks, a bishop, and pawns.\n- White has a queen, a pawn on d6, f6, b2, and h2, and king on g2.\n- Black\u2019s pawns: b6, f7, g6; White\u2019s pawns: b2, d6, f6, h2.\n- White\u2019s queen is extremely active, on h5 (h6 in FEN: h5? Wait \u2014 FEN says h6: `h6` is the queen square).\n\nWait: FEN is: `5k2/pr1r1p2/1p1PbPpQ/8/8/8/1P4PK/8`\n\nSo White queen is on h6.\n\n### Key features:\n- White has a passed pawn on d6 and f6, both very advanced.\n- Black king is on f8, under pressure.\n- White queen on h6 is attacking along the 6th rank and potentially threatening mate ideas on h8 or g7.\n- Black has rooks on a7 and d7, bishop on e6.\n- Black\u2019s king is very exposed.\n\nWhite\u2019s last move must have been Qh6+, giving check.\n\nIndeed, the position before this move must have been with Black king on f8, and White played Qh6+.\n\nNow Black must move the king.\n\n### Candidate moves:\n1. `f8g8` \u2014 Kg8\n2. `f8e8` \u2014 Ke8\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate both.\n\n---\n\n### 1. `f8g8` (Kg8)\n\nKing moves to g8.\n\nNow the king is on g8, still exposed.\n\nWhite can play Qh7+ or Qg7+?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAfter `f8g8`, White plays:\n\n**Qg7+!**\n\n- Kg8-h8? (only move)\n- Then Qh7#? No \u2014 Qh7 would be mate if rook isn't on d7.\n\nWait: after `f8g8`, then Qg7+:\n\n- Kg8-h8\n- Qh7+! Kg8\n- But then Qg7+ again? No, it's a draw by repetition?\n\nWait, better: after `f8g8`, Qg7+ Kh8\n\nNow White has **Qh7#**? No \u2014 because h7 is attacked by Black\u2019s rook on d7? No \u2014 d7 rook is on d7, not controlling h7.\n\nh7 is on the 7th rank, same as rook \u2014 but rook on d7 controls h7 only if it's on the same rank.\n\nYes! The rook on d7 is on the 7th rank, so it controls h7.\n\nSo after:\n\n1. ... Kg8\n2. Qg7+ Kh8\n3. Qh7+?? \u2014 not possible, because Qh7 is attacked by Rd7.\n\nSo Qh7 is not mate.\n\nBut White can play Qf8+?\n\nWait \u2014 after ...Kg8, what is White\u2019s follow-up?\n\nQg7+ Kh8\n\nNow:\n\n- Qf8+? Rxf8 \u2014 but that\u2019s stalemate! Because Black has no legal moves.\n\nAfter Qf8+ Rxf8, the position is:\n\n- King on h8, no other pieces can move \u2014 rook on a7, but a7 is blocked? a7 rook can move, actually.\n\nWait: after Qf8+ Rxf8, we have:\n\n- Black king on h8\n- Black rook on a7, d7 is gone (captured on f8), so rook on a7 is still there.\n- So after Rxf8, Black has rook on a7 \u2014 so not stalemate.\n\nSo Qf8+ Rxf8 \u2014 then White plays d7, promoting? d6-d7, then d8=Q.\n\nBut after Qf8+ Rxf8, d7 is still possible.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back.\n\nAfter `f8g8`, Qg7+ Kh8\n\nNow White can play **d7!**, advancing the pawn.\n\nd6-d7, threatening d8=Q.\n\nNow Black must respond.\n\n- If Rdxd7, Qe8+ and mate soon.\n- If Rxd7, Qe8+ Rg8 Qf8# or similar.\n\nThis seems very dangerous.\n\nAlternatively, White can play Qf8+ immediately after Kg8?\n\nAfter `f8g8`, Qf8+:\n\n- Rxf8?? \u2014 not possible, because king is in check \u2014 must deal with check.\n\nQf8+ is check.\n\nSo after `f8g8`, Qf8+:\n\n- Kxf8?? \u2014 illegal, because Qf8+ attacks f8.\n\nKing is on g8, so:\n\nQf8+ means king must move.\n\nKing on g8, attacked by queen on f8 \u2014 so king can go to h8 or f8? f8 is occupied by queen.\n\nSo only **Kh8**.\n\nSo:\n\n1. ... Kg8\n2. Qf8+ Kh8\n\nNow White plays d7!\n\nd6-d7, threatening d8=Q.\n\nBlack must stop promotion.\n\n- Rxd7? Then Qg7# \u2014 because g7 is now covered, and king on h8 has no escape.\n\nYes: Rxd7?? Qg7#.\n\nSo Black cannot take.\n\nOther moves?\n\n- Rd8? To block d8.\n\nAfter Qf8+ Kh8, d7:\n\nBlack plays Rd8\n\nThen Qg7+ Kg8, Qg5+ or something \u2014 but White can play dxe8=Q+ or just Qg7+.\n\nWait: after Rd8, White plays Qg7+ Kg8, then Qg5+ Kf8, but then dxe8=Q+ wins.\n\nBut simpler: after d7, if Rd8, then Qg7+ Kh8, and now Qh6+ Kg8, Qg5+ Kh8, and eventually Qg7# or promote.\n\nBut actually, after d7 and Rd8, White can just play Qg7+ and force the king back, then promote.\n\nSo `f8g8` leads to a forced loss.\n\n---\n\n### 2. `f8e8` (Ke8)\n\nKing retreats to e8.\n\nNow king is on e8.\n\nWhite\u2019s queen on h6.\n\nCan White play Qh8+? No \u2014 h8 is empty, but Qh8+ would be from h6 to h8? No, h6 to h8 is not a legal queen move \u2014 it's two squares up.\n\nQueen can go from h6 to h8 only if it's vertical, yes \u2014 h6 to h8 is two squares up, so yes, queen can go h6-h8.\n\nBut h8 is empty? Yes.\n\nBut after `f8e8`, the king is on e8, so Qh8+ is possible?\n\nQh6-h8+ \u2014 yes, that\u2019s a legal move.\n\nSo:\n\nAfter `f8e8`, White plays Qh8+!\n\n- Ke8-d7? (only move, assuming no block)\n\nKd7.\n\nNow White has d7 coming: d6-d7, attacking the rook on d7.\n\nRd7 is pinned? Not yet.\n\nAfter Kd7, d7 forks the rook \u2014 d7 attacks d8, so if rook is on d7, d7 move attacks the square, but not the rook.\n\nd6-d7 attacks c8 and e8, but not d7.\n\nBut d7 pawn on d7 would attack c8 and e8.\n\nBut the rook on d7 is on d7 \u2014 so if d6-d7, the pawn captures nothing \u2014 it just advances.\n\nBut now the pawn is on d7, attacking e8 and c8.\n\nBlack must deal with the threat of d8=Q.\n\nSo Black must play ...Rxd7.\n\nThen White plays Qc8+! \u2014 check.\n\n- Kd7-e6? (only escape)\n\nThen Qc6+ Ke5, Qc5+ Ke4, and the queen mops up.\n\nBut also, after Rxd7, Qc8+ Ke7, Qc7+ Ke8, Qb8+ etc., but Black has bishop on e6.\n\nWait: bishop on e6 \u2014 after Qc8+ Ke7, Qc7+ Ke8, Qb8+ Kd7, but then Qb7+ wins the rook or something.\n\nBut more importantly, after `f8e8`, Qh8+ Kd7, d7 Rxd7, Qc8+ Ke7, Qc7+ Ke8, Qb8+ Kd7, Qb7+ Kd8, Qxa7 \u2014 winning a rook.\n\nAnd White is up material and has strong attack.\n\nBut is there a better defense?\n\nAlternatively, after `f8e8`, Qh8+ Kd7, instead of d7, White can play Qg7, threatening mate on g7 or f8.\n\nBut d7 is"
