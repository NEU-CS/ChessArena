If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully.\n\nFEN: `8/8/6K1/7P/6P1/1p6/3k4/8 w - - 0 55`\n\nWhite to move.\n\n### Material:\n- White: King on g6, pawns on h5 and g4\n- Black: King on d2, pawn on b3\n\nWhite has two pawns, one on g4 and one on h5. The black pawn on b3 is far advanced but currently not an immediate threat \u2014 it's on the 3rd rank, and the black king is far away on d2. White's king is on g6, close to promoting the h-pawn.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- The white king is near the h5 pawn, and with correct play, can support its promotion.\n- The black king is on d2 \u2014 very far from the action. It cannot interfere with white's pawns in time unless White blunders.\n- The black pawn on b3 is a potential threat, but it would take many moves to promote, and White is likely to promote first.\n- White's immediate goal should be to push the h-pawn with king support.\n\n### Candidate moves:\nLet\u2019s evaluate each legal move:\n\n1. **g6h7** \u2013 King to h7: moves away from the center and from supporting the g4 pawn. But it's heading toward the h5 pawn. However, h7 is a bit passive.\n2. **g6g7** \u2013 King to g7: supports h5 pawn, prepares to push h5h6 and then h6h7, etc. This is a strong centralizing move for the king in the promotion race.\n3. **g6f7** \u2013 King to f7: retreats, away from both pawns. Not ideal.\n4. **g6h6** \u2013 King to h6: supports h5 pawn directly, prepares h5h6 push. Also keeps king in front of pawn.\n5. **g6f6** \u2013 King to f6: moves toward center, but not clearly useful. Doesn't support h-pawn as well.\n6. **g6g5** \u2013 King to g5: advances toward the center, but may not be optimal. Could be useful to support h-pawn later, but slower.\n7. **g6f5** \u2013 King to f5: too far from h-pawn, allows potential counterplay? Not good.\n8. **h5h6** \u2013 Pushing the h-pawn to h6: this is a critical move. It advances the pawn one step closer to promotion. But is it safe?\n   - After h5h6, Black plays ...b3b2, then b2b1=Q, and if White doesn't promote soon, it could be a race.\n   - But after h5h6, White can follow up with h6h7 and h7h8=Q, unless the king is in the way.\n   - However, after h5h6, the white king is still on g6, and can go to h7 next move.\n   - But let's see: after **h5h6**, Black plays **b3b2**, then White plays **h6h7**, Black **b2b1=Q**, White **h7h8=Q** \u2014 then White has a queen, but Black also has one. However, White's king is closer and may win.\n   - But is there a faster way?\n\nWait \u2014 can White force a quicker promotion?\n\nLet\u2019s consider **g6g7**.\n\nAfter **g6g7**, the king is on g7, supporting h5. Then next move, **h5h6** is possible, and then h6h7, h7h8=Q.\n\nBut **h5h6** now is also possible.\n\nBut let's see: is **h5h6** winning?\n\nAfter **h5h6**, Black plays **b3b2**, then **h6h7**, **b2b1=Q**, **h7h8=Q** \u2014 race ends in queens.\n\nBut then White has a queen and king on h8, Black has queen on b1 and king on d2.\n\nWhite can then play Qh8-d4+ or something, but it's messy.\n\nBut can White **prevent** the black pawn from promoting?\n\nNo \u2014 because the black king is not needed to promote the b-pawn \u2014 it will queen on b1 regardless, and the white king is too far.\n\nSo **both sides will promote**, unless White can checkmate or win the queen.\n\nBut the key is: **who promotes first?**\n\nLet\u2019s compare:\n\n### Option 1: Play **h5h6** now\n- 55. h5h6 b3b2\n- 56. h6h7 b2b1=Q\n- 57. h7h8=Q\n\nWhite promotes on move 57.\n\nBlack promotes on move 56 \u2014 **one move earlier**.\n\nSo Black gets the queen first \u2014 dangerous.\n\nAfter 57...Qb1, White is promoting, but Black can start checking: Qb1-g6+, etc.\n\nBut White\u2019s king is on g6 \u2014 after 55. h5h6, king is still on g6.\n\nAfter 55...b2, 56. h7, b1=Q+, then **Qb1-g6+**, checking the white king!\n\nOh! That\u2019s critical.\n\nAfter:\n- 55. h5h6 b3b2\n- 56. h6h7 b2b1=Q+\n- 57. Kg6-g5? Or Kg6-f5? But then Qb1-h7+ or something.\n\nActually, **56...b1=Q+** gives check!\n\nBecause the white king is on g6, and a queen on b1 gives diagonal check via b1-h7-g6? No \u2014 b1 to g6 is not a diagonal.\n\nb1 is a dark square, g6 is light square \u2014 no diagonal.\n\nb1 is a1-h8 diagonal? b1 is on the a2-b1-c0 diagonal? No.\n\nLet\u2019s see: b1 is file b, rank 1.\n\ng6 is file g, rank 6.\n\nDifference: 5 files apart, 5 ranks \u2014 so yes, **b1 to g6 is a diagonal** \u2014 it's the b1-g6 diagonal.\n\nYes! b1-g6 is a diagonal: b1, c2, d3, e4, f5, g6.\n\nSo **if the white king is on g6**, and a black queen appears on b1, it gives **check**!\n\nSo:\n\n- 55. h5h6 b3b2\n- 56. h6h7 b2b1=Q+! (check)\n- Now White must move the king: Kg6-f5, or Kg6-f6, or Kg6-h5?\n\nBut after that, Black has a checking queen, and White is still one move away from promoting: h7h8=Q.\n\nSo after 57. Kf5 (say), then 57...Qb1-h7+ (or Qb1-h1+), and then White plays h7h8=Q.\n\nBut now Black has a check first, and can harass the white king.\n\nMoreover, after promotion, White has a queen, but Black\u2019s queen is already active.\n\nThis could lead to a draw or even loss if White isn't careful.\n\nSo **h5h6** allows **check upon promotion**, which is bad.\n\nCan we avoid that?\n\nYes \u2014 by **bringing the king to h7 first**, so that after h7h8=Q, there is no check.\n\nSo better plan: **King moves to h7**, then h5h6, h6h7, h7h8=Q \u2014 and when Black queens, it won\u2019t be check.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n- 55. Kg6-h7! (this is g6h7)\n- Now Black plays 55...b3b2\n- 56. h5h6 b2b1=Q\n- 57. h6h7 Qb1-h7+\n- 58. Kxh7 \u2014 but wait, king is on h7, so 57...Qb1-h7+ is check, and king must move.\n\nOh! If king is on h7, and black queens on b1, then Qb1-h7+ is still check!\n\nBecause b1-h7 is the same diagonal: b1, c2, d3, e4, f5, g6, h7 \u2014 yes, h7 is on the b1-h7 diagonal.\n\nSo **any time the white king is on g6, f5, e4, d3, c2, or h7**, a queen on b1 gives check.\n\nThe only safe squares for the king are off that diagonal.\n\nBut during the race, the king needs to be near the h-pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 is there any way to avoid the check?\n\nOnly if the king is not on the b1-h7 diagonal.\n\nBut to support h7h8=Q, the king often ends up on g7 or h7.\n\nLet\u2019s try **g6g7**:\n\n- 55. Kg6-g7\n- Black: b3b2\n- 56. h5h6 b2b1=Q\n- Now, is Qb1-g7+? b1 to"
