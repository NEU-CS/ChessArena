When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Rxf6**, Black is completely lost.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **Qxf6+** legal? Yes, it's in the legal moves list.\n\nBut let's check if **gxf6** is forced \u2014 yes, king is in check.\n\nBut after **Qxf6+ gxf6**, the white queen is gone, but we have **Qh6+**? No \u2014 the queen already captured on f6 and was recaptured. So **Qh6+** is not possible \u2014 the queen is off the board.\n\nWait! **Mistake in analysis**.\n\n**Qxf6+** means: **Queen takes on f6 with check**.\n\nAfter **gxf6**, the queen is captured. So we don\u2019t have a queen anymore. So **Qh6+** is impossible.\n\nSo that line **doesn't work**.\n\nSo **Qxf6+??** is a blunder \u2014 we lose the queen for a knight, and black gets a strong pawn structure and open king for ours.\n\nSo **Qxf6+** is bad.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is it check? Yes, because queen attacks f6 and gives check to king on g7.\n\nBut after **gxf6**, king is on g7, and f6 pawn is on f6 \u2014 is the king still in check?\n\nNo \u2014 the queen is on f6, attacking g7 \u2014 yes, it **is** check.\n\nBut after **gxf6**, the pawn captures the queen \u2014 so **no**, the queen is captured, so no check.\n\nSo **Qxf6+ gxf6** \u2014 and queen is gone.\n\nSo we lose the queen for a knight \u2014 terrible.\n\nSo **Qxf6+ is a blunder**.\n\nAvoid.\n\n---\n\n### Try: **Qxe6+**\n\n- **Qxe6+** \u2014 check.\n- Black can play **Kh8** or **f6** or **Qf7**?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n1. **Qxe6+ Kh8**\n   - Then **Qh6** \u2014 threatening mate on g7.\n   - Black must defend: **Qf7**, **Rf7**, **Rg8**, etc.\n   - But **Qh6 Qf7** \u2014 then **Rxf7! Kxf7**, **Qh7+ Ke6**, messy.\n   - Not clearly winning.\n\nAlternatively, **Qxe6+ f6** \u2014 blocking with pawn.\n- Then **Qe4**, attacking b7 and threatening mate ideas.\n\nBut Black can play **Qc7**, defending.\n\nNot decisive.\n\n---\n\n### Try: **Qf5** or **Qg5** \u2014 attacking g6 and threatening mate on h7?\n\n- **Qg5** \u2014 threatens **Qxg6+ hxg6**, but then **Ne4** or **Rf7**, not clear.\n\nBut **Qg5** is met by **Qc7**, defending h7 and eyeing g3.\n\nNot strong.\n\n---\n\n### Try: **Nd5!**\n\nKnight to d5 \u2014 attacking f6 and e6, also supporting e7 ideas.\n\nBut after **Nd5**, Black plays **Qc6**, defending e6 and b5.\n\nNot forcing.\n\n---\n\n### Try: **Qd6!**\n\nQueen to d6 \u2014 attacking e6 and b6, pinning the queen?\n\nWait \u2014 Black\u2019s queen is on b7, so **Qd6** attacks b6 square, threatens **Qxb6**.\n\nIs **Qd6** safe?\n\n- Can Black take on c3? No.\n- After **Qd6**, if **Qc6**, then **Qxe6+** is possible.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n1. **Qd6 Qc6**\n2. **Qxe6+ Kh8**\n3. **Qe7** \u2014 attacking rook on f8 and threatening **Qf7#** or **Qg7#**\n\nBlack must play **Rf7**, then **Qe8+ Rf8 Qe6** \u2014 still better for White, but not decisive.\n\nBut perhaps better: after **Qd6**, if **Qc6**, then **Ne4!** \u2014 threatening **Nf6+** or **Nd6**.\n\nBut not clearly winning.\n\n---\n\n### Best idea: **Qc7!**\n\nQueen to c7 \u2014 attacking the queen on b7, and also eyeing h7.\n\n1. **Qc7! Qxc7** (forced? Or can Black avoid?)\n\nWait \u2014 if **Qc7**, Black can play **Qa8**, retreating.\n\nBut then White has **Qxb7**, winning the exchange \u2014 rook for bishop or knight?\n\nNo \u2014 **Qc7** attacks b7 queen.\n\nSo:\n\n- **Qc7!** \u2014 attacks Black\u2019s queen on b7.\n- If **Qxc7**, then **Rxf6!** \u2014 again, **Rxf6** with discovered attack.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n1. **Qc7! Qxc7**\n2. **Rxf6!**\n\nNow, **Rxf6**, and the rook attacks g6 and threatens **Rg6+**.\n\nAfter **Rxf6**, Black must respond:\n\n- **Kxf6**? Then **Rf1+ Ke5**, messy, but White has **Ne4+**, etc. \u2014 winning material.\n- Or **Rxf6**? Then **Rxf6+ Kg8**, and **Rf8+** wins the queen or mates.\n\nWait:\n\nAfter **2. Rxf6**, if **Rxf6**, then **Rxf6+ Kg8**, and now **Rf8+**:\n\n- **Kg7**? **Rf7+ Kh8 Qc8#** \u2014 no queen.\n\nWait \u2014 **Qc7** was just captured.\n\nSo no queen.\n\nSo **Rf8+** \u2014 **Kg7**, **Rf7+ Kh8**, and then **Ne4** or **b3**, but no immediate mate.\n\nBut White is up a piece \u2014 knight for nothing.\n\nBecause after **Qc7 Qxc7 Rxf6**, and if **Rxf6 Rxf6**, then White has **Ne4**, winning the queen? No.\n\nLet\u2019s track material:\n\n- After **Qc7 Qxc7**: queens are off.\n- Then **Rxf6**: rook takes knight.\n- Black takes back with **Rxf6**.\n- Then **Rxf6**: rook takes rook.\n- So material: White lost a rook, gained a knight; Black lost a queen and knight, gained a rook.\n\nWait \u2014 no:\n\n- White: queen and rook sacrificed? No.\n\nSequence:\n\n1. **Qc7 Qxc7** \u2014 queens exchanged.\n2. **Rxf6** \u2014 White\u2019s rook takes knight on f6.\n   - Black can:\n     - **Kxf6** \u2014 king takes rook.\n     - **Rxf6** \u2014 rook takes rook.\n     - **gxf6** \u2014 pawn takes rook.\n\nAll are bad.\n\n"
