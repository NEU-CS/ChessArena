Black to move.\n\n### Material:\n- White: King on g5, pawn on h4\n- Black: King on b4, pawns on a6 and b5\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White king is on g5, aiming to support the h-pawn's promotion.\n- Black king is on b4, far from the action on the kingside, but has two pawns on the queenside.\n- Black's pawns are on a6 and b5 \u2014 they are not connected and somewhat weak.\n- The white king is close to the h-pawn and can support its promotion if not distracted.\n- Black must prevent h4-h5-h6-h7-h8=Q.\n\nBut wait \u2014 it's **Black to move**. Can Black do anything to stop White's h-pawn?\n\nLet\u2019s assess the **race**:\n- White's king is on g5, pawn on h4. It can push h5, h6, etc. The black king is on b4 \u2014 very far.\n- However, **White is not immediately winning** because the black king might not be able to stop the h-pawn, but **Black may have counterplay on the queenside**.\n\nBut let\u2019s check: can Black's pawns promote?\n\n- Black has pawns on a6 and b5. They are **isolated and blocked**.\n- The a6 pawn can go a5, then a4, etc., but without support, it's slow.\n- But crucially: **White has no pawns on the queenside**, so if Black can create a passed pawn and advance it, it might distract the white king.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the **key squares**.\n\n### Can Black win?\nLet\u2019s see if Black can create a passed pawn.\n\nCurrently:\n- b5 and a6 \u2014 if Black plays ...a5, then after bxa5, ...b4 could be played, creating a passed pawn.\nBut White might not even need to capture.\n\nBut more importantly: **is White winning?**\n\nWhite\u2019s plan: Kf6, Ke7, Kd8, etc., to support h5-h6-h7-h8=Q.\n\nBut Black can try to promote first on the queenside.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate:\n\nSuppose Black plays ...a5 now.\n\nAfter 1...a5, then White can play 2. h5, advancing.\n\nBut Black can play ...Kc5, then ...Kc4, ...b4, creating a passed pawn.\n\nBut let\u2019s see who promotes first.\n\nAlternatively, **Black may not have enough time** \u2014 the white h-pawn is much closer to promotion.\n\nBut here's a critical idea: **opposition and king activity**.\n\nWait \u2014 is this a **mutual zugzwang** or can Black draw?\n\nBut Black is to move \u2014 and has limited options.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **distance**:\n\n- White king to h8: g5 \u2192 h6 \u2192 h7 \u2192 h8: 3 moves if h-pawn is supported.\n- h4 to h8: needs 4 moves (h5, h6, h7, h8), but pawn moves every other turn.\n\nBut Black\u2019s king is on b4 \u2014 to reach h4 to stop the pawn, it needs: b4 \u2192 c5 \u2192 d6 \u2192 e5 \u2192 f5 \u2192 g5 \u2192 h5: 6 moves. Too far.\n\nSo **Black cannot stop the h-pawn with the king**.\n\nTherefore, **Black must create a counter-threat** \u2014 a passed pawn on the queenside that forces White to deal with it.\n\nSo Black must try to **create a passed pawn and advance it quickly**.\n\nCurrent pawns: a6, b5.\n\nIf Black plays ...a5, then after bxa5, ...b4 creates a passed pawn.\n\nBut there is no white pawn on a4 \u2014 so after ...a5, if White doesn't capture, Black can play ...a4, then ...a3, etc.\n\nBut White can just push h5 and ignore.\n\nBut let\u2019s see:\n\nBest try for Black: **...a5!**, creating a threat.\n\nAfter 1...a5, if 2. h5, then 2...Kc5! 3. h6 Kc4 4. h7 Kb3 5. h8=Q a4, and Black has a passed a-pawn.\n\nBut White queens first, and then can check the black king.\n\nBut after 5. h8=Q a4, Black has a pawn on a4, which is far from queening, and White can just take it with the queen.\n\nSo that doesn\u2019t work.\n\nAlternatively, if Black plays ...Kc5 first?\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n1...Kc5\nThen White plays 2. h5! b4 (trying to create a passer)\n3. h6 Kd6\n4. h7 Ke7\n5. h8=Q Kf7\nAnd White is winning.\n\nBut Black\u2019s pawns are still on a6 and b4 \u2014 no progress.\n\nSo Black must **start the pawn immediately**.\n\nThe key idea: **...a5!** to fix the structure and prepare ...b4.\n\nBut better: **...Kc4!**?\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\n1...Kc4! \u2014 centralizing and threatening to support ...b4.\n\nAfter 1...Kc4, White plays 2. h5.\n\nNow 2...a5! \u2014 now if 3. h6, then 3...b4! 4. h7 b3 5. h8=Q b2\n\nNow Black has a b-pawn on b2, about to queen.\n\nWhite\u2019s queen checks: 6. Qb8+ Kc3 7. Qb3+ Kd4 8. Qb4+ Ke5 9. Qc5+ Kf6 10. Qd6+ Kg5 11. Qe7+ Kxh5 12. Qf7+ Kg5 13. Qg7+ Kf5 14. Qf7+ Ke5 15. Qe7+ Kd5 16. Qd7+ Kc5 17. Qc7+ Kb5 18. Qb7+ Ka5 19. Qa7+ Kb4 20. Qb6+ Ka4 21. Qc6+ Kb4 22. Qb6+ Ka4 \u2014 draw by repetition?\n\nBut Black can play for win: after 5...b2, White must check, but Black king can march to the center.\n\nBut actually, after 5...b2, White can play 6. h8=Q b1=Q, and it's a queen endgame with mutual threats.\n\nBut Black has a queen on b1 and king on c4, White has queen on h8.\n\nThen 7. Qh4+ Kc5 8. Qg5+ Kc6 9. Qf6+ Kc7 10. Qe7+ Kc8 11. Qd6 Qb8+ 12. Kf5 Qb1+ 13. Ke6 Qb6+ 14. Kd5 Qb7+ 15. Kd4 Qb6+ 16. Kd3 Qb5+ 17. Kd2 Qb4+ 18. Kd1 Qb1+ 19. Kd2 Qb2+ 20. Kd1 Qa1+ \u2014 perpetual?\n\nBut White might avoid this.\n\nAlternatively, after 1...Kc4 2. h5 a5 3. h6 b4 4. h7 b3 5. h8=Q b2, White can play 6. Qh4+! Kd5 (6...Kc5 7. Qg5+ forces king away) 7. Qg5+ Ke6 8. Qf5+ Kd6 9. Qe5+ Kc6 10. Qc5+ Kb7 11. Qb5+ Ka7 12. Qa5+ Kb7 13. Qb5+ Ka7 \u2014 again, repetition.\n\nSo Black can **draw** with accurate play.\n\nBut can Black do better?\n\nWait \u2014 what if Black plays **...a5** first?\n\n1...a5!\n\nNow the position is:\n\n- If 2. h5, then 2...Kc5! 3. h6 Kc4 4. h7 Kb3 5. h8=Q a4\n\nNow Black has a passed a-pawn on a4.\n\nWhite queens, but Black plays ...a3, and the a-pawn is far.\n\nBut White can play 6. Qb8+ Kc3 7. Qb6! a2 8. Qc5+ Kd3 9. Qd5+ Ke3 10. Qc5+ Kf3 11. Qd5+ Kg3 12. Qe5+ Kh3 13. Qf5+ Kh4 14. Qf6+ Kh3 15. Qf3+ Kh4 16. Qf4+ Kh5 17. Qf5"

Black has two connected pawns on the queenside: a5 and b5. White has a pawn on h5 and king on g5. Black king is on b4, White king on g5.\n- **Goal**: Black aims to promote one of the pawns. White aims to stop them and possibly promote their own h-pawn.\n- **Key factors**:\n  - The Black king is already very active, deep in White's territory.\n  - The White king is racing toward the h-file to support h5's promotion.\n  - Black must use the king to support the a- and b-pawns while preventing White from queening first.\n\nCurrent move is **44...**, and it's Black's turn.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\nAvailable legal moves: `Kc5, Kc4, Ka4, Kc3, Kb3, Ka3, a4`\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each:\n\n1. **a4?** \u2013 This weakens the pawn structure. It isolates the b-pawn and removes the possibility of supporting it later. Also, it doesn\u2019t help the king advance. Premature and risky. Not best.\n\n2. **Kc5** \u2013 Centralizes the king, supports both b5 and a5, prepares to escort the b-pawn. Strong.\n\n3. **Kc4** \u2013 Similar, but more advanced. Eyes the c3 square and supports b5. But may be slightly less flexible than Kc5.\n\n4. **Ka4** \u2013 Stays on the a-file, supports a5. But king is on the edge, less flexible. Doesn't help b5.\n\n5. **Kc3** \u2013 Very far advanced, but may be too committal. After Kc3, White plays h6, and if White promotes first, Black may lose. Also, Kc3 doesn't defend a5.\n\n6. **Kb3** \u2013 Attacks a4, supports b5. But a5 is undefended after this? No \u2014 a5 is a pawn, but if White could capture it... but White has no pieces. Still, moving Kb3 leaves a5 still there, but not defended. However, no immediate capture possible. This move threatens to advance b4 and push through.\n\n7. **Ka3** \u2013 Too passive, edge of the board. Loses time.\n\n### Critical idea:\nBlack must use the king to escort the **b-pawn** or **a-pawn** to promotion, while the White king is racing to promote h5.\n\nBut note: **White is one step away from queening h5!** h5-h6-h7-h8. White plays h6 next, then h7, then h8=Q. But White just played h5 (from move history: h5), so it's White's move after this.\n\nWait \u2014 move number is **44b**, so Black is to move now.\n\nAfter Black moves, White will play **45. h6**, then Black must respond.\n\nSo timing is critical.\n\nBut Black\u2019s pawns are on a5 and b5 \u2014 two connected passed pawns. If the Black king can support their advance, they can queen faster than White\u2019s h-pawn.\n\nBest plan: **Advance the king toward the b-pawn to support b4-b3-b2-b1=Q**.\n\nThe key is **zugzwang or race**.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\nSuppose Black plays **44...Kc5**, centralizing.\n\nThen 45. h6 Kc6! 46. h7 b4! 47. h8=Q b3 \u2014 and Black queens with check or immediately promotes. But after 47...b3, White queens first, but Black promotes next move. However, with queens on board, and Black king exposed, it might be dangerous.\n\nBut actually: after 47. h8=Q b3, Black threatens b2 and queens. White cannot stop it. So it's a draw at best? Or win?\n\nBut Black can do better.\n\nWhat if Black plays **44...Kb3!**?\n\nThreat: b4, then b3, queening.\n\nAfter 44...Kb3, White plays 45. h6\n\nNow 45...Kb4! 46. h7 b4! 47. h8=Q b3\n\nAgain, both queens, but Black is promoting with tempo.\n\nBut better: **44...Kc4!**\n\nThis is very strong.\n\n44...Kc4! 45. h6 Kc3! 46. h7 b4! 47. h8=Q b3\n\nAgain, b3 with check? Kc3 to c2 or c3? b3+ is check if king is on c3.\n\nYes! If Black king is on c3, and Black plays ...b3+, it's a discovered check!\n\nWait: b-pawn on b5, moves b4, then b3. When it moves to b3, if the White king is on c1 or c2, it could be check. But in this case, White king is on g5, then h6, h7, h8 \u2014 so no.\n\nBut when Black plays ...b3, it's not check unless the White king is on c3 or c2.\n\nBut in this line, White king is far away.\n\nSo no check.\n\nBut the point is: **Black queens next move after White queens**.\n\nBut can Black **prevent White from queening**?\n\nNo \u2014 h5-h6-h7-h8 is three moves: h6, h7, h8=Q. White will queen in three moves.\n\nBlack\u2019s b-pawn: b5-b4-b3-b2-b1 = four moves. Too slow.\n\nBut with king support, maybe faster?\n\nWait: Black doesn't have to push b-pawn. Can use king to support a-pawn?\n\na5-a4-a3-a2-a1 = four moves too.\n\nBut king can help.\n\nBetter idea: **use king to block the White king from supporting h6-h7-h8**.\n\nBut White king is already on g5, and h5 is passed. The king doesn't need to support it \u2014 it's already advancing.\n\nWait \u2014 h5 is a pawn, and it's on h5, White to play after Black moves.\n\nSo after Black moves, White plays h6.\n\nThen h7, then h8=Q.\n\nThree moves.\n\nCan Black queen in three moves?\n\nFrom b5: b4 (1), b3 (2), b2 (3) \u2014 then queens on 4th. No.\n\nBut if the king helps, maybe sacrifice?\n\nNo.\n\nBut Black has **two pawns**. The key is **White cannot stop both** if the king is far.\n\nBut White king is on g5, which is far from a5/b5.\n\nIn fact, **the Black king can escort one pawn while the other distracts**.\n\nBut more importantly: **White is in zugzwang-like situation**?\n\nNo \u2014 White has the move advantage.\n\nBut let's calculate a critical line.\n\nTry **44...Kc5!**\n\nThis is central, supports both pawns, prepares Kb6 or Kc6 to support a5 or b5.\n\nAfter 45. h6 Kc6! 46. h7 b4! 47. h8=Q b3\n\nNow Black queens next move. But after 48. Qa8+ (or any check), Black plays Kb6 or Kc7, then ...b2.\n\nBut White can check repeatedly.\n\nHowever, Black can play ...b2 and queen.\n\nBut it's messy.\n\nIs there a faster way?\n\nWhat if Black plays **44...a4!**?\n\nThis fixes the a-pawn, creates a passed b-pawn.\n\nBut then White plays h6, and queens.\n\nBut now Black has b5, and king can go to b4, c4, etc.\n\nBut b5-b4-b3-b2-b1 = 4 moves.\n\nSame issue.\n\nWait \u2014 **the key is that White cannot queen safely if Black\u2019s king is active**.\n\nBut in this position, **Black can force a draw at minimum**, but can Black win?\n\nActually, **White is winning if Black doesn't act precisely**, because h-pawn queens first.\n\nBut Black has a **stalemate or counterplay**?\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 let's see distance.\n\nWhite king is on g5, but it doesn't need to move \u2014 the h-pawn advances alone.\n\nh5-h6-h7-h8=Q: 3 moves.\n\nBlack\u2019s fastest pawn promotion: say b5-b4 (1), b4-b3 (2), b3-b2 (3), b2-b1=Q (4). 4 moves.\n\nSimilarly for a-pawn.\n\nSo White queens first.\n\nBut after White queens, Black may queen next move, but White can check and perhaps force a draw or win.\n\nBut Black\u2019s king is close to the action.\n\nHowever, there is a **critical idea**: **Black can use the king to attack the White king or create a barrier**.\n\nBut more importantly: **is the position drawn?**\n\nBut the question is: what is the best move?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **44...Kc4!**\n\nThis move attacks the c3 square, and after h6, Black can play Kc3, threatening"
