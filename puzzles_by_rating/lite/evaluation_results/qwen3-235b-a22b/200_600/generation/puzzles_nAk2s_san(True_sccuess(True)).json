If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Let's verify this.\n\nWhite's king is on h1, and there is a black pawn on g2, which is attacking h1. However, there is a black rook on h2, which is also attacking h1. So the white king is currently in check from the rook on h2.\n\nTherefore, White must get out of check. The only way to do so is to capture the rook on h2 with the king, since interposing or moving away isn't possible (the king has no safe squares, and no other piece can block or capture the rook).\n\nThus, the only legal move is `Kxh2`.\n\nLet's confirm it's a legal and safe capture:\n- The king captures the rook on h2.\n- After `Kxh2`, the king is no longer in check.\n- No other pieces are attacking h2 in a way that would make the capture illegal (we must check if any piece can recapture or if the king walks into check, but after the capture, the position is stable).\n\nNow, let's consider if any other moves are possible:\n- Can any piece block the check? The rook on h2 is on an open file, and no piece can interpose.\n- Can the king move to g1? No \u2014 g1 is attacked by the rook on h2 (via h1).\n- Can the king move to h1? It's already on h1.\n- So only capture is possible.\n\nHence, the only legal and forced move is `Kxh2`.\n\n```\nKxh2\n```"
