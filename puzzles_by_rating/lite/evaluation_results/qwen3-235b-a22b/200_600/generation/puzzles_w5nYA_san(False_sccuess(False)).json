When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Black's king is on e8, but the rook is on d8 \u2014 king likely not castled.\n- **Center & Development:**\n  - White has a bishop on d4, which is active.\n  - The knight on b1 is undeveloped; same for the a1 rook.\n  - Black has a bishop on g4, pinning the knight if there were one on f3, but currently no knight there.\n  - Black's king is stuck in the center, rook on d8 \u2014 potential target.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features**\n\n- The **Bishop on d4** is attacking the g7 pawn via the diagonal. But more importantly, it's **hanging** \u2014 it's under attack by the **Black bishop on g4**, which is targeting d4.\n\nWait: **Bd4 is attacked by Bg4**. So **d4 is under attack**.\n\nIs the d4 bishop defended?\n\n- Currently, **no**. The bishop on d4 is **undefended** and attacked by Bg4.\n\nSo **White must respond to the threat to the bishop on d4**.\n\nTherefore, **White is in danger of losing the bishop** unless it moves or is defended.\n\nBut can it be defended?\n\n- Can we play **e3**? That would block the diagonal, but e3 is a possible move (f1e3 is in the legal list).\n- Or we can **move the bishop**.\n\nSo the **bishop on d4 is under attack**, so **we must either move it or defend it**.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **legal moves**:\n\n```\nd4g7, d4f6, d4e5, d4c5, d4e3, h1g1, f1a6, f1b5, f1c4, f1d3, f1e2, e1d2, b1a3, b1d2, c3c4, h2h3, g2g3, f2f3, b2b3, a2a3, h2h4, f2f4, b2b4, a2a4\n```\n\nSo **d4e3** is a legal move \u2014 that would block the pin and defend the bishop? Wait: **d4e3** means **Bd4-e3**, which moves the bishop away.\n\nBut **f1e3** is also a legal move \u2014 that would be **Bf1-e3**, which would **block the diagonal** and **defend the bishop on d4**.\n\nWait \u2014 if we play **f1e3**, then the bishop on d4 is defended, and the pin is broken.\n\nBut **Bg4 is attacking d4**, and if we play **Be3**, then **Be3 defends Bd4**, so the bishop is no longer hanging.\n\nSo **f1e3** is a candidate.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: is **d4e3** (Bd4-e3) better?\n\nAlternatively, **Bd4 can capture**:\n\n- **d4g7**: Bxg7 \u2014 captures the rook? Wait: h8 rook, but g7 is a pawn? No \u2014 g7 has a pawn (from FEN: black pawns on f7,g7,h7). So **Bg7 is occupied by a black pawn**.\n\nWait \u2014 **d4g7**: that would be **Bxg7**, capturing a **pawn on g7**, not a rook.\n\nBut after **Bxg7**, Black plays **Rxh1** \u2014 we lose the rook.\n\nLet\u2019s check:\n\n- **1. Bxg7 Rxh1**\n- We lose the rook, get a pawn \u2014 bad.\n\nSo **d4g7** loses a rook for a pawn \u2014 **inadvisable**.\n\n**d4f6**: Bxf6 \u2014 black has a knight on f6? From FEN: black pieces \u2014 knight on g8, bishop on f8, rook on h8 \u2014 so **f6 is empty**.\n\nWait \u2014 FEN: `2kr1bnr/pp3ppp/8/...` \u2014 so on f8 is a bishop, g8 knight, h8 rook. f6 is empty.\n\nSo **Bxf6** would capture nothing \u2014 just move to f6.\n\nBut is that good? It gets the bishop to f6, but it's still under attack? No \u2014 after **Bd4-f6**, the **Bg4** no longer attacks it.\n\nBut is it strong? f6 is a strong square, but we moved the bishop away from the center.\n\nBut we could consider it.\n\n**d4e5**: Be5 \u2014 central, but possibly kicked by f6.\n\n**d4c5**: Bxc5 \u2014 captures a pawn.\n\nBlack has a pawn on c5 \u2014 so **Bxc5** wins a pawn.\n\nIs it safe?\n\nAfter **Bxc5**, Black can play **Bxd1**, **Kxd1** \u2014 but wait:\n\n- **Bxc5** \u2014 bishop takes c5 pawn.\n- Then **Bxd1** \u2014 black bishop takes white's queen? But there is no queen.\n\nWait \u2014 **Bxd1** would be **capturing the rook on a1?** No \u2014 d1 is occupied by **White's king?** No \u2014 king is on e1.\n\nd1 is **empty**? Let's see:\n\nFEN: `2kr1bnr/pp3ppp/8/2p5/3B2b1/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R`\n\nSo:\n\n- d8: rook\n- c8: king\n- b8: knight\n- a8: rook\n- d1: ? \u2014 between c1 and e1.\n\nWhite: king on e1, bishop on f1, rook on h1, knight on b1, rook on a1.\n\nSo **d1 is empty**.\n\nSo after **Bxc5**, Black can play **Bxd1**, **removing the bishop on d4?** No \u2014 the bishop on d4 is now on c5.\n\nWait \u2014 **Bxc5** \u2014 White plays that.\n\nThen **Bxd1** \u2014 Black's bishop takes on d1 \u2014 but d1 is empty.\n\nNo \u2014 **Bxd1** would be **capturing a piece on d1**, but there is none.\n\nSo **Bxc5** is **safe** \u2014 no immediate recapture.\n\nBut what about **Qd2** or something? No \u2014 no queen.\n\nBut **after Bxc5**, Black can play **Bxf1**, perhaps?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- **1. Bxc5 Bxf1**\n- **2. Kxf1** \u2014 king takes bishop.\n\nNow we have an extra pawn, but we lost the bishop pair and king is exposed.\n\nBut material: we gained a pawn, lost a bishop, Black lost a bishop \u2014 so **we are up a pawn**.\n\nBut is that good?\n\nAlternatively, Black may not take \u2014 just retreat.\n\nSo **Bxc5** wins a clean pawn?\n\nWait \u2014 is **c5** defended?\n\nBlack has pawns on b7 and d7? No \u2014 FEN: `pp3ppp` on second rank \u2014 so a7,b7, f7,g7,h7 \u2014 so **b7 pawn** is on b7.\n\nSo **c5 pawn** is supported by **b7 pawn**? No \u2014 b7 is one file over.\n\nc5 pawn \u2014 is it isolated?\n\nYes \u2014 no adjacent pawns. So **c5 pawn is isolated**.\n\nSo **Bxc5** captures an isolated pawn \u2014 and it's **not defended** \u2014 because b7 pawn doesn't defend c5.\n\nSo **Bxc5 is a free pawn**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after **Bxc5**, Black plays **Bxd1**? No \u2014 d1 is empty.\n\nOr **Bxf1** \u2014 yes, that\u2019s possible.\n\nSo:\n\n- **1. Bxc5 Bxf1**\n- **2. Kxf1**\n\nNow White is up a pawn, but king is exposed, and we lost the bishop.\n\nBut we still have the other bishop.\n\nAlternatively, Black may not take \u2014 just retreat the bishop.\n\nSo **Bxc5** is **winning a pawn for free**, unless there's a tactic.\n\nBut let\u2019s check if **c5** is protected.\n\nBlack\u2019s pieces: king on c8, rook on d8, bishop on f8, knight on g8, bishop on g4.\n\nNone of them attack c5.\n\nb7 pawn \u2014 attacks c6, not c5.\n\nSo **c5 pawn is undefended**.\n\nTherefore, **Bxc5 wins a pawn**.\n\nAnd after that, even if Black takes on f1, we recapture, and we\u2019re up a pawn.\n\nSo **d4c5** is very strong.\n\nBut is there a better move?\n\nWhat about **f1e3** \u2014 defending the bishop?\n\nThat would be **Be3**, defending d4, so the bishop is safe.\n\nBut then we haven\u2019t gained anything \u2014 just defended.\n\nBut **Bxc"
