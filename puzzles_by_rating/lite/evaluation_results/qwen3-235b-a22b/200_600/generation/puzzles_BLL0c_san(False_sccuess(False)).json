If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

A quiet developing move, preparing to reroute the knight via f8 or g5. Not very active.\n2. **c8b8** \u2013 King retreats to b8. Gets out of the pin\u2019s line and prepares to support the queenside. Might be useful to avoid tactics.\n3. **e7g6** \u2013 Bishop to g6. Develops the bishop, attacks the e6 pawn, and eyes h5. But does it break the pin? Let\u2019s see: after Bg6, the king is still on c8, and the b6-bishop still points at it. But the diagonal is now blocked. However, **after Bg6, is there a discovered attack?**  \n   - If Black plays ...Bg6, then the e-file is opened between the black king and white\u2019s rook on d6? No \u2014 king is on c8, rook on d6 \u2014 not on same file.  \n   - But **White has a bishop on f2**, which is on the e1\u2013h4 diagonal. If the black bishop moves from e7, and the king is on c8, is there a discovered check?  \n     - Only if the white bishop is aligned with the black king. f2 to c8? f2\u2013c8 is a diagonal: f2, e3, d4, c5, b6, a7 \u2014 no, c8 is not on that diagonal. So **no discovered check**.\n   - So **Bg6 is safe**.\n   - Also, **Bg6 attacks e6**, which is a key white pawn. e6 is defended only by the bishop on f2 and the rook on d6.\n   - If Black plays ...Bg6, and later ...Bxe6, that could win a pawn.\n   - Also, ...Bg6 prepares ...Bf7 or ...Bh7, developing.\n\n4. **e7c6** \u2013 Bishop to c6. Blocks the b6-bishop\u2019s pin, defends b7, and eyes a4. But moves away from kingside defense. Also, c6 is attacked by b6? b6 is white\u2019s bishop \u2014 so **Bc6 would be captured by Bxc6+**, and then **Bxc6+ Kxc6?? Rd8#** \u2014 wait:\n   - 1... Bc6?\n   - 2. Bxc6+ Kxc6\n   - 3. Rd8+ Kb6\n   - 4. Rxa8 \u2014 White wins a rook.\n   - Or 3... Kb7 4. Rxa8\n   - So **Bc6 loses the rook on a8**.\n   - Therefore, **e7c6 is a blunder** \u2014 **illegal? No, but losing**. Avoid.\n\n5. **e7f5** \u2013 Bishop to f5. Develops, eyes b1, but leaves e6 undefended. Also, not particularly active.\n\n6. **e7d5** \u2013 Bishop to d5. Central, but again, e6 becomes vulnerable. Also, d5 may be kicked by c4.\n\n7. **d7e8** \u2013 Knight? Wait \u2014 d7 has a pawn? No \u2014 in the FEN: `2k3nr/1p1bn1p1/...` \u2014 so on d7 is a **pawn**? No: `1p1bn1p1` \u2014 second rank: b7, p on d7? Let's decode:\n\nFEN: `2k3nr/1p1bn1p1/1B1RPp1p/1p5P/2P3P1/8/PP2BK2/8`\n\n- 8th rank: `2k3nr` \u2192 c8=K, f8=N, g8=R? No: `2k3nr` \u2192 two empty, k, three empty, n, r \u2192 so c8=K, h8=N, g8=R? Wait \u2014 `nr` at the end \u2192 h8=N, g8=R? But that would be knight on h8, rook on g8 \u2014 but in the legal moves, we have **h8h7**, so h8 is a knight.\n\nWait \u2014 `2k3nr` \u2192 positions:\n- a8: empty\n- b8: empty\n- c8: k\n- d8: empty\n- e8: empty\n- f8: empty\n- g8: n\n- h8: r\n\nWait \u2014 `3nr` means three empty, then n, then r \u2192 so f8: empty, g8: n, h8: r? But legal move is **h8h7**, which implies a piece on h8 moving to h7 \u2014 so h8 must be a knight? Contradiction.\n\nWait \u2014 let's re-parse:\n\n`2k3nr` \u2192 breakdown:\n- 2 empty (a8,b8)\n- k (c8)\n- 3 empty (d8,e8,f8)\n- n (g8)\n- r (h8)\n\nSo **g8 = knight**, **h8 = rook**\n\nBut legal moves include **h8h7** \u2014 that would be rook from h8 to h7.\n\nBut also, **no knight on h8** \u2014 knight is on g8.\n\nWait \u2014 FEN: `2k3nr` \u2014 yes, `3nr` means three squares empty, then n, then r \u2192 so g8=n, h8=r.\n\nBut the legal moves list includes **h8h7** \u2014 that\u2019s possible (rook move), and **e7g6**, etc.\n\nBut also, **no knight on h8** \u2014 knight is on g8.\n\nBut the legal moves do **not** include g8h6 or g8f7 \u2014 which would be knight moves.\n\nWait \u2014 this is a problem.\n\nWait \u2014 let's look at the **legal moves** provided:\n\n- h8h7 \u2192 rook from h8 to h7\n- c8b8 \u2192 king\n- e7g6, e7c6, etc. \u2192 bishop on e7\n- d7e8 \u2192 d7 to e8 \u2014 d7 is a **pawn**? FEN: second rank: `1p1bn1p1` \u2192 a7: empty, b7: p, c7: empty, d7: b, e7: n, f7: empty, g7: p, h7: empty? No:\n\n`1p1bn1p1` \u2192 1 empty, p, 1 empty, b, n, 1 empty, p, 1 empty\n\nSo:\n- a7: empty\n- b7: pawn\n- c7: empty\n- d7: bishop\n- e7: knight\n- f7: empty\n- g7: pawn\n- h7: empty\n\nWait \u2014 so **d7 = bishop**, **e7 = knight**\n\nBut the moves include **e7g6**, **e7c6**, **e7f5**, **e7d5** \u2014 all knight moves.\n\nAnd **d7e8**, **d7e6**, **d7c6** \u2014 bishop moves.\n\nSo:\n- Knight on e7\n- Bishop on d7\n\nFEN: `1p1bn1p1` \u2192 yes: 1,p,1,b,n,1,p,1 \u2192 so d7=bishop, e7=knight\n\nSo pieces:\n- Black:\n  - King: c8\n  - Rook: h8\n  - Knight: e7, g8\n  - Bishop: d7\n  - Pawns: b7, b5, f6, g7, h6\n\nWhite:\n- Rook: d6\n- Bishop: b6, f2\n- Pawn: e6, c4, g4, h5, etc.\n\nNow, **e7 is a knight**, not a bishop.\n\nSo moves like **"
