White has a knight, Black has a bishop. Both sides have 4 pawns.\n\n### Key Features:\n- Black to move.\n- Black's rook on a2 is attacking the b1-rook.\n- White's knight on d5 is strong, controlling key central squares.\n- Black's bishop on h4 is active, eyeing the weak g3 and f2 squares.\n- White's king is on g1 \u2014 potentially vulnerable to back-rank issues.\n- Black's king is on g8, relatively safe for now.\n- The open **b-file** is contested.\n- Black's rook on a2 is **pinning** the b1 rook if the white king were on the b-file, but it's not \u2014 so the rook can move.\n\n### Threats:\n- If Black plays ...Bf2+, that\u2019s a **check**, and it attacks the white king with the bishop.\n- White's rook on b1 is under attack by the rook on a2. If it moves, Black might win material or gain initiative.\n- Black must be careful not to allow a trade of rooks that favors White, especially if the king becomes exposed.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate **candidate moves**:\n\n---\n\n### Candidate: **Rg2+**\n- **Rg2+**: Rook to g2 with check.\n  - After 35...Rg2+, White must play Kxg2 (only legal move).\n  - Then Black plays **Bf2+**, forking king and rook!\n    - After K moves (say Kf1 or Kh1), Black captures the rook on b1.\n  - Let's see:\n    - 35...Rg2+ 36. Kxg2 Bf2+\n    - 37. Kg1 (only) Bxb1\n    - Now Black is **up a rook** (B + R vs N + R), so material advantage: rook for knight.\n    - Black has a bishop and rook vs rook and knight \u2014 but bishop and rook often coordinate better.\n    - Also, Black has more active pieces.\n\n  This looks **very strong**.\n\n  But wait \u2014 after 35...Rg2+ 36. Kxg2 Bf2+, is there any escape for White?\n\n  - 37. Kh1? Bxb1 \u2014 Black wins rook.\n  - 37. Kg1? Bxb1 \u2014 same.\n  - No interference possible.\n\n  So Black wins a rook for a knight \u2014 **clear material gain**.\n\n---\n\nCompare to other moves:\n\n- **Bf2+**: 35...Bf2+ 36. Kg2 (only) Rg2+! \u2014 transposes to the same line.\n  - So 35...Bf2+ 36. Kg2 Rg2+ 37. Kh1 Bxb1 \u2014 same result.\n  - But after 35...Bf2+, White plays Kg2, then Rg2+ is still winning.\n\n  However, playing **Rg2+ first** is **more forcing** because it\u2019s a check \u2014 White **must** take the rook, leading to the fork.\n\n  If Black plays Bf2+ first, White might have more psychological chance to blunder, but objectively both work.\n\n  But **Rg2+** comes with check and forces the king to capture, so it\u2019s more direct.\n\n- Other rook moves like Ra3, Ra4, Ra1 \u2014 passive or non-forcing.\n- Be7, Bd8 \u2014 retreating the bishop, bad.\n- f6, g6 \u2014 weakening, no urgency.\n- h5 \u2014 possible, but slow.\n- Rh2 \u2014 attacks h2, but no immediate threat.\n\nBut **Rg2+** leads to a forced win of material.\n\n### Is there any refutation?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check:\n\n**35...Rg2+!**\n- 36. Kxg2 Bf2+\n- 37. Kg1 (Kh1 loses rook too) Bxb1\n- Black is up a rook for a knight \u2014 decisive advantage.\n\nEven if White tries 36. Kh1?? \u2014 but no, Rg2+ is check, and king must capture: only Kg2 is legal.\n\nWait \u2014 **Kg2** is the only legal move to get out of check.\n\nSo yes: **35...Rg2+ 36. Kg2 Bf2+ 37. Kh1 Bxb1** \u2014 Black wins the rook.\n\nAlternatively, 37. Kg1 Bxb1 \u2014 same.\n\nNo way for White to avoid losing the rook.\n\nAnd after that, Black has excellent winning chances: extra rook, active pieces, and potential for coordination.\n\n### Conclusion:\n**35...Rg2+** is a **forcing move** that wins material (rook for knight) and gives Black a decisive advantage.\n\nIt\u2019s the best move.\n\n```\nRg2+\n```"
