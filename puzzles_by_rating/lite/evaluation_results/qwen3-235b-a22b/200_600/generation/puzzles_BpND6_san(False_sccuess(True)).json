If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

The only legal move listed is **c6d8**, which means the knight on c6 must move to d8.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position carefully.\n\n### Positional Assessment:\n- Black king is on g8, relatively safe for now.\n- White has a rook on d8 (Rd8), queen on b5 (Qb5), knight on e3 (Ne3), pawns on e4, g3, c3, a2, b2.\n- Black has a rook on f6 (Rf6), knight on c6 (Nc6), pawn on e5, and a dangerous queen on h3 (Qh3), which is attacking the g3-pawn and potentially threatening mate on h2 if not careful.\n- The black queen on h3 is extremely dangerous \u2014 it\u2019s one move away from checkmating on h2 if the g3-pawn is gone or blocked.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **Qh3 is attacking g3**, and if White is not careful, ...Qxg3+ followed by ...Qh2# is a threat. However, White just played a move, and now it's Black\u2019s turn.\n\nBut the **only legal move listed is c6d8** \u2014 that suggests that all other moves are either illegal or not listed. But we must verify if that's truly the only legal move.\n\nLet\u2019s double-check:\n\n### Is ...Nc6-d8 the only legal move?\n\n- **Black king on g8**: not in check.\n- Possible king moves: Kg8-f8, Kg8-h8 \u2014 are they legal?\n  - Kf8: would it walk into check? White has a rook on d8. Rd8 attacks along the 8th rank. So if Black king goes to f8, it would be on the same rank as Rd8 \u2014 but d8 to f8 is along the 8th rank, so yes, **Kf8 is illegal** \u2014 it would be moving into check from Rd8.\n  - Kh8: is that safe? Rd8 does not attack h8 (it's on the same rank, but h8 is not in the line \u2014 d8 to h8 is 4 squares right, so yes, Rd8 attacks h8. So **Kh8 is also in check** \u2014 so illegal.\n  - Therefore, **king has no legal moves**.\n\n- **Rook on f6**: can it move?\n  - Rf6-f8? But Rd8 is on d8 \u2014 same rank. Rf6 to f8 would be on 8th rank. Rd8 controls the 8th rank. So Rf6-f8: would that be possible? Yes, if it's not blocked. But f-file is clear. But is f8 attacked? Rd8 attacks f8 \u2014 so if Black plays Rf6-f8, it would be captured? No \u2014 it's not a capture, but placing a rook on f8 when White already has a rook on d8 \u2014 but that\u2019s allowed unless it's occupied. f8 is empty. But is it safe?\n\nWait \u2014 **Rf6-f8**: is that legal? Yes, unless it\u2019s pinned or the square is attacked. But the square f8 is under control of White\u2019s rook on d8 \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t make the move illegal. A piece can move to a square attacked by the opponent \u2014 it's just risky.\n\nBut why isn't it in the legal moves list?\n\nThe problem says: **Legal moves in UCI notation: c6d8**\n\nThat implies that **c6d8 is the only legal move**.\n\nSo either:\n- The engine or interface only lists c6d8 as legal, meaning all other moves are illegal.\n\nSo let\u2019s check if **Rf6-f8** is legal:\n- After Rf6-f8, White plays Rxd8, winning the rook. But that\u2019s a tactical consideration \u2014 not an illegality.\n\nBut the move should still be legal.\n\nUnless... is the rook on f6 **pinned**?\n\n- The rook is on f6, king on g8. Is there a diagonal or line where moving the rook would expose the king?\n\nNo \u2014 the rook moves along the f-file or 6th rank. Moving it to f8 doesn't open any diagonal to the king. The king is on g8, rook on f6 \u2014 they are adjacent, but moving the rook up the file doesn\u2019t expose the king to a check.\n\nSo why isn't Rf6-f8 legal?\n\nWait \u2014 is the **black queen on h3** giving a check? No \u2014 it's Black\u2019s turn, and the king is not in check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the **only legal move is c6d8** because all other pieces are pinned or have no legal moves.\n\nWait \u2014 **Nd8 is a knight move from c6 to d8**.\n\nBut **d8 is occupied by a white rook** \u2014 so **c6d8** would be a **capture**: Nc6xd8.\n\nAh! That makes sense.\n\nSo **c6d8** means **Nc6 takes on d8**, capturing the white rook.\n\nNow, is that legal?\n\n- Is the knight on c6 attacking d8? Knight on c6: possible moves \u2014 b8, d8, e7, e5, a5, b4, etc.\n\nFrom c6 to d8: that\u2019s a knight move (one up, two right \u2014 or two up, one right? c6 to d8: c to d is +1, 6 to 8 is +2 \u2014 so yes, knight move: up two, right one \u2014 valid.\n\nAnd d8 has a white rook \u2014 so **Nc6xd8** is a legal capture.\n\nNow, why is it the only legal move?\n\nLet\u2019s check if the king is in check.\n\n- Is Black in check?\n\nWhite has:\n- Rook on d8: attacks along d-file and 8th rank. Black king is on g8 \u2014 same 8th rank. So **Rd8 is attacking g8** \u2014 yes! The white rook on d8 is on the same rank as the black king \u2014 so **Black is in check**!\n\nAh! That\u2019s the key.\n\n**Black is in check by Rd8**.\n\nSo Black must get out of check.\n\nOptions:\n1. **Move the king** \u2014 but Kg8-f8 or Kg8-h8: both are on the 8th rank, which is controlled by Rd8 \u2014 so still in check. So illegal.\n2. **Block the check** \u2014 is there any piece that can block the rook\u2019s attack on the 8th rank? The rook is on d8, king on g8 \u2014 so the squares e8, f8 are between. Can a piece go to e8 or f8?\n\n- Black has:\n  - Queen on h3 \u2014 too far, can\u2019t block.\n  - Rook on f6 \u2014 can it go to f8? f8 is between d8 and g8? d8, e8, f8, g8 \u2014 yes, f8 is on the line. So **Rf6-f8** would block the check.\n\nSo **Rf6-f8** should be a legal move \u2014 it blocks the check.\n\nBut the legal moves list only shows **c6d8**.\n\nWait \u2014 is **Rf6-f8** possible?\n\n- f8 is empty.\n- Rook can move vertically \u2014 yes.\n- It would block the check \u2014 yes.\n\nSo why isn't it listed?\n\nUnless... is f8 attacked? That doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 blocking is allowed even if the square is attacked.\n\nBut perhaps after Rf6-f8, is the king still in check? No \u2014 the rook on f6 would be on f8, blocking the line between Rd8 and Kg8.\n\nSo it should be legal.\n\nBut the only legal move listed is **c6d8** \u2014 which is **Nc6xd8**, capturing the checking rook.\n\nSo that must be the only legal way to get out of check \u2014 unless blocking is not possible.\n\nWait \u2014 is the **rook on f6 pinned**?\n\n- The rook is on f6, king on g8 \u2014 they are adjacent (f6 to g8 is two up, one right \u2014 not adjacent). f6 and g8 are not on the same line directly.\n\nBut is there a diagonal attacker?\n\nWhite has:\n- Queen on b5 \u2014 b5 to g8? b5 to g8 is 5 files right, 3 up \u2014 not a diagonal.\n- No bishop or queen on a diagonal to g8.\n- e4 pawn \u2014 no.\n- Ne3 \u2014 no.\n\nSo no diagonal attacker.\n\nBut what about the **f-file**? Is there a white piece on the f-file? No.\n\nSo the rook is not pinned.\n\nSo **Rf6-f8** should be a legal block.\n\nBut it\u2019s not in the legal moves list.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the **queen on h3** is the issue.\n\nWait \u2014 after **Rf6-f8**, does it leave the king exposed elsewhere?\n\nNo \u2014 the only check is from Rd8, which is blocked.\n\nSo why is only **c6d8** listed?\n\nPossibility: **f"
