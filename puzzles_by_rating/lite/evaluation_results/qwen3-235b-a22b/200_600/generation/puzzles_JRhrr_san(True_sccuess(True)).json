The e4 pawn may also advance, but it's far from promotion.\n\nCurrent legal moves for Black:  \n`Kb3, Ka3, Kb2, Kb1, Ka1, a5`\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each:\n\n1. **a5** \u2013 Advances the pawn, but this may be premature. After a5, White plays Kf7, then Ke6, Kd5, etc., and will capture the pawn easily. Also, it blocks the a-pawn from supporting the king.\n\n2. **Kb3** \u2013 Centralizes the king a bit, supports the a6 pawn, and prepares to escort the pawn. But after Kb3, White plays Kf7, then marches to capture a6.\n\n3. **Ka3** \u2013 Stays on the edge, not ideal. Loses a tempo compared to Kb3.\n\n4. **Kb2** \u2013 This keeps the king near the center of the action and supports the a-pawn. Also, it's one step toward the center.\n\n5. **Kb1** \u2013 Retreats, seems passive.\n\n6. **Ka1** \u2013 Even more passive, heading to the corner.\n\nBut let's think deeper.\n\n### Key idea:\nBlack must **prevent the White king from reaching a6** without losing the pawn. However, with the White king on g8, it will take 6 moves to reach a6 (g8-f7-e6-d5-c4-b3-a4-a5-a6), while the Black king is already close.\n\nBut the a6 pawn is on the 6th rank \u2014 it's only 3 moves from queening: a6-a5-a4-a3-a2-a1=Q.\n\nWait \u2014 it's on a6, so it needs to go a5, a4, a3, a2, a1=Q \u2014 that's 5 moves.\n\nBut Black can support it.\n\nHowever, White can play Kf7, Ke6, Kd5, Kc4, Kb3, and then capture the pawn if not careful.\n\nBut let's calculate:\n\nAfter **...a5**, the pawn is on a5.\n\nThen White: Kf7, Black: Kb3, White: Ke6, Black: Kb4, White: Kd5, Black: Kb5, White: Kc3, Black: a4, etc.\n\nBut Black can **start with Kb3**, preparing to support the pawn.\n\nBut the best move is likely **...Kb2**, centralizing and keeping flexibility.\n\nWait \u2014 let's consider **...Kb1** or **...Kb2** \u2014 why?\n\nActually, the key is **opposition** and **zugzwang**.\n\nBut more importantly: **Black must advance the pawn at the right time**.\n\nHowever, if Black never advances the pawn, it's a draw, but White might make progress.\n\nBut here, **Black can try to queen the a-pawn**, but the White king is far, and the Black king is close.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate a critical line.\n\nSuppose:\n1. ... a5?  \n2. Kf7 Kb3  \n3. Ke6 Kc4  \n4. Kd6 Kd4  \n5. Kc6 Ke5  \n6. Kb6 Kd6  \n7. Kxa5 Kc7  \n8. Kb5 Kb7  \n9. a5 Ka7  \n10. a6 Ka8  \n11. Kb6 Kb8  \n12. a7+ Ka8  \n13. Kc7 checkmate \u2014 White wins.\n\nSo if Black plays ...a5 too early, White captures and queens.\n\nBut if Black **delays** the pawn move, White can approach.\n\nSo the idea is: **keep the king active and force White to come closer, then advance the pawn when the king can support it**.\n\nBest plan: **Bring the king to b4 or b5**, then play a5, a4, etc., with king support.\n\nSo the best move now is **...Kb3**, centralizing and preparing to support the pawn.\n\nBut let's compare:\n\n- **...Kb3**: king moves toward the center, supports a5 push next.\n- **...Kb2**: also good, keeps king flexible.\n\nBut **...Kb3** is more active.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a risk?\n\nAfter ...Kb3, White plays Kf7.\n\nThen Black can play a5.\n\nThen White: Ke6, Black: Kb4.\n\nWhite: Kd5, Black: Kb5.\n\nNow White: Kc3, Black: a4.\n\nThen Black king can go to b6, and support the pawn.\n\nBut White king may not catch it.\n\nAlternatively, **...Kb2** allows the king to go to b1, c1, etc., but not necessary.\n\nBut actually, **...Kb3** is better.\n\nWait \u2014 let's check if **...a5** immediately is better?\n\nNo \u2014 as shown earlier, White can capture it later with king march.\n\nBut if Black plays **...Kb2** first, then White Kf7, Black can play ...a5 next.\n\nSame idea.\n\nBut **...Kb3** gains more ground.\n\nHowever, there is a subtlety: **king activity and opposition**.\n\nAnother idea: **...Kb1** or **...Kb2** to lose a tempo, if needed.\n\nBut here, we want to gain tempi.\n\nBest move: **...Kb3** \u2014 it's the most direct way to support the a-pawn and prepare a5.\n\nBut let's see if **...Kb2** is better for triangulation?\n\nNot really \u2014 the position is not yet critical.\n\nAlternatively, **...Ka3** is worse \u2014 it's on the edge.\n\nAfter evaluating:\n\n- **...a5**: premature, loses after Kf7, etc.\n- **...Ka3/Ka1**: passive\n- **...Kb1**: not bad, but less active\n- **...Kb2**: good, flexible\n- **...Kb3**: most active, prepares a5 with support\n\nBut wait \u2014 after ...Kb3, if White plays Kf7, then Black plays a5, then White Ke6, Black Kb4, White Kd5, Black Kb5, White Kc3, Black a4, then Black king to b6, and the pawn may queen.\n\nBut White king can go Kb4, then a3, and win?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAfter ...a4, White Kc3, Black Kb6, White Kb4, Black Kc6, White Kxa4 Kc7, then it's drawish?\n\nBut White has e4 pawn \u2014 that could be dangerous.\n\nWait \u2014 White has a pawn on e4 \u2014 it's on the 4th rank, so it needs 3 moves to promote: e5, e6, e7, e8=Q.\n\nBut Black king is far.\n\nSo **White has two threats**:\n- Capture a6/a5/a4 pawn and promote it\n- Promote e4 pawn\n\nBut Black can try to stop both.\n\nBut likely, **White is winning**, but Black must try to draw.\n\nBut our job is to find the best move.\n\nPerhaps **...Kb2** is better because it keeps the king on the second rank, ready to go to c1 or b1 if needed, and avoids blocking the a-pawn.\n\nBut Kb3 doesn't block the a-pawn.\n\na6 pawn can still move.\n\nAnother idea: **...Kb1** to prepare Kc1, Kd2, etc., but that's away.\n\nNo.\n\nBest practical chance: **start with ...Kb3**, then ...a5, and try to queen the a-pawn before White can stop it.\n\nBut White king is faster?\n\nLet\u2019s count moves to a1:\n\n- Black king from a2 to a1: 1 move, but not helpful.\n\n- a6 to a1: 5 moves (a5, a4, a3, a2, a1=Q)\n\n- White king from g8 to a1: g8-f7-e6-d5-c4-b3-a1: 6 moves.\n\nSo if Black can play a5, a4, a3, a2, a1=Q in 5 moves, and White takes 6 to reach a1, then **if the pawn is not blocked**, it queens.\n\nBut the e4 pawn may queen faster.\n\ne4 to e8: e5, e6, e7, e8=Q \u2014 4 moves.\n\nSo White can queen in 4 moves with the e-pawn.\n\nBlack cannot queen in 4 moves \u2014 needs 5.\n\nSo Black cannot win by queening first.\n\nTherefore, **Black cannot queen the a-pawn safely** \u2014 White will either capture it or queen first and checkmate.\n\nSo Black must **try to draw**.\n\nHow?\n\nBy **perpetual chase** or **stalemate** or **king blockade**.\n\nBut here, the best chance is"

However, with correct play, it might be able to promote if supported. The White pawn on e5 is also a potential threat, but it's not immediately dangerous.\n\nCurrent material: Equal (kings and one pawn each). But the position is very endgame-like, and the key will be king activity and pawn promotion.\n\nBlack's legal moves:  \n- Kc4, Kb4, Ka4  \n- Kc3, Ka3  \n- Kc2, Kb2, Ka2  \n- a5\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\n1. **a5** \u2013 This advances the pawn. But after a5, White can play Kf7 or Ke7, centralizing and threatening to race the king to support e5 or stop a5. However, the a-pawn is still far from promotion, and the king must support it. Playing a5 now might allow White to gain opposition or race their king.\n\n2. **King moves toward the center or up the board**:\n   - **Kc4**: Centralizes, threatens to support a5 and potentially control key squares. Also moves closer to the e5 pawn, which might be important.\n   - **Kb4**: Keeps the king on the b-file, supports a6, but less active than Kc4.\n   - **Ka4**: Moves toward the a-pawn, but edge of the board; less flexible.\n   - **Kc3, Kc2, etc.**: Moving backward seems passive.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider the **race**:\n\n- Black wants to promote the a-pawn. To do that, the king should ideally support it.\n- White wants to promote the e-pawn or stop the a-pawn.\n\nBut note: White\u2019s king is on g8 \u2014 very far from the a-file. If Black can push the a-pawn with king support, it might queen first.\n\nHowever, White\u2019s e-pawn is much closer to promotion: only 4 moves from queening (e5-e6-e7-e8=Q). Black\u2019s a-pawn needs 5 moves (a6-a5-a4-a3-a2-a1=Q). But Black can start pushing it.\n\nBut if Black plays passively, White can play Ke7, Kd7, Kc7, Kb7, and pick up the a6 pawn.\n\nSo Black must either:\n- Race the king to support the a-pawn\u2019s promotion, or\n- Try to stop the e-pawn while advancing the a-pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 is the e-pawn going to queen?\n\nLet\u2019s see: e5-e6-e7-e8=Q \u2014 3 moves. But Black\u2019s king is far, but after ...a5, White must respond.\n\nBut Black doesn't need to stop the e-pawn if the a-pawn queens first.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate:\n\nSuppose:\n1. ... a5  \n2. e6 a4  \n3. e7 a3  \n4. e8=Q a2  \n5. Qe1 a1=Q  \n\u2192 Queen vs Queen \u2014 but White might have check first.\n\nBut after 5...a1=Q, both queens. But White\u2019s king is exposed, and Black may have drawing chances.\n\nBut better for Black: can we **prevent** e6?\n\nOnly if the king can reach d6 or f6 to block. But king is on b3 \u2014 too far.\n\nSo Black cannot stop e5-e6-e7-e8.\n\nTherefore, **if White is allowed to push e5-e6-e7-e8, they will queen first or at the same time**.\n\nBut let\u2019s see timing:\n\n- e5-e6: move 1  \n- e6-e7: move 2  \n- e7-e8: move 3\n\na6-a5: move 1  \na5-a4: move 2  \na4-a3: move 3  \na3-a2: move 4  \na2-a1: move 5\n\nSo the a-pawn takes 5 moves to queen, e-pawn takes 3.\n\nSo if Black just plays ...a5, White plays e6, then e7, e8=Q \u2014 in 3 moves.\n\nBlack\u2019s king is on b3 \u2014 can it stop e8?\n\nAfter ...a5, e6, Black can play ...Kc4? But that doesn\u2019t stop e7.\n\nOnly way to stop e-pawn is to control e6 or e7.\n\nBut from b3, king cannot reach e6 in time.\n\nAfter ...a5, e6, then e7 is next, unstoppable.\n\nSo the e-pawn will queen in 3 moves unless Black can capture it.\n\nCan Black\u2019s king capture the e5 pawn?\n\nFrom b3 to e5: minimum 4 moves (b3-c4-d5-e5). But White will just push e5-e6 before that.\n\nSo Black cannot stop the e-pawn.\n\nTherefore, **White is going to queen first unless Black can force a draw or win by other means**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is the position actually a **draw** if both queens?\n\nBut after e8=Q, White can check, and Black\u2019s king is exposed.\n\nBut Black\u2019s a-pawn is still on a5 or a4 \u2014 not queened yet.\n\nSo White queens first, then can use the queen to stop the a-pawn.\n\nFor example:\n1. ... a5  \n2. e6 a4  \n3. e7 a3  \n4. e8=Q\n\nNow 4...a2, but 5. Qe1 stops promotion.\n\nThen White can pick up the a-pawn later.\n\nSo Black cannot queen.\n\nAlternatively, if Black tries to run the king toward e5, say ...Kc4, then e6, ...Kd5, e7, ...Kd6, e8=Q \u2014 again, White queens with check or immediate threat.\n\nSo White will promote first and stop the a-pawn.\n\nThus, **Black cannot prevent White from queening, and once queened, White can stop the a-pawn**.\n\nBut is there a way to **draw**?\n\nWait \u2014 is the position actually **stalemate** or **zugzwang**?\n\nNo, Black has moves.\n\nBut perhaps Black can **sacrifice the pawn** and use the king to stalemate?\n\nFor example, if the a-pawn is gone, and Black\u2019s king is in a corner, maybe White cannot make progress.\n\nBut White has a king and queen \u2014 they can force checkmate.\n\nSo if both sides queen, White wins.\n\nBut if Black avoids queening and instead tries to **force a draw by stalemate or insufficient mating material**, but White will have king + queen vs king \u2014 easy win.\n\nSo Black is **losing** if the e-pawn queens.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is the e-pawn really unstoppable?\n\nWhat if Black plays **...Kc4**, threatening to march to d5 and eventually e6?\n\nBut after ...Kc4, White plays e6, then e7, and queens.\n\nSame thing.\n\nAlternatively, **...Kb4** or **...Ka4** \u2014 trying to support a5.\n\nBut still, e5-e6-e7-e8 happens in 3 moves.\n\nUnless Black can **check** or something \u2014 but no checks.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a **draw** by **opposition** or **king blockade**?\n\nAnother idea: **can Black\u2019s king reach a8 or b8 and create a fortress**?\n\nBut White will queen and force the win.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider: after e8=Q, Black has a king and a pawn. White has king and queen.\n\nWhite can always win this endgame \u2014 king + queen vs king + pawn \u2014 unless the pawn is about to queen and can force perpetual, but in this case, the a-pawn is too slow.\n\nSo **White is winning**.\n\nBut Black must try to **draw**.\n\nIs there a way to **lose a tempo** or **force stalemate**?\n\nWait \u2014 what if Black plays **...Ka3** or **...Ka2**, heading toward a1?\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t help.\n\nAlternatively, **...Kc2**, **...Kc1**, etc. \u2014 but that\u2019s passive.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps Black can **allow** the e-pawn to queen, but then **sacrifice the a-pawn** and **stalemate** the White king?\n\nBut White king is on g8 \u2014 central, not near edge.\n\nAfter e8=Q, White king is free to move.\n\nNo stalemate in sight.\n\nAlternatively, **perpetual check**? But Black has no queen yet.\n\nSo Black seems **lost**.\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check: is the e-pawn really going to queen?\n\nWait \u2014 after ...a5, e6, a4, e7, a3, e8=Q, a2.\n\nNow if Black plays a1=Q, then Qe1+ or Qe2+ or Qe3+ stops the queen.\n\nBut Black can play ...Kc4, trying to create counterplay.\n\nBut White can just play Qe2 or Qe3, controlling a2.\n\nEventually, White will win the a-pawn and checkmate.\n\nSo yes, White"

It's Black's turn to move.\n\n### Key Observations:\n- White's pawn on e6 is one square away from queening (e7 and then e8=Q). However, it's currently blocked and not immediately promoting.\n- White's king is on g8, very far from the action on the queenside.\n- Black's king is on b3, close to the a5-pawn and can support its advance.\n- Black's pawn on a5 is on the 5th rank, so it can advance to a4 or a3 in two moves.\n- The position is a **king and pawn endgame**, and the key is **zugzwang** or **race to support pawns**.\n\n### Goal:\n- Black must try to **promote the a-pawn**.\n- White will try to queen the e-pawn, but it's far away \u2014 however, White's king is closer to e6 than Black's king is to a5.\n\nBut let's calculate:\n\n- **Black's a-pawn** needs 5 moves to promote: a5 \u2192 a4 \u2192 a3 \u2192 a2 \u2192 a1=Q.\n- **White's e-pawn** needs 2 moves: e6-e7-e8=Q.\n- So **White is very close to queening** \u2014 only 2 moves away.\n\nBut it's **Black's move now**. After Black moves, White will play e7, then e8=Q next move.\n\nSo if Black doesn't **prevent e7**, White will queen in one move.\n\nWait \u2014 the FEN says: `e6` and it's Black to move. But the move history says: `Kb3, e5, a5, e6`, so move 49 is Black's fifth move? Let's clarify the move count.\n\nFEN: `... b - - 0 49` \u2192 Black to move, move number 49.\n\nSo the full move list is up to 48 full moves, now Black plays 49th move.\n\nBut White just played **49. e6?** \u2014 wait, no: the partial SAN is: `Kb3, e5, a5, e6`\n\nThat seems to be:\n1. Kb3 (White)\n2. e5 (Black)\n3. a5 (White?)\nWait \u2014 that can't be. SAN doesn't specify color.\n\nWait \u2014 the moves are listed as: `Kb3, e5, a5, e6`\n\nBut it's Black to move now, and the last move must have been by White.\n\nSo the sequence is likely:\n- Move 48: White plays Kb3\n- Black plays ...e5\n- Move 49: White plays a5? No, a5 is Black's pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 this is confusing.\n\nLet\u2019s re-analyze the **partial move history**: `Kb3, e5, a5, e6`\n\nGiven that it's Black to move now (move 49), the last move was by White.\n\nSo the last four moves (from move 48 onwards?) are:\n\n- 48. Kb3 (White)\n- 48... e5 (Black)\n- 49. e6 (White) \u2014 just played\n- Now Black to move on 49th move.\n\nBut the FEN says `e6`, and it's Black to move \u2014 so yes, White just played **e6**, advancing the pawn to e6, and now Black must respond.\n\nSo White's pawn is on e6, one step from e7.\n\nBut **White can play e7 next**, then e8=Q.\n\nSo Black **must stop e7** if possible \u2014 but how?\n\nBlack's king is on b3. The only way to stop e7 is if Black can capture or blockade, but the e-pawn is on e6, and Black has no pieces near it.\n\nSo **Black cannot stop White from playing e7** next move.\n\nAfter:\n1... (any move)\n2. e7, then 3. e8=Q\n\nSo White will queen in two moves.\n\nBut Black may try to **race** \u2014 promote first.\n\nBut Black's a-pawn is on a5. It needs:\n- a5 \u2192 a4 \u2192 a3 \u2192 a2 \u2192 a1 = 4 moves\n\nWhite's e-pawn:\n- e6 \u2192 e7 \u2192 e8 = 2 moves\n\nSo White will queen in **2 moves**, Black in **4 moves** \u2014 so White wins unless Black can **prevent e7**.\n\nBut Black cannot prevent e7 \u2014 no piece can reach e7.\n\nUnless... is there **stalemate** or **king activity**?\n\nWait \u2014 what if Black **forces a draw** by stalemate or by promoting with check?\n\nBut a1 queen doesn't give check.\n\nAlternatively, can Black **invade** and disrupt?\n\nBut White's king is on g8, far away.\n\nWait \u2014 **White's king is on g8**, and after queening, it can come to help.\n\nBut Black's only hope is **if White promotes and then Black can force a draw by stalemate or perpetual**, but unlikely.\n\nAlternatively \u2014 is the position already **drawn**?\n\nWait \u2014 let's see: after Black moves, White plays e7.\n\nThen Black plays ...a4.\n\nThen White plays e8=Q.\n\nNow White has a queen, Black has a pawn on a4.\n\nWhite can then stop the a-pawn.\n\nBut Black's king is on b3 \u2014 can it support the pawn?\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\nCurrent position: Black to move.\n\nSuppose Black plays **...a4**\n\nThen:\n1. e7 a3\n2. e8=Q a2\n3. Qe2+ (or Qb5+) Kb4\n4. Qa6 or Qb1, and the a-pawn is stopped.\n\nOr 3... Kb2, Qb5+ etc.\n\nWhite wins easily.\n\nBut what if Black **moves the king toward the center**?\n\nBut that doesn't help \u2014 the a-pawn is left behind.\n\nAlternatively \u2014 **is there a stalemate idea**?\n\nWait \u2014 after White promotes, if Black has no legal moves, but that's impossible unless king is trapped.\n\nBut king is on b3, plenty of moves.\n\nWait \u2014 another idea: **can Black force a draw by underpromotion or counterplay**?\n\nNo \u2014 Black has no checks.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps **Black can sacrifice the a-pawn** to draw?\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively \u2014 is the position **already a draw** because White cannot win even after queening?\n\nNo \u2014 White can queen and stop the a-pawn.\n\nBut let\u2019s calculate **king movement**.\n\nAfter:\n1. ... a4\n2. e7 a3\n3. e8=Q a2\n4. Qe1! \u2014 controls a1, so a1=Q is met by Qxa1.\n\nSo Black cannot promote.\n\nSimilarly, if Black tries ...Kc2, White plays e7, then e8=Q, and queen controls a1.\n\nSo **Black cannot promote** because the white queen will control the queening square.\n\nTherefore, **Black cannot stop White from queening, and after queening, White can prevent Black's pawn from promoting**.\n\nSo **White is winning**.\n\nBut is there a **draw**?\n\nWait \u2014 what if Black **does not push the pawn**, but instead **moves the king toward the e-pawn**?\n\nFor example, ...Kc4, trying to attack e6?\n\nBut after ...Kc4, White plays e7, then e8=Q, and the king is not close enough.\n\nBlack king on c4, White queen on e8 \u2014 queen can easily stop a-pawn.\n\nBut Black's a-pawn is still on a5.\n\nAfter ...Kc4, White e7, then Black can play ...a4, but same issue.\n\nAlternatively \u2014 **can Black force a stalemate**?\n\nFor example, if White is careless, but with correct play, no.\n\nBut let\u2019s think: **is there a way to draw**?\n\nWait \u2014 **the key idea**: if Black can **promote with check**, it might draw.\n\nBut a1 is not a checking square unless the king is on a1 or b1.\n\nBut White's king is on g8.\n\nSo no.\n\nAlternatively \u2014 **can Black's king reach a1 in time**?\n\nNo \u2014 irrelevant.\n\nWait \u2014 another idea: **if Black allows White to queen, but then sacrifices the pawn to force a draw by insufficient material or stalemate**?\n\nBut after queening, White has queen vs king \u2014 wins easily.\n\nUnless the position is such that the queen cannot force win \u2014 but it can.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps **Black can create a fortress**?\n\nUnlikely.\n\nBut let\u2019s check **if the a-pawn can be stopped**.\n\nActually, **White can always stop the a-pawn** after queening.\n\nBut here\u2019s a **critical point**: **after White plays e7, Black can play ...a4**, but then e8=Q, and now if Black plays ...a3, White can play Qe1, controlling a1.\n\nBut if Black plays ...Kc2, then Qe2+! \u2014 skewer or something.\n\nBut still, White wins.\n\nBut is there a **draw by stalemate**?\n\nFor example, if Black's king"

My king is on b3, and I have a passed pawn on a4. White's king is on g8, far away from the action on the queenside.\n\nWhite's pawn is on e7 and will promote on the next move unless stopped. However, it's Black to move now (indicated by 'b' in the FEN). My task is to find the best move from the legal moves provided:\n\nLegal moves: **Kc4, Kb4, Kc3, Ka3, Kc2, Kb2, Ka2, a3**\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position carefully.\n\nWhite is about to play e8=Q (or some promotion) next move. If I don\u2019t prevent that, White will have a queen, which is likely decisive. However, in this position, my king is close to the a-pawn, which is a passed pawn and might be able to promote if supported.\n\nBut let's assess:\n\n- White's pawn on e7 will promote next move.\n- My king is on b3; my pawn on a4.\n- If I push a3, then a2, a1=Q \u2014 but I need two moves to promote (a3, then a2), and after a3, White plays e8=Q, then Qa4+ or Qxa4, stopping my pawn.\n- Alternatively, if I advance my king toward the a-pawn, I might support its promotion.\n\nBut here's the key: **White is about to promote no matter what**, unless I can stop it \u2014 but I can't. So I must try to create counterplay with my a-pawn.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the race:\n\n- After any move by Black, White plays e8=Q.\n- Then White has a queen, and I have a pawn on a4 and king on b3 or nearby.\n- Can I promote my a-pawn before White can capture it?\n\nWhite\u2019s king is on g8 \u2014 very far. The queen will take at least one move to come to the queenside.\n\nSo the idea is: **promote my a-pawn as fast as possible, before the white queen can stop it.**\n\nMy pawn is on a4. It needs to go a3, a2, a1=Q \u2014 two more moves to promote.\n\nBut after I play a3, White plays e8=Q, then on the next move, the queen can go to a5, a4, or b4, potentially stopping a2.\n\nBut if my king is close enough, I might still promote.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate candidate moves.\n\n### 1. **a3** \u2014 immediate push.\n\nAfter **a3**, White plays **e8=Q**. Now position is:\n\n- Black: Ka3 or wherever, a3\n- White: Qe8, Kg8\n\nNow it's my move. I can play **a2**. Then White must stop the promotion.\n\nQueen goes to b5+, or a5+, or c5+, checking to gain time.\n\nFor example:  \n1... a3  \n2. e8=Q a2  \n3. Qb5+ Ka3 (or Kc3)  \n4. Qa5+ Kb3  \n5. Qb4+ Kc3  \n6. Qa3+ Kc2  \n7. Qb2+ Kd3  \n8. Qxa2 \u2014 eventually White captures.\n\nBut I might get counterplay.\n\nBut I don't have enough time \u2014 White will promote and then stop my pawn.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **stalemate** or **draw** resource?\n\nLet\u2019s think differently.\n\nWhite\u2019s king is on g8, my king is on b3.\n\nIf I move my king toward the center or stay passive, White promotes and wins.\n\nBut if I can **force a draw**, that\u2019s the best I can do.\n\nWait \u2014 is **stalemate** possible?\n\nLet\u2019s consider: after e8=Q, if my king has no legal moves and is not in check, and I have no other moves, it's stalemate.\n\nCurrently, I have pawn on a4 \u2014 so I have at least one legal move: a3. So no stalemate now.\n\nBut if I **give up the pawn**, maybe I can force stalemate?\n\nFor example, if I could get into a position where after White promotes, I have no legal moves.\n\nBut I have the a4 pawn \u2014 so I can always play a3.\n\nUnless I **lose the pawn** or **block it**.\n\nBut I want to promote it.\n\nAlternatively, if I **don\u2019t push the pawn**, and just move the king, I still have a3 as a legal move, so no stalemate.\n\nBut suppose I move my king to a2.\n\nThen after e8=Q, I have pawn on a4, king on a2 \u2014 I can still play a3.\n\nSame issue.\n\nBut here\u2019s an idea: **if I move my king to a1**, then after e8=Q, if my pawn is on a4, I can still play a3 \u2014 not stalemate.\n\nBut if I **push a3**, then later a2, then a1, but that leads to queen vs queen.\n\nBut White\u2019s king is far \u2014 maybe **perpetual check**?\n\nUnlikely.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the best chance is **to keep the pawn on a4 and move the king in such a way that after e8=Q, I have no legal moves** \u2014 i.e., **stalemate**.\n\nBut I have a4 pawn \u2014 I can always play a3.\n\nUnless the pawn is blocked.\n\nBut it's not.\n\nUnless I **capture it myself** \u2014 but I can't.\n\nSo stalemate is impossible as long as I have the a4 pawn and it can move.\n\nBut what if I **let the pawn be captured**?\n\nNo, that just loses.\n\nWait \u2014 here\u2019s a key insight:\n\nIf I **move my king to c2**, then after e8=Q, I have:\n\n- King on c2, pawn on a4.\n\nI can play a3, so not stalemate.\n\nBut suppose I go to **b2**.\n\nSame.\n\nBut what if I go to **a3**?\n\nKing on a3, pawn on a4 \u2014 then I can still play a3? No \u2014 king on a3, pawn on a4 \u2014 pawn can go to a3? No, occupied.\n\na4 to a3 is possible only if a3 is empty.\n\nSo if king is on a3, pawn on a4 \u2014 pawn cannot move to a3.\n\nSo **a3 square is blocked by king**.\n\nSo if king is on a3, pawn on a4 \u2014 **the pawn cannot move**.\n\nThen, if I have no other moves, and I'm not in check, it's stalemate.\n\nAh! That\u2019s the key.\n\nSo if I can get into a position where:\n\n- My king is on a3\n- My pawn is on a4\n- And I have no legal moves\n- And I'm not in check\n\nThen it's stalemate.\n\nSo after White plays e8=Q, if I am already in a position where I have no legal moves, it's a draw.\n\nSo can I arrange that?\n\nLet\u2019s see.\n\nSuppose I play **Ka3** now.\n\nCurrent position: Black to move.\n\nI play **Ka3**.\n\nNow, position: king on a3, pawn on a4, White to move.\n\nWhite plays **e8=Q**.\n\nNow, what are my legal moves?\n\n- King: from a3, can go to b3, b2, a2? a3 to b3, b2, a2 \u2014 yes, all possible unless blocked.\n\na3 to b3 \u2014 b3 is empty? Yes.\n\na3 to a2 \u2014 a2 is empty.\n\na3 to b2 \u2014 b2 is empty.\n\nSo I have king moves \u2014 not stalemate.\n\nSo after Ka3, White plays e8=Q, I can play Kb3 or a2 or whatever \u2014 not stalemate.\n\nBut if I could get the king to a2, and the pawn on a4, then:\n\n- King on a2\n- Pawn on a4\n- Can I move?\n\nKing: a2 to a1, b1, b2 \u2014 all possible.\n\nPawn: a4 to a3 \u2014 yes, unless blocked.\n\nSo still moves.\n\nBut suppose I play **Kb2**.\n\nThen after e8=Q, I can play a3 or Kc2 or Ka2 or Kc3 \u2014 still moves.\n\nNo stalemate.\n\nBut what if I play **Kc2**?\n\nSame.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a way to **lose the pawn** or **block it**?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should **push the pawn** to **a3**, then next move a2, racing.\n\nBut after a3, White plays e8=Q, then Qa5 or Qb5+, checking, gaining time.\n\nFor example:\n\n1... a3  \n2. e8=Q a2  \n3. Qb5+ Kc3  \n4. Qa5+ Kc4  \n5. Qb6 Kc3  \n6. Qb3+ Kd4  \n7. Qxa2 \u2014 White wins.\n\nMy king is too far.\n\nBut if I keep my king close, can I protect the pawn?\n\nSuppose I play **Kc3**.\n\nThen after e8=Q, I play a3.\n\nThen White: Qb5,"
