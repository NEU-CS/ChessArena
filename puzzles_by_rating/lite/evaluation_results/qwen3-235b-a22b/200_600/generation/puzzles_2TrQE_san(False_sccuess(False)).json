The b5 pawn is already advanced, and the a6 pawn is on the 6th rank.\n- However, the **b5 pawn is blocked by nothing**, but the **a6 pawn is not yet on an open file**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 the **b5 pawn is on b5**, and the **Black king is on b4**, so it's supporting the b-pawn.\n\nWhite king is on g5 \u2014 far away on the kingside.\n\n### Key idea:\nBlack must **push the pawns on the queenside** and **try to queen one of them**, while the White king is far away.\n\nBut we must be cautious: if Black pushes a6-a5 too early, it might create a weakness or allow White to gain time.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the **legal moves**:\n\n1. `b4c5` \u2014 King to c5\n2. `b4a5` \u2014 King to a5\n3. `b4c4` \u2014 King to c4\n4. `b4a4` \u2014 King to a4\n5. `b4c3` \u2014 King to c3\n6. `b4b3` \u2014 King to b3\n7. `b4a3` \u2014 King to a3\n8. `a6a5` \u2014 Pawn a6-a5\n\nWe must decide which is best.\n\n---\n\n### Let's analyze each candidate:\n\n#### 1. `a6a5` \u2014 pushing the a-pawn\n- This creates a protected passer? No \u2014 after a6-a5, the b5 pawn is still on b5, so now we have pawns on a5 and b5 \u2014 connected passed pawns!\n- That\u2019s **very strong**.\n- After a6-a5, the pawns are on a5 and b5 \u2014 both passed and connected.\n- The White king is on g5 \u2014 very far away.\n- Can the White king stop both?\n  - Distance from g5 to a5: g5 \u2192 f5 \u2192 e5 \u2192 d5 \u2192 c5 \u2192 b5 \u2192 a5: 6 moves.\n  - Black can now push b5-b4, a5-a4, etc.\n  - With connected passed pawns, they can advance together.\n\nBut if Black plays `a6a5`, then White plays `Kg5-f6`, then `Kf7`, `Ke8`, `Kd8`, etc., heading to queenside.\n\nBut Black can just push the pawns.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n1. ... a6-a5  \n2. Kf6 b5-b4  \n3. Ke7 Kc4  \n4. Kd7 Kd4  \n5. Kc7 Ke4  \n6. Kb7 Kf4  \n7. Kxa7 Kg4  \n8. Kb6 Kxh4  \n9. Kc5 Kg4 \u2014 Black will queen the b-pawn soon.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after 1... a5, 2. Kf6 b4, 3. Ke7, Black can play b4-b3, and the b-pawn is very fast.\n\nAlternatively, after 1... a5, the pawns are connected, and White king is too far.\n\nBut is `a6a5` safe?\n\nWait \u2014 after `a6a5`, the a5 pawn is on a5, b5 on b5 \u2014 both passed.\n\nBut the **Black king is on b4**, so it can support the b-pawn.\n\nBut if we play `a6a5`, we lose the option to support the b-pawn with the king on b4? No \u2014 king is still on b4.\n\nBut now, the a5 pawn is not protected \u2014 if White ever captures on a5, but White has no way to do that.\n\nSo `a6a5` creates **two connected passed pawns** \u2014 a very strong asset.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider king moves.\n\n#### King moves: `b4c5`, `b4a5`, `b4c4`, etc.\n\n- `b4c5`: centralizes the king, supports b5 pawn and prepares to support a5 push.\n- But after `b4c5`, White plays `Kg5-f6`, and the race begins.\n\nBut if we play `b4c5`, we haven\u2019t pushed the pawn yet \u2014 White gains a tempo.\n\nCompare:\n\n- **Option A**: `a6a5` \u2014 immediately create connected passed pawns.\n- **Option B**: `b4c5` \u2014 prepare to support, but delay the push.\n\nWhich is faster?\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n\n**Line 1: 1... a6a5**\n\nNow pawns on a5 and b5.\n\nWhite must respond.\n\n2. Kg5-f6 (best, trying to race)\n\n2... b5-b4  \n3. Ke7 Kc4  \n4. Kd7 Kd4  \n5. Kc7 Ke4  \n6. Kb7 Kf4  \n7. Kxa7 Kg4  \n8. Kb6 Kxh4  \n9. Kc5 b3  \n10. Kd6 b2  \n11. Ke7 b1=Q \u2014 Black queens first.\n\nWhite may try to queen too, but h-pawn is only on h4.\n\nAfter ...Kxh4, White has no pawn.\n\nSo Black wins.\n\n**Line 2: 1... b4c5**\n\nNow king to c5.\n\n2. Kg5-f6 b5-b4?  \nBut now the a6 pawn is still on a6 \u2014 not a passed pawn.\n\nWhite can play Kf7, and the b-pawn is isolated.\n\nBetter: after 1... Kc5, next move a6-a5.\n\nBut that takes an extra move.\n\nSo by playing `a6a5` immediately, Black gains a tempo.\n\nHence, **`a6a5` is better** \u2014 it creates immediate threats.\n\nBut is there a danger?\n\nAfter `a6a5`, can White play something like Kf5, Ke5, etc.?\n\nBut still, the connected passed pawns on a5 and b5 are very strong.\n\nAnother idea: if Black plays `b4a5`, king to a5.\n\nThen:\n\n1... b4a5  \n2. Kg5-f6 b5-b4  \n3. Ke7 Kxa6  \n4. Kd7 Kb5  \n5. Kc7 a6 \u2014 but now the a-pawn is back on a6, and Black king is on b5.\n\nBut this is slower than just pushing a6-a5.\n\nMoreover, after 1... b4a5, White can play Kf5, and race.\n\nBut again, the pawn push is more direct.\n\nNow, what about `b4c4`? King to c4 \u2014 supports b5, prepares b5-b4.\n\nBut again, delays the pawn push.\n\nThe key idea is: **create connected passed pawns as soon as possible**.\n\nThat happens only after `a6a5`.\n\nCurrently, b5 is passed, a6 is not.\n\nAfter `a6a5`, both are passed and connected \u2014 a major advantage.\n\nTherefore, **`a6a5` is the best move** \u2014 it creates immediate winning chances.\n\nIs there any refutation?\n\nSuppose:\n\n1... a6a5  \n2. Kg5-f5\n\nNow White threatens to race to a7 or something.\n\nBut Black plays: 2... b5-b4\n\nNow pawns are on a5 and b4 \u2014 still passed, but not connected.\n\nBut king can come to c4.\n\n3. Kf4 Kc4  \n4. Ke4 Kd4  \n5. Kd3 Ke5 \u2014 king heads to support.\n\nBut better: after 2... b4, White can\u2019t stop both.\n\nAlternatively, after 1... a5, even if White plays Kf6, Black plays b4, and the b-pawn advances fast.\n\nThe critical point: **the a6-a5 push gains a tempo** compared to moving the king first.\n\nAlso, note that if Black delays with king moves, White might gain time.\n\nBut with `a6a5`, Black seizes the initiative.\n\nAnother legal move: `b4a4` \u2014 king to a4.\n\nThat supports the b5 pawn and threatens to capture on a5 if needed.\n\nBut again, doesn\u2019t push the pawn.\n\nAnd after `b4a4`, White plays Kf6, and Black still needs to play a6-a5 later.\n\nSo again, losing a tempo.\n\nHence, **the most direct and strongest move is `"

The key factors:\n- Black king is closer to the action.\n- White has a pawn on h5, one step from queening (h6, h7, h8=Q).\n- But White just played h4-h5, so h5 is advanced.\n- Black has a pawn on a5, with a4 possible.\n\nCurrent pawn structure:\n- Black: a5\n- White: h5\n\nWhite king is on g5 \u2014 very close to supporting the h5-pawn to promote.\n\nBut Black can try to prevent that by advancing the king or using the a-pawn as a distraction.\n\nLet\u2019s assess the key ideas:\n\n1. **White\u2019s threat**: h5-h6, then h6-h7, h7-h8=Q. With king on g5, it's close to supporting the pawn.\n\n2. **Black\u2019s counterplay**: The a-pawn is far away, but if it can promote, it might draw or even win if White\u2019s king is too far.\n\nBut White\u2019s king is on g5 \u2014 very far from the queenside. So Black\u2019s best chance is to push the a-pawn and create a passed pawn on the opposite wing.\n\nHowever, Black must be careful: if Black pushes the pawn, the king might be too slow to stop h7-h8.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position more precisely.\n\nCurrent FEN: `8/8/8/pp4KP/1k6/8/8/8 b - - 0 44`\n\nBlack to move.\n\nBlack king on b4.\n\nWhite king on g5, pawn on h5.\n\nBlack pawns: a5, b5 (wait \u2014 b5? No \u2014 pawns on a5 and b5? Wait \u2014 FEN says: `8/8/8/pp4KP/1k6/8/8/8`\n\nSo 4th rank: 1k6 \u2192 king on b4\n\n5th rank: pp4KP \u2192 pawns on a5 and b5? Wait \u2014 no:\n\nFEN: `8/8/8/pp4KP/1k6/8/8/8`\n\nBreakdown:\n\n- 8 \u2192 8th rank: empty\n- 8 \u2192 7th: empty\n- 8 \u2192 6th: empty\n- pp4KP \u2192 5th rank: p, p, 4 empty, K, P \u2192 so a5, b5, f4 empty? Wait \u2014 no:\n\nWait \u2014 FEN notation reads from rank 8 down to 1.\n\nSo:\n\n- Rank 8: 8 \u2192 empty\n- Rank 7: 8 \u2192 empty\n- Rank 6: 8 \u2192 empty\n- Rank 5: pp4KP \u2192 so: a5=p, b5=p, c5=empty, d5=empty, e5=empty, f5=empty, g5=K, h5=P\n\nWait \u2014 that can't be \u2014 g5 is occupied by White king, h5 by White pawn.\n\nBut Black pawns on a5 and b5?\n\nBut earlier move history says: a6a5, h4h5\n\nSo Black played a6-a5, meaning a6 \u2192 a5.\n\nBut what about b5? Was there a pawn on b6? Not mentioned.\n\nFEN says \"pp\" on 5th rank \u2014 so a5 and b5 are Black pawns.\n\nBut only a6a5 was played \u2014 so b5 must have been there earlier.\n\nSo current: Black pawns on a5 and b5, king on b4.\n\nWhite king on g5, pawn on h5.\n\nBut in the legal moves, we have: b4c5, b4c4, b4a4, b4c3, b4b3, b4a3, a5a4\n\nSo king moves and a5-a4.\n\nNo b5-b4? That would be a pawn move, but not listed.\n\nLegal moves are only: king moves from b4 and a5-a4.\n\nSo why isn't b5-b4 a legal move?\n\nBecause it's Black to move, and pawns can move forward.\n\nb5-b4 should be possible \u2014 unless it's blocked.\n\nBut c4 is empty? b4 is occupied by king? No \u2014 king is on b4, so b5-b4 is not possible because b4 is occupied.\n\nAh! Yes \u2014 the Black king is on b4, so the b5 pawn cannot advance to b4 \u2014 square is occupied.\n\nHence, only pawn move available is a5-a4.\n\nSo legal moves:\n- King: b4-c5, b4-c4, b4-a4, b4-c3, b4-b3, b4-a3\n- Pawn: a5-a4\n\nNow, goal: Black needs to prevent White from queening the h-pawn.\n\nWhite\u2019s plan: h5-h6, h6-h7, h7-h8=Q.\n\nWhite king on g5 supports h6 and h7.\n\nBut if Black can create a passed pawn on the queenside, and if it can queen, then even if White queens, it might be a draw or win.\n\nBut timing is critical.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate:\n\nIf Black does nothing, White plays h6, then h7, then h8=Q.\n\nBut Black can try to race.\n\nBut Black\u2019s king is on b4 \u2014 far from h-file.\n\nAlternatively, Black can try to blockade or distract.\n\nBest chance: push the a-pawn.\n\na5-a4 is possible.\n\nBut after a5-a4, White plays h6.\n\nThen Black has to decide.\n\nBut let\u2019s see if king can help stop the h-pawn.\n\nFrom b4, king to c5, d6, e7, f7 \u2014 but that\u2019s too slow.\n\nEven if king goes b4-c4-d5-e6-f7-g8, it takes many moves.\n\nMeanwhile, h5-h6-h7-h8=Q in 3 moves.\n\nWhite to move after Black.\n\nSo after Black moves, White plays h5-h6.\n\nThen Black must respond.\n\nSo let\u2019s simulate:\n\nSuppose Black plays a5-a4 \u2014 trying to create a passed pawn.\n\nThen White: h5-h6\n\nNow Black: if a4-a3, then h6-h7, a3-a2, h7-h8=Q, a2-a1=Q, then Qh8 checks, but White might win the race.\n\nBut White queens first, then can check or attack.\n\nBut Black queens one move later \u2014 so it\u2019s a race.\n\nAfter h7-h8=Q, Black plays a2-a1=Q, then it\u2019s a queen endgame.\n\nBut White has king on g5, Black king on b4 \u2014 very far.\n\nWhite can check with Qh8+, but Black king has no shelter \u2014 might be checkmated.\n\nBut Black queen on a1 can defend?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAfter:\n\n1. ... a5-a4\n2. h6\n   a4-a3\n3. h7\n   a3-a2\n4. h8=Q\n   a2-a1=Q\n\nNow position: White: Qh8, Kg5; Black: Qa1, Kb4\n\nWhite to move.\n\nWhite can play Qh8-h4+ or Qh8-d8+ etc.\n\nQh8-d8+ Kb4-c3? But Qd8-c7+ or Qd8-a5+ wins the queen or checkmates.\n\nFor example: Qd8-a5+ Kb4-c3, Qa5-a3+ Kc3-d3, Qa3-b3+ Kd3-e2, Qb3-b2+ Ke2-f3, Qb2-c3+ etc \u2014 but Black queen can interfere.\n\nBut actually, White can play Qh8-h6+! \u2014 attacking a1.\n\nQh6 attacks a1 \u2014 so when Black queens, White has Qh8-h6+ immediately.\n\nAfter a2-a1=Q, White plays Qh8-h6+!\n\nNow Black must move king or block.\n\nKing on b4: Qh6+ Kb4-c3? But Qh6-a6+! forks king and queen.\n\nQh6-a6+! \u2014 attacks a1 queen and checks king.\n\nSo Kb4-c3, Qa6-a1+ wins queen.\n\nIf Kb4-b3, Qa6-a1+ wins queen.\n\nIf Kb4-c4, Qa6-a1+ wins queen.\n\nSo Black loses the queen.\n\nHence, after a5-a4, White plays h6, and Black cannot safely queen \u2014 because White queens with check or immediate attack.\n\nThus, a5-a4 is losing.\n\nSo pushing the a-pawn now is bad.\n\nBlack must use the king to stop the h-pawn.\n\nBut king is on b4 \u2014 very far.\n\nCan the king reach in time?\n\nWhite has h5, will play h6, h7, h8=Q.\n\nThree moves.\n\nBlack king needs to get to f7 or g7 to prevent h7-h8.\n\nBut from b4 to f7: b4-c5-d6-e7-f7 \u2014 4 moves.\n\nToo slow.\n\nTo g7: b4-c5-d6-e7-f7-g7 \u2014 5 moves.\n\nEven slower.\n\nSo king cannot stop the pawn directly.\n\nBut perhaps White\u2019s king"
