When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

Rxe8 - This would capture White's queen, but let's see what happens after:\n   - After Rxe8, White plays Rxe8+, then Rf8+ (discovered check from the other rook), and it's checkmate. So this leads to immediate loss.\n\n2. Nf8 - This moves the knight from g6 to f8, blocking the e8 square and protecting the king.\n\nLooking at the position:\n- Black king is on g8\n- White has queen on e8, two rooks on e1 and f1, all aimed at the black king\n- The black rook on d8 is pinned by the white queen (if it moves, Qxg6+ wins)\n- If Black plays Rxe8, then Rxe8+ Rf8 Rxf8# as mentioned above\n- Nf8 gets the knight out of the way and blocks potential mating patterns\n\nNf8 is the only move that doesn't lead to immediate checkmate. It retreats the knight to f8, maintaining the defense and avoiding the catastrophic queen capture.\n\nThe knight on g6 is attacked by nothing, but moving it to f8 is about king safety rather than piece safety.\n\n```\nNf8\n```"
