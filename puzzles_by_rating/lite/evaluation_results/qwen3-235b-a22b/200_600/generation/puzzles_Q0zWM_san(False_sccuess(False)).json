If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully.\n\n**FEN:** `8/8/8/1R3pk1/4p3/4P1P1/6K1/3n4 w - - 0 58`\n\nWe are playing as **White**.\n\n### Material:\n- White: King on g2, Rook on b5, pawn on e3, pawn on g3\n- Black: King on f5, pawn on e4, knight on d1\n\nWait \u2014 knight on d1? That seems odd. Let's double-check:\n\n- d1 is a corner square, and the knight is on d1, which is deep in White's territory. But it's Black's knight.\n\nSo Black has:\n- King on f5\n- Knight on d1\n- Pawn on e4\n\nWhite has:\n- King on g2\n- Rook on b5\n- Pawns on e3 and g3\n\nIt's **White to move**.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Black's knight on d1 is extremely passive** \u2014 it's far from the action and will take several moves to become relevant.\n2. **Black's king is on f5**, trying to support the e4 pawn and possibly advance.\n3. **White's rook on b5** is on an open file but currently not attacking anything directly.\n4. **White's king is on g2**, well-placed to support the kingside pawns and potentially advance.\n5. **The e3 vs e4 pawn structure** is locked in the center.\n6. **White has a passed pawn on g3**, and Black has no pawns on the kingside except the e4 pawn.\n7. **Black's king is exposed**, and White may be able to create a passed pawn on the kingside.\n\nBut the rook is on b5 \u2014 far from the action. We need to bring it into play.\n\n### Goal:\nWhite should aim to:\n- Activate the rook\n- Push the g-pawn to create a passed pawn\n- Use the king to support the advance\n- Prevent the Black king from penetrating\n\nBut let's look at **immediate tactical possibilities**.\n\n### Candidate Moves:\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the legal moves:\n\n- **Rook moves**: b5b8, b5b7, b5b6, b5f5, b5e5, b5d5, b5c5, b5a5, b5b4, b5b3, b5b2, b5b1\n- **King moves**: g2h3, g2h2, g2h1, g2g1, g2f1\n- **g3g4**\n\nWait \u2014 **g3g4+** is a possible pawn push. Let's consider that.\n\n#### Try: **g3g4+**\n\nIf we play **g3g4**, then:\n- The pawn advances to g4\n- Checks the Black king on f5\n- Black must respond: either **f5xg4** or **f5f6** (or f5f4, but f4 is blocked by e4)\n\nAfter **g3g4+**, Black plays **f5xg4**, then **e3e4+** is possible? No \u2014 e3e4 would be a pawn push, but e4 is occupied.\n\nWait \u2014 e4 has a Black pawn. So e3 cannot advance to e4.\n\nBut after **g3g4+**, if **fxg4**, then **e3e4** is not possible.\n\nBut White can play **Kxg4**, centralizing the king.\n\nSo:\n\n1. g3g4+ fxg4\n2. Kxg4\n\nNow White's king is on g4, active, and can support e3-e4 if needed, or march to the queenside.\n\nBut is that the best?\n\nAlternatively, **b5f5+** \u2014 rook to f5, checking the king.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze **b5f5+**:\n\n- Rb5 \u2192 f5+, **attacking the king on f5**\n- Black must move: king cannot go to f6 (no square), f4 is occupied by e4 pawn? No \u2014 e4 is on e4, f4 is empty.\n\nWait \u2014 f4 is empty.\n\nSo after **Rb5-f5+**, Black can play:\n\n- **Kf5-g6** (away)\n- **Kf5-e6**\n- **Kf5-f6**\n- **Kf5-g4**\n- **Kf5-f4**\n\nBut **Kf5-f4** would be into the pawn on e4? No \u2014 f4 is empty.\n\nBut **Rf5** attacks f4, so if Black plays Kf4, it\u2019s still under pressure.\n\nBut more importantly: **after Rb5-f5+, if Black takes the rook with Kf5xf5**, then White plays **g3g4+**, check, and wins the king back with **Kg2-h3** or **Kg2-h2**, but wait:\n\nIf **Rxf5+**, Kxf5, then **g3g4+**, Kf6 (or Kf4), then White has a passed g-pawn and active king.\n\nBut is **Rxf5+** winning material?\n\nWait \u2014 **Rb5xf5+**, if Black takes: **Kf5xf5**, then White has **g3g4+**, and the king must move:\n\n- Kf5-f6 \u2192 then e3-e4 might be possible? No, e4 is occupied.\n\nBut after **Kf5-f6**, White plays **Kg2-f3**, centralizing.\n\nBut more importantly: **after Rxf5 Kxf5 g3g4+**, Black plays **Kf6**, then **Kf3**, and White has a strong king and a g-pawn that can advance.\n\nBut we **sacrificed the rook** for a pawn? No \u2014 we captured a pawn on f5, but Black's pawn was on f5? No \u2014 Black's pawn is on e4, king on f5.\n\nSo **Rb5xf5+** means rook captures **nothing** \u2014 it's a check from b5 to f5, but there's no piece on f5. It's just a check.\n\nSo **Rb5-f5+** is a **check**, not a capture.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Rb5-f5+!\n\nNow Black must move the king.\n\nPossible replies:\n\n- Kf5-g6\n- Kf5-e6\n- Kf5-f6\n- Kf5-g4\n- Kf5-f4\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nIf **Kf5-g6**, then **Rf5-f8!**, threatening mate on f8 or g8? No \u2014 no pawns.\n\nBut more importantly, **Rf8** attacks the back rank, and Black's knight is on d1 \u2014 far away.\n\nBut White can follow up with **g3g4**, creating a passed pawn.\n\nBut better: after **Rf5+**, if **Kg6**, then **Rf8**, and the rook invades.\n\nBut is there a faster win?\n\nWait \u2014 what if after **Rf5+**, Black plays **Kf4**?\n\nThen **Rf5-e5!**, attacking the e4 pawn, and also threatening Re5-e6+ or Re5-g5.\n\nBut e4 pawn falls.\n\nBut let\u2019s see if **Rf5+** leads to a decisive advantage.\n\nBut there\u2019s a **better idea**: **g3g4+** immediately.\n\nTry:\n\n1. g3g4+! Kf5xg4\n2. Kg2-f4\n\nNow White\u2019s king invades to f4, attacking e4 and threatening to support e3-e4.\n\nBut e3-e4 is not possible because e4 is occupied.\n\nBut after **Kf4**, Black must defend e4.\n\nBlack can play **Nc3** or **Ne3**, but knight is on d1 \u2014 it will take many moves.\n\nSo Black is helpless.\n\nAfter:\n\n1. g3g4+ fxg4? No \u2014 f5xg4\n\nThen:\n\n2. Kf4\n\nNow Black cannot stop Kf4-e5, and once Ke5, the e4 pawn falls.\n\nFor example:\n\n2... Ne3 (only way to defend e4? But knight on d1 needs two moves: d1-c3-e4 or d1-e3)\n\nd1-e3 is possible.\n\nSo after:\n\n1. g3g4+ Kxg4\n2. Kf4 Ne3\n3. Ke5\n\nNow if Ne3-c4+? No \u2014 c4 is not attacked.\n\nOr Ne3-f5, but Kxf5.\n\nBut after Ke5, Black loses the e4 pawn:\n\n3... Nc4+? No \u2014 Nc4 not possible.\n\nAfter Ke5, Black has no defense to Kxe4.\n\nSo:\n\n3... Kf5 (trying to counter)\n4. Kxe4\n\nNow White is up a pawn, with active king and rook.\n\nBut the knight is still on e3, but White can bring the rook into play.\n\nBut is **g3g4+** safe?\n\nWait \u2014 after **g3g4+ Kxg4**, is **Kf4** legal? Yes.\n\nBut what if Black doesn\u2019t take? After **g3g4+**, Black can play **Kf6** instead of Kxg4.\n\nThen:\n\n1. g3g4+"
