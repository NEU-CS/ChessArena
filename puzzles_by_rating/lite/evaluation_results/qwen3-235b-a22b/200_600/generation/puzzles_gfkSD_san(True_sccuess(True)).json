Yes, unless restricted.\n\nBut the prompt says the only legal move is `Rxd8`. That implies that:\n\n- Maybe the f8 rook is pinned? No obvious pin.\n- Or perhaps the king is in check? Let's check.\n\nIs the black king in check?\n\nWhite has:\n- Rook on d8: attacks along the 8th rank \u2014 yes, it attacks e8. So black king is under attack from the rook on d8.\n- Is there any other piece attacking e8? White\u2019s bishop on c4 doesn\u2019t attack e8. Knight on c6 attacks e7 and d8, but not e8. So only the rook on d8 gives check.\n\nSo: Black is in check from the rook on d8.\n\nTherefore, black must respond to the check.\n\nOptions to get out of check:\n\n1. Capture the checking piece: `Rxd8` \u2014 yes, the rook on c8 can capture the rook on d8.\n2. Move the king: Ke7? Is that legal? e7 is attacked by White\u2019s knight on c6? Knight on c6 attacks e7 \u2014 yes. So Ke7 is into check \u2014 illegal.\n   - Ke8 to f8? f8 is empty, but is it attacked? White\u2019s rook on d8 attacks f8 \u2014 yes, along the 8th rank. So after Kf8, king still in check \u2014 illegal.\n   - Ke8 to d8? d8 is attacked by knight on c6? c6 to d8 is a knight move \u2014 yes, knight attacks d8. Also, d8 is occupied by enemy rook anyway.\n   So king cannot move \u2014 all escape squares are either occupied or attacked.\n\n3. Block the check? The check is from d8 to e8 \u2014 along the 8th rank. Can any black piece interpose?\n\nPieces that could potentially block:\n- Rook on f8: moving to e8? But e8 is occupied by king.\n- Bishop on a3: too far, can\u2019t reach e8.\n- Bishop on a2: same.\n- Knight? Black has no knight.\n- Pawn? No pawns can move to e8.\n\nSo no blocking possible.\n\nTherefore, only legal move is to capture the checking rook with the rook on c8: `Rxd8`.\n\nSo `Rxd8` is forced.\n\nAfter `Rxd8`, White will recapture with the knight: `Nxd8`, and likely also attack the bishop on a2 or something, but that\u2019s beyond our move.\n\nOur move is forced.\n\n```\nRxd8\n```"
