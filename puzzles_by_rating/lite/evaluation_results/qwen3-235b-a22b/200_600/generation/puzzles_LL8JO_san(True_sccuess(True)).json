If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

The black king on h8 is in check from the white queen on h7. The king cannot capture the queen if doing so would leave it in check or if the capture is illegal.\n\nBut here, the move `Kxh7` is listed as legal. That implies that the white queen on h7 is undefended.\n\nLet\u2019s check:  \n- Is the queen on h7 protected?  \n  - White\u2019s pieces:  \n    - Knight on e7 \u2014 attacks f5, d5, g6, g8, f8, etc., but not h7.  \n    - Rook on f3 \u2014 attacks along f-file and 3rd rank, not h7.  \n    - Bishop on e2 \u2014 far away, not protecting h7.  \n    - Rook on a1 \u2014 not relevant.  \n    - King on g1 \u2014 not protecting h7.  \n    - Pawns: h2, g2, etc. \u2014 no support.\n\nSo, the queen on h7 is **not protected**. Therefore, the black king can capture it.\n\nAfter `Kxh7`, White has no immediate follow-up, and Black is up a queen for a rook and pawn \u2014 a massive material advantage.\n\nMoreover, Black has two rooks, a queen, and other pieces still in play. Even though the position might have been dangerous due to the check, capturing the queen is safe and winning.\n\nThus, the only legal move \u2014 and a very strong one \u2014 is `Kxh7`.\n\n```\nKxh7\n```"
