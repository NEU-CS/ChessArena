When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position carefully.\n\n**FEN:** `5r2/1pk4p/pR2p1p1/4b3/2r1N3/4B3/P2R1PPP/6K1 w - - 2 32`\n\nWe are playing as **White**.\n\n---\n\n### **Material and Positional Assessment**\n\nWhite has:\n- Rooks on b6 and d2\n- Knight on e4\n- Bishop on e3\n- King on g1\n- Pawns on a2, f2, g2, h2\n\nBlack has:\n- Rooks on f8 and c4\n- Bishop on e5\n- King on c7\n- Pawns on a6, b7, e6, g6, h7\n\nWhite is **up a pawn** (a6 vs a2, but a6 is isolated and potentially weak). Black\u2019s king is exposed on c7, which is a key point.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Tactical Features**\n\n1. **White\u2019s rook on b6 is attacking the b7 pawn**, which is defended only by the black king. If the king moves, b7 falls.\n\n2. **Black\u2019s king on c7 is in the open**, and White may have mating motifs.\n\n3. **White has a knight on e4**, which can jump to d6 with check.\n\n4. **Rook on d2** is semi-passive but can become active on the 7th or 8th rank.\n\n5. **Black\u2019s rook on c4** is attacking the e4 knight and the e3 bishop indirectly.\n\n6. **White\u2019s rook on b6** is under potential attack from the c4 rook if the b-file opens.\n\n---\n\n### **Candidate Moves**\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most forcing and promising options:\n\n---\n\n#### **1. b6b7+??** \u2013 **Blunder!**\nTakes the pawn with check, but **loses the rook** to **Kxb7**. Then **Rc4xe4** wins the knight. White loses material. **Not good.**\n\n#### **2. b6e6?** \u2013 Rook to e6\nAttacking e6 pawn, but **blocks the e4 knight\u2019s path to d6**, and allows ...Rc4xe4. Also, after ...Bxe6, White has nothing. **Risky and ineffective.**\n\n#### **3. b6d6!** \u2013 Strong candidate\nRook moves to d6, **attacking the e6 pawn**, and **defending the e4 knight**. Also, **supports a potential Nd6+**.\n\nBut more importantly: **threatens Rd6-d7+**, winning the black king\u2019s position.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n- After **b6d6**, if **...Kb8**, then **Nd6!** is crushing:\n  - **Nd6** forks king and rook on f8.\n  - Or better: **Rd6-d7+!**, winning the black rook or delivering mate.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s look deeper.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. e4d6!** \u2013 Knight to d6, **with check**\nThis is **very strong**:\n- **Nxd6+!**, forking king and b7 pawn.\n- After **Kc7xd6**, **Rb6xb7+** wins the rook back **with check**, and now:\n  - **Kd6-c5**? Then **Rb7-a7** pins the a6 pawn, and threatens mate on a5 or b5.\n  - Or **Kd6-e7**, then **Rb7xh7**, winning a pawn and threatening h7-h5 or g2-g4-g5.\n\nBut better: after **Nxd6+ Kxd6**, **Rb6xb7+ Kc5**, then **Rb7-a7!**, threatening **Ra7xa6+**, and the black king is in the open.\n\nBut is there something **even stronger**?\n\n---\n\n#### **5. d2d7!** \u2013 Rook to d7\nThis is **extremely strong**:\n- **Rd2-d7!**, attacking the black king directly.\n- Black cannot capture (Rc4xd7?? Bxe5+ wins queen or mates), but let\u2019s see:\n\nAfter **Rd7!**, Black must deal with the threat of **Rd7-d8** or **Rd7-c7+**.\n\nPossible line:\n- **Rd7!**, now:\n  - If **...Kb8**, then **Rb6-b4!**, threatening Rc4, or better: **Nd6!** next.\n  - If **...Rc8**, then **Rb6-b4**, pinning the c-file.\n  - If **...Kc8**, then **Nd6+!** is crushing.\n\nBut even better: **Rd7!** attacks the king and **prevents ...Kd8**, and prepares **Rb6-b4** or **Nd6**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **Rd7** safe?\n\nCan Black play **...Rc4xe4**?\n\nAfter **Rd2-d7**, Black can play **Rc4xe4**, because the knight is pinned to the king? No \u2014 the knight is on e4, king on g1, so **no pin**.\n\nSo **Rc4xe4** is legal.\n\nAfter **Rd7 Rxe4**, **Bxe5** wins back the piece, and now:\n- **Rf8-d8**, **Rd7xd8 Rxd8**, and White is up a pawn, with active rooks.\n\nBut perhaps better to **avoid the exchange** and keep pressure.\n\nBut let\u2019s go back.\n\n---\n\n#### **6. b6b5!** \u2013 Rook moves to b5\nLoses time? Not clear.\n\n---\n\n#### **7. e4g5?** \u2013 Knight to g5\nThreatens nothing directly. Too slow.\n\n---\n\n#### **8. d2d8!** \u2013 Rook to d8\n**Rd2-d8**, attacking the rook on f8.\n\nBut after **Rc4-e4**, White must respond.\n\nNot as strong.\n\n---\n\n#### **Best Move: e4d6!**\n\nLet\u2019s re-express:\n\n**e4d6+!** \u2013 Knight to d6, **check**.\n\n- **Kc7xd6** (forced, otherwise Nd6-b7+ wins rook)\n- **b6b7+!** \u2013 Rook takes b7 with check.\n\nNow:\n- **Kd6-c5** (only move; Kb6? Rb8+ wins)\n\nNow: **b7b5+!** \u2013 **check!**\n\n- **Kc5-d6**? Then **Rb5-b6+**, skewering king and rook.\n\nBut better: **Rb7-a7!**, threatening **Ra7xa6+**, and the black king is exposed.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after **Kc5**, **Rb7-a7!** is crushing:\n- Threatens **Ra7xa6+**, and if **...b6**, then **Ra6+ Kb5**, **Rxa6 Kxa6**, but White has **Rd2-d6+**, winning back the rook.\n\nBut actually, after **Nxd6+ Kxd6 Rxb7+ Kc5**, White plays:\n\n**Rd2-d5+!** \u2013 **check!**\n\n- **Kc5-c4**? Then **Rb7-c7+**, winning the bishop or mating.\n- **Kc5-b4**? **Rb7-b6!**, threatening a6.\n\nBut **Rd5+** is even better.\n\nWait \u2014 **Rd2-d5+!** is a **killing move**:\n\nAfter:\n1. **Nxd6+ Kxd6**\n2. **Rxb7+ Kc5**\n3. **Rd5+!**\n\nNow:\n- **Kc5-c4** \u2192 **Rb7-c7+**, winning the bishop on e5.\n- **Kc5-b4** \u2192 **Rb7-b6**, and **a2-a3** prevents ...Kb3, and White wins.\n\nBut even better: after **Rd5+**, if **Kc5-c4**, then **Rb7-c7!**, attacking the bishop and threatening mate on c5.\n\nYes \u2014 **Rc7** wins the bishop.\n\nSo this line wins material.\n\nBut is **Nxd6+** safe?\n\nAfter **Nxd6+ Kxd6 Rxb7+ Kc5**, Black can play **...Rc4-e4**?\n\nNo \u2014 because **Rd2-d5+** is check, so Black must respond to the check.\n\nSo **Rd5+** comes with tempo.\n\nThus, **e4d6** leads to a winning advantage.\n\n---\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **quicker win**?\n\nWhat about **b6b7+??** \u2014 we already saw it loses the rook.\n\nNo.\n\nWhat about **d2d7!**?\n\nTry:\n**Rd2-d7!**, threatening Rd7-d8 or Rd7-c7.\n\nIf **...Kb8**, then **Nd6!**, and:\n- **exd6?** \u2192 **Rb6-b8+**, winning the rook on f8.\n- **Rc8** \u2192 **Rb6-b4**, and the c4 rook is attacked.\n\nBut after **Rd7**, Black can play **...Rc4"
