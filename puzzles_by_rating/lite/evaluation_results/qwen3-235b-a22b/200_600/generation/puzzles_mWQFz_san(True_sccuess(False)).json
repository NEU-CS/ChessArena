        "content": "I am playing as White. The current position is a king and pawn endgame where White has a pawn on b4 and kings on the board. My king is on b5, and Black's king is on g4, with a black pawn on h5.\n\nThe goal here is to advance the pawn to promotion while preventing Black from capturing it or creating counterplay.\n\nLet me analyze the position carefully:\n\n- White: King on b5, pawn on b4\n- Black: King on g4, pawn on h5\n- It's White to move.\n\nThe key ideas in this type of endgame (king and pawn vs king and pawn) are:\n- Promote the pawn first.\n- Use the king to support the pawn\u2019s advance.\n- Prevent the black king from getting closer to the white pawn or supporting its own pawn.\n\nBlack\u2019s pawn on h5 is far advanced, but it's not yet a serious threat unless the black king supports it. However, the black king is currently on g4, which is close to queening that pawn.\n\nBut White is to move, and White has a critical tempo.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n1. **Kc6**: Moves king toward the center, but away from the b-pawn. Not ideal.\n2. **Kb6**: Supports the b-pawn\u2019s advance. This is a key square \u2014 controlling a6 and c6, and preparing b5.\n3. **Ka6**: Goes to the edge, but might be useful to prevent Black from some tricks, though not immediately clear.\n4. **Kc5**: Centralizing, supports b6 and prepares b5.\n5. **Ka5**: Stays on the same file, not very active.\n6. **Kc4**: Moves toward the center, but allows Black to play ...Kf3 or ...Kf4, advancing.\n7. **Ka4**: Too passive, loses time.\n\nThe key idea for White is to advance the b-pawn as quickly as possible. The move **b5** will come soon, but we must ensure that after b5, Black cannot capture on b5 and then race the king to stop our pawn.\n\nBut we must move the king first.\n\nThe most critical squares for the white king are c5 and b6. From c5, White can support b5 and then b6. From b6, White can push the pawn and control the queening square.\n\nBut we must also consider the black king: ...Kf3, then ...Ke4, etc., could race toward the b-pawn.\n\nSo, we need to gain as much ground as possible.\n\nThe key concept here is **opposition and race**.\n\nLet\u2019s consider **Kc5**:\n\n- After **Kc5**, Black must respond. If Black plays ...Kf4, then White plays b5, and the pawn will queen first.\n- After Kc5, if Black plays ...Kf3, White plays b5, then Kb6, and the pawn queens.\n\nBut let's see: after **1. Kc5 Kf4 2. b5 Ke5 3. Kb6 Kd6 4. Ka7 Kc7**, and the black king might catch the pawn?\n\nWait: b5, then b6, then b7.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n1. Kc5 Kf4  \n2. b5 Ke5  \n3. Kb6 Kd6  \n4. Ka7 Kc7  \n5. b6+ Kc6  \n6. Ka8 Kb5  \n7. b7 Kc6  \n8. b8=Q\n\nWhite queens first and wins.\n\nBut what if after 1. Kc5, Black plays ...h4?\n\nThat\u2019s a problem.\n\nIf 1. Kc5 h4, then Black is trying to queen first.\n\nThen 2. b5 h3  \n3. b6 h2  \n4. b7 h1=Q  \n5. b8=Q\n\nBut now: 5... Qa1+ 6. Ka4 Qa6+ and Black might draw by perpetual?\n\nWait: after 5. b8=Q, Black queens with check? No: h1=Q is not a check.\n\nAfter 5. b8=Q, Black has h1=Q, but no check. Then White can play Qb4+ or something.\n\nBut let\u2019s see:\n\n1. Kc5 h4  \n2. b5 h3  \n3. b6 h2  \n4. b7 h1=Q  \n5. b8=Q\n\nNow Black queens, but White queens first? No: h2-h1=Q happens before b7-b8=Q.\n\nWait: move order:\n\nAfter 3. b6, Black plays h2, then 4. b7 h1=Q, then 5. b8=Q.\n\nSo Black queens first.\n\nThen 5. b8=Q Qa1+  \n6. Ka4 Qa6+  \n7. Kb4 Qb6+  \n8. Ka4 Qa6+ \u2014 draw by repetition?\n\nBut White can avoid it: after 5... Qa1+, play 6. Qa7 instead?\n\n6. Qa7 Qa1+ 7. Kb6 Qb1+ 8. Ka6 Qa1+ 9. Kb7 Qb1+ 10. Ka8 Qa1+ 11. Kb8 Qb2+ 12. Kc8 Qc3+ 13. Kd8 Qd3+ 14. Ke8 Qe3+ 15. Kf8 Qf3+ 16. Kg8 Qg3+ 17. Kh8 Qh3+ 18. Kg8 Qg4+ 19. Kf8 Qf4+ 20. Ke8 Qe4+ 21. Kd8 Qd4+ 22. Kc8 Qc4+ 23. Kb8 Qb4+ 24. Ka7 Qa4+ 25. Kb6 Qb4+ 26. Ka6 Qa4+ 27. Kb7 Qb5+ 28. Kc7 Qc5+ 29. Kd7 Qd5+ 30. Ke7 Qe5+ 31. Kf7 Qf5+ 32. Kg7 Qg5+ 33. Kf7 Qf5+ \u2014 again draw.\n\nSo if Black promotes first, it\u2019s likely a draw.\n\nTherefore, White must prevent Black from playing ...h4.\n\nSo we need to use the king to prevent ...h4.\n\nBut the white king is far away.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a way to stop ...h4?\n\nOnly if we can threaten something faster.\n\nAlternative plan: **Kb6**\n\n1. Kb6 h4  \n2. b5 h3  \n3. b6 h2  \n4. b7 h1=Q  \n5. b8=Q \u2014 same problem.\n\nSame issue.\n\nBut what if we play **Ka6**?\n\n1. Ka6 h4  \n2. b5 h3  \n3. b6 h2  \n4. b7 h1=Q  \n5. b8=Q \u2014 same.\n\nAll king moves allow ...h4.\n\nBut Black doesn\u2019t have to play ...h4 immediately.\n\nIn fact, if Black plays ...Kf4 or ...Kf3, then White can play b5 and the pawn will queen before Black\u2019s.\n\nBut if Black plays ...h4, it\u2019s a race.\n\nBut in the race, Black queens first, and then checks, leading to draw.\n\nSo White must avoid allowing ...h4.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait \u2014 is there a way to gain a tempo?\n\nWhat if we play **Kc4**?\n\n1. Kc4 h4  \n2. b5 h3  \n3. b6 h2  \n4. b7 h1=Q  \n5. b8=Q \u2014 same.\n\nNo.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the key is to play a move that forces the black king to stay, or threatens mate or something.\n\nBut there is no mate.\n\nAnother idea: **Kb6** is critical because it prepares b5 with support.\n\nBut still.\n\nWait \u2014 let's think about the opposition.\n\nActually, the best move is **Kc5**.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause after **Kc5**, if Black plays **...h4**, then **b5**, and now:\n\n- If Black plays ...h3, then b6 h2 b7 h1=Q b8=Q \u2014 Black queens first, but White can avoid perpetual?\n\nBut as we saw, it's likely a draw.\n\nBut if Black does **not** play ...h4, but instead tries to stop the pawn with ...Kf4, then:\n\n1. Kc5 Kf4  \n2. b5 Ke5  \n3. Kb6 Kd6  \n4. Ka7 Kc7  \n5. b6+ Kc6  \n6. Ka8 Kb5  \n7. b7 Kc6  \n8. b8=Q\n\nWhite queens with check or without, and wins.\n\nBut if Black plays ...h4, it's a draw.\n\nSo Black will play ...h4 to draw.\n\nTherefore, White must prevent ...h4.\n\nBut the only way to prevent ...h4 is to threaten something faster.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a zugzwang?\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: **Ka5**\n\n1. Ka5 h4  \n2. b5 h3  \n3. b6 h2  \n4. b7 h1=Q  \n5. b8=Q \u2014 same.\n\n"
