If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

Both sides have full rooks, pawns, etc. No captures have occurred recently.\n- **King Safety:** White\u2019s king is on e1, with castling rights (K). Black\u2019s king is on g8, also relatively safe for now.\n- **Center and Pawn Structure:**\n  - White has a pawn on e5, which is advanced and could be a strength or weakness.\n  - Pawns on e5, f4, e3, f3, c3 \u2014 somewhat fixed structure.\n  - Black has pawns on c6, c7, p7 \u2014 a potential weakness on d6/c5, but not immediately exploitable.\n- **Rooks:**\n  - White\u2019s a1-rook is on an open file, semi-open a-file.\n  - h1-rook is connected, but not active yet.\n  - Black has rooks on a8 and b8 \u2014 both on the a-file, possibly preparing pressure or doubling.\n- **White to move.**\n\n---\n\n### **Candidate Moves and Ideas**\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the most promising options:\n\n#### 1. **e5e6** \u2014 Pushing the e-pawn to e6\n- This would open lines, possibly targeting f7.\n- After e5-e6, if ...f7xe6, then f4-f5 could follow, gaining space.\n- However, after e6, Black can play ...f6!?, blocking, or ...b6, preparing ...Bb7.\n- But more importantly: **after e5-e6, Black plays ...b6!**, preventing any future Bb5 ideas and solidifying c5.\n- Also, e6 might weaken d6 and allow ...c5 break.\n- **Risk:** Overextension. The pawn on e6 could become weak if not supported.\n- **Not urgent.**\n\n#### 2. **f4-f5** \u2014 Advance the f-pawn\n- Gains space, restricts Black.\n- But after f5, e5 is isolated and could become weak.\n- Black can play ...f6, challenging e5.\n- Also, f5 might block our own king\u2019s escape if needed.\n- Premature? Possibly.\n\n#### 3. **e3-e4** \u2014 Central break\n- Solid. Supports e5, gains space.\n- After e4, we have a strong pawn center.\n- But e4 might be met with ...f6, challenging e5 again.\n- Still, e4 looks like a natural and safe move.\n\n#### 4. **Castling: e1g1 (0-0)**\n- King safety is important.\n- We still have castling rights.\n- The kingside is relatively safe.\n- After 0-0, we can connect rooks and prepare for kingside play.\n- **Highly desirable.**\n- No immediate threat from Black to prevent it.\n- Black\u2019s rooks are on a8 and b8 \u2014 queenside pressure possible, but not immediate.\n\n#### 5. **a1a7, a1a6, etc.** \u2014 Rook moves on a-file\n- a1-a7: attacks a7-pawn, but it\u2019s defended by b8-rook.\n- a1-a7? Rb8xa7, Rxa7 \u2014 we win a pawn but trade rooks, which may not be beneficial when we can improve our position first.\n- Similarly, a1-a6 or a1-a5 are slow.\n- Not urgent.\n\n#### 6. **h1g1 or h1f1** \u2014 Rook shuffling\n- h1-g1: prepares Rh8 ideas? Not useful.\n- h1-f1: maybe to support e1 or f3, but passive.\n\n#### 7. **King moves: e1f1, e1d1, e1f2, etc.**\n- King is better centralized or castled.\n- Moving king out of castling without reason is suspicious.\n- No immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Insight**\n\nWe have **castling rights**, and the position is still developing. Our king is in the center, and while there\u2019s no immediate danger, **castling is the most logical and safe move**.\n\nMoreover:\n- It improves king safety.\n- Connects the rooks.\n- Prepares for potential kingside play or defense.\n- It\u2019s a free move \u2014 no tactical refutation.\n\nLet\u2019s check if **0-0 is legal**:\n- King hasn\u2019t moved: yes.\n- h1-rook hasn\u2019t moved: yes.\n- e1-g1: squares e1, f1, g1, h1 \u2014 f1 and g1 are unoccupied.\n- No check, no obstruction, no attack on e1 or f1 or g1.\n- **Yes, castling is legal.**\n\nIs there any reason to delay it?\n- No immediate threat.\n- No forced line.\n- Black cannot punish 0-0.\n\nTherefore, **e1g1** is the best move.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nCastling is the most principled, safe, and improving move. It activates the king\u2019s rook, secures the king, and keeps options open.\n\n```\ne1g1\n```"
