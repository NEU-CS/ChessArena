When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\n"

The only legal move listed is `h1h2`. Let's verify this.\n\n### Position Analysis:\n\n- White king is on h1.\n- Black has a rook on h2, attacking the king \u2014 that means the king is in check.\n- The only way to get out of check is:\n  - Move the king.\n  - Capture the attacking piece.\n  - Block the check.\n\nThe black rook on h2 is delivering check along the h-file. The white king is on h1, so it's being attacked directly.\n\nLet\u2019s assess escape options:\n\n- King moves: h1-g1? Is that safe? Let's see \u2014 but wait, the rook on h2 controls h2, h3, ..., h8. So h1-g1 would be possible only if g1 is not attacked. But we must check if that move is legal \u2014 however, the list of legal moves only includes `h1h2`.\n\nWait \u2014 `h1h2` would be the king capturing the rook on h2. Is that possible?\n\n- The rook is on h2, king on h1. So h1-h2 is a capture of the rook.\n- Is the rook protected? If yes, then capturing it would leave the king exposed to a discovered attack or another piece attacking h2.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the board more clearly.\n\n### Board Setup (from FEN):\n\n```\n8:  -  -  Q  -  -  -  K  -\n7:  -  p  -  -  -  -  h  p\n6:  a  -  -  -  p  -  -  -\n5:  -  -  b  p  R  -  -  -\n4:  P  n  -  -  -  -  -  -\n3:  N  -  -  -  P  P  N  -\n2:  -  P  P  -  -  -  -  r\n1:  R  -  -  Q  -  -  -  K\n\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 correction: the FEN is:\n\n`2rq2k1/1p5p/p3p3/2bpR3/Pn6/N4PN1/1PP3Pr/R2Q3K w - - 0 22`\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the board properly:\n\n**Rank 8:**  -  -  q  r  -  -  k  -\n**Rank 7:**  -  p  -  -  -  -  -  h  p\n**Rank 6:**  a  -  -  -  p  -  -  -\n**Rank 5:**  -  -  b  p  R  -  -  -\n**Rank 4:**  P  n  -  -  -  -  -  -\n**Rank 3:**  N  -  -  -  P  P  N  -\n**Rank 2:**  -  P  P  -  -  -  -  r\n**Rank 1:**  R  -  -  Q  -  -  -  K\n\nWait \u2014 FEN breakdown:\n\n- 8: `2rq2k1` \u2192 2 empty, r, q, 2 empty, k, 1 empty \u2192 `--rq--k-`\n- 7: `1p5p` \u2192 `1p5p` \u2192 `-p----p`\n- 6: `p3p3` \u2192 `p---p---`\n- 5: `2bpR3` \u2192 `--bpR---`\n- 4: `Pn6` \u2192 `Pn------`\n- 3: `N4PN1` \u2192 `N---PN-P`\n- 2: `1PP3Pr` \u2192 `-PP---Pr`\n- 1: `R2Q3K` \u2192 `R--Q---K`\n\nNow correct board:\n\n```\n8:  -  -  r  q  -  -  k  -\n7:  -  p  -  -  -  -  -  p\n6:  p  -  -  -  p  -  -  -\n5:  -  -  b  p  R  -  -  -\n4:  P  n  -  -  -  -  -  -\n3:  N  -  -  -  P  P  N  -\n2:  -  P  P  -  -  -  -  r\n1:  R  -  -  Q  -  -  -  K\n\n    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 FEN says `2rq2k1` \u2014 that's two empty, then r, q, then two empty, k, one empty \u2192 so:\n\n- a8: -\n- b8: -\n- c8: r\n- d8: q\n- e8: -\n- f8: -\n- g8: k\n- h8: -\n\nSo: `--rq--k-` \u2192 yes.\n\nBut in standard notation, the black king is on g8, not h8.\n\nNow, on h2: Black has a rook \u2014 from rank 2: `1PP3Pr` \u2192 a2: -, b2: P, c2: P, d2: -, e2: -, f2: -, g2: -, h2: r\n\nSo Black rook on h2.\n\nWhite king on h1.\n\nSo rook on h2 is attacking the king on h1 \u2014 yes, check.\n\nNow, can the king move?\n\n- h1-g1: is g1 attacked? Let's see.\n\nBut the only legal move given is `h1h2` \u2014 meaning the king captures the rook on h2.\n\nIs that safe?\n\nIs the rook on h2 protected?\n\nLet\u2019s see: what black pieces attack h2?\n\n- The rook itself is on h2.\n- Is any other black piece attacking h2?\n\nLook at:\n\n- Black bishop on c5 (c5: c5 has b \u2014 from `2bpR3` \u2192 c5: b)\n- Bishop on c5: c5 \u2192 diagonal: a3, b4, c5, d6, e7, f8 \u2014 does not hit h2.\n- Other bishop? No.\n- Queen on d8 \u2014 d8 to h2? d8-h4 is diagonal, but h2 is not on that diagonal. d8 to h4 is a8-h1 diagonal? No: d8 to a5 is one diagonal, d8 to h4 is not straight.\n\nd8 to h4: difference of 4 files right, 4 ranks down \u2014 yes, that is a diagonal. h4 is on d8-h4 diagonal.\n\nBut h2 is two squares below h4 \u2014 not on that diagonal.\n\nQueen on d8: can she attack h2? d8 to h2: 4 right, 6 down \u2014 not same number, so not diagonal. Not same file or rank. So no.\n\nBlack knight on b4 \u2014 b4 to h2? No, knight moves in L-shape. b4 to c2, d3, d5, a6, etc. h2 is too far.\n\nSo no black piece attacks h2 except possibly via discovered attack.\n\nBut if the white king captures on h2, is there a discovered check?\n\nFor example, is there a black piece behind the rook on h2 that would now attack the king?\n\nThe rook is on h2, king would go to h2. What is behind on the h-file?\n\n- h3: from FEN rank 3: `N4PN1` \u2192 h3: - (since `N4PN1` \u2192 a3:N, b3:-, c3:-, d3:-, e3:P, f3:N, g3:-, h3: empty? Wait: `N4PN1` \u2192 N, 4 empty, P, N, 1 empty \u2192 so h3: empty.\n\nWait: `N4PN1` \u2192 that's 7 characters: N, 4 spaces, P, N, 1 space \u2192 total 1+4+1+1+1=8? No: N, then 4 empty, then P, then N, then 1 empty \u2192 positions: a3:N, b3-e3: empty (4), f3:P, g3:N, h3: empty? But that's 8 squares: a to h.\n\nWait: `N4PN1` \u2192 N, 4, P, N, 1 \u2192 that's 5 tokens: N, 4 empty, P, N, 1 empty \u2192 total squares: 1+4+1+1+1 = 8.\n\nSo:\n- a3: N\n- b3-d3: empty (3 of 4)\n- e3: empty (4th)\n- f3: P\n- g3: N\n- h3: empty (1)\n\nSo h3 is empty.\n\n"
