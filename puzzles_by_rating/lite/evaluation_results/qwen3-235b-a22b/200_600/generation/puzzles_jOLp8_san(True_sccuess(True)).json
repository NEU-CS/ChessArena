If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

I am playing as White, and the only legal move available is **Kxf1**, meaning the king must capture the rook on f1.\n\nBefore executing the move, let's assess the position:\n\n- Black has just delivered a discovered attack or check (likely via ...Rf1+), forcing the king to capture.\n- After **Kxf1**, Black's queen is on e5, bishop on f4, and there may be threats involving ...Qe1# or ...Qxh2+ depending on the configuration.\n- However, since **Kxf1** is the only legal move listed, it must be played \u2014 all other options are either blocked or lead to immediate loss via checkmate or illegal position.\n\nLet\u2019s verify safety:\n- After **Kxf1**, is the king in check? The black queen is on e5, which does not attack f1 directly. The bishop on f4 does attack g3 and h2 but not f1. So the king is safe after capture.\n- Also, White\u2019s king was on g2 (from Rg2), so Kxf1 is a legal king move (diagonally backward-left).\n\nThus, the only legal and forced move is:\n\n```\nKxf1\n```"
