When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

N . . .     -> a6=R, e6=N\n5:  p . . p . P p .     -> a5=p, d5=p, f5=P, g5=p\n4:  Q . . . e . . P     -> a4=Q, e4=p, h4=P\n3:  . . . n B . . B     -> d3=n, e3=B, h3=B\n2:  1 p . . . . . q     -> b2=p, h2=q\n1:  . R . K . . . .     -> b1=R, d1=K\n     a b c d e f g h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 b2 has a black pawn? But b1 is white rook. That\u2019s possible.\n\nBut b2 is occupied by a **black pawn**, and b1 is white rook. That\u2019s fine.\n\nNow, **Black has a queen on h2**, which is very strong \u2014 it's attacking the white king on d1 along the diagonal, but also pinned? Let's see.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Key Tactical Features**\n\n#### **Black Queen on h2**\n- Attacks along the diagonal h2-d6-a1.\n- Currently **attacking the white king on d1** \u2014 is it check?\n  - h2 to d1 is diagonal: h2-g3-f4-e5-d6-c7-b8? No \u2014 h2 to d1 is not diagonal.\n  - h2 is h2, d1 is d1 \u2014 difference: file h\u2192d = 4 left, rank 2\u21921 = 1 down \u2192 not diagonal.\n  - So **not checking**.\n\nBut h2 queen is **attacking b7, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, g1, f3, e4, d5, c6, b7, a8**?\n\nWait \u2014 from h2:\n- Diagonals: \n  - h2-g3-f4-e5-d6-c7-b8\n  - h2-g1\n- Also, **orthogonal**? No \u2014 queen moves any direction.\n\nWait \u2014 queen can move horizontally and vertically too.\n\nFrom h2:\n- Horizontal: h2-a2 (entire 2nd rank)\n- Vertical: h2-h8\n- Diagonals: h2-g3-f4-e5-d6-c7-b8 and h2-g1\n\nSo queen on h2:\n- Controls **entire 2nd rank**: a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2\n- Controls **h-file**: h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, h8\n- Diagonals: g3, f4, e5, d6, c7, b8 and g1\n\nSo queen is **very active**, especially:\n- **Attacking g1, f2, e3, d4, c5, b6, a7** diagonally (g3, f4, etc.)\n- But **e3 has white bishop**, which is on f4 diagonal? h2-g3-f4 \u2014 so **f4 is attacked**, but e3 is not on that diagonal.\n\nWait: h2 to e3? h2-g3-f4 \u2014 no. h2-g1 \u2014 no. So e3 is not attacked.\n\nBut **g3** is attacked \u2014 and g3 is empty.\n\nAlso, **f4** is attacked \u2014 currently empty.\n\nBut more importantly: **the white king is on d1**, and the queen is on h2.\n\nCan the queen attack d1? Only if on same rank, file, or diagonal.\n\n- Same rank? h2 and d1 \u2014 no, different ranks and files.\n- Diagonal? h2 to d1: delta file = -4, delta rank = -1 \u2192 not same (|df| \u2260 |dr|) \u2192 not diagonal.\n- So **not attacking king directly**.\n\nBut **is there a discovered attack**?\n\nLook at **Black knight on d3** \u2014 it's on d3, near the center.\n\nIt can move to: e5, c5, f4, b4, f2, e1, c1, b2? Wait \u2014 d3 to b2 is L-shape? d3-c1-b2? No \u2014 d3 to b2 is file -2, rank -1 \u2192 yes, that's a knight move.\n\nBut b2 is occupied by black pawn \u2014 so can't go there.\n\nLegal knight moves: d3e5, d3c5, d3f4, d3b4, d3f2, d3e1, d3c1 \u2014 yes, matches list.\n\nNow, **White has a knight on e6**, which is attacking what?\n\ne6 knight:\n- Can go to d8, f8, c5, d4, f4, g5, g7, c7 \u2014 but currently:\n  - Attacks f8, d8 (possible king escape)\n  - Attacks g5 (black pawn)\n  - Attacks f4, d4, c5\n\nBut more importantly: **e6 knight is attacking the black rook on a6?** No \u2014 too far.\n\nWait \u2014 **is the knight on e6 hanging?**\n\nLet\u2019s see: can Black capture on e6?\n\n- Rook on c8: c8-e8? e8 is empty. c8-e6? e6 has white knight. Is c8-e6 a legal rook move? Yes, along rank 8? No \u2014 c8 to e6 is not same rank or file.\n\nc8 is file c, rank 8. e6 is file e, rank 6 \u2014 not same.\n\nRook on a6: a6-e6? Yes \u2014 same rank 6. a6 to e6 is possible \u2014 **a6e6** is in legal moves.\n\nSo **Black can play a6e6**, capturing the knight on e6?\n\nBut is e6 defended?\n\nWhite pieces:\n- Queen on a4 \u2014 can it defend e6? a4 to e6: diagonal? a4-b5-c6-d7-e8? No \u2014 a4 to e6 is file +4, rank +2 \u2192 not diagonal. a4-e4-e6? No, not same file. So **queen does not defend e6**.\n- Bishop on e3 \u2014 e3 to e6? Same file \u2014 yes, e3-e6 is vertical. So **e3 bishop defends e6**.\n\nSo if Black plays a6xe6, White can recapture with Be3xe6.\n\nSo material: Rook takes Knight, Bishop recaptures \u2014 exchange: rook for knight and bishop? No: rook (5) for knight (3) \u2014 Black loses material.\n\na6 is rook, e6 is knight \u2014 so Rxc3? No \u2014 Rxe6, Bxe6 \u2014 so White gains a rook for bishop? No: Black gives rook, gets knight; White gives bishop, gets rook.\n\nSo Black trades rook for knight, White trades bishop for rook \u2014 net: Black loses exchange (rook for minor piece), bad.\n\nSo **not good** to take on e6.\n\nBut maybe there\u2019s a **tactical shot**.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Look for Checks, Captures, Threats**\n\nBlack to move.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **queen on h2** \u2014 it's very strong.\n\nFrom h2, queen:\n- Controls **2nd rank** \u2014 so can attack b1 rook? b1 is on 1st rank \u2014 no.\n- But **b1 rook is on d1's file?** b1 is on b-file, d1 is d-file.\n\nWait \u2014 **White king is on d1**, and **Black queen is on h2** \u2014 not attacking it.\n\nBut **is there a discovered check**?\n\nLook at **knight on d3** \u2014 if it moves, does it uncover a check?\n\nd3 knight: currently blocking what?\n\n- From d3, what is behind it? Along d-file: d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8 \u2014 d5 has black pawn, d6 empty, d"
