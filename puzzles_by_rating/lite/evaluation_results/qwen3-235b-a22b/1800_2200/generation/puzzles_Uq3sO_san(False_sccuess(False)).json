When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Wait \u2014 no: 1kp5 \u2192 so b7 is king, c7 is pawn)\n\nWait: `1kp5` \u2192 one empty, king, pawn, five empty \u2192 so:\n- b7: black king\n- c7: black pawn\n\nSo black king is on b7.\n\n### Key features:\n\n- White has a **rook on f8**, currently on the 8th rank.\n- Black king is on **b7**, exposed on the back rank.\n- White has a **passed pawn on e6**, supported by e3, and potentially dangerous.\n- Black has a rook on a3, attacking the e3 pawn.\n- White has a **knight pawn on b4**, and black has a pawn on a4.\n- The **c-file** is blocked, but c5 and c6 are pawns.\n- White has a **rook lift possibility** with Rf8\u2013f5/f6/f7, etc.\n- But most importantly: **Black king is on b7, and the 8th rank is almost empty behind it.**\n\nWait: **White has a rook on f8** \u2014 can it **invade the 7th or 8th rank**?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **Black\u2019s king safety**: king on b7, surrounded by pawn on c7. The a8 square is empty. Is a8 a potential escape?\n\nBut if White plays **Rf8\u2013a8**, that would attack along the 8th rank.\n\nLet\u2019s check: is **Ra8** possible?\n\nFrom f8 to a8: same rank, so yes \u2014 **f8a8** is a legal move (and it's in the legal moves list).\n\nAfter **Ra8**, the rook attacks the entire 8th rank. Black king is on b7. So **Ra8 attacks b8**, and if the king is on b7, then **Ra8 pins or threatens mate**?\n\nWait: if rook is on a8, and black king is on b7, then **Ra8+** would be check, and black king must move.\n\nBut where can black king go?\n\nFrom b7: a7, a8, b8, c8, c7 \u2014 but:\n- a7: is it attacked? Not directly.\n- a8: occupied by rook\n- b8: attacked by rook on a8\n- c8: open?\n- c7: has black pawn\n\nSo after **Ra8+**, black king must go to **c7** or **a7**.\n\nBut **c7 has a black pawn**, so only **a7** is available.\n\nSo **Ra8+ Kb7-a7**\n\nThen White can play **Rb8!**, threatening mate on a8.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: after **Ra8+ Ka7**, then **Rb8** \u2014 but how? The rook is on a8. To go to b8, it would have to move from a8 to b8 \u2014 but that\u2019s possible next move.\n\nBut we are looking for the best **immediate** move.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a **mating net**?\n\nAlternatively, **e6-e7** is a candidate: pushing the pawn.\n\ne6-e7: if played, then the pawn advances to e7, attacking d8 and f8? No, pawns attack diagonally.\n\ne7 pawn would attack d8 and f8.\n\nCurrently, black king is on b7 \u2014 far away.\n\nBut **e7 could promote soon**.\n\nBut black can play ...d5-d4 to block or complicate.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at **tactical opportunities**.\n\n### Key idea: **Back-rank mate threat**\n\nBlack king is on b7, with pawn on c7, so the **back rank is weak**.\n\nWhite has a rook on f8 \u2014 can it **invade the 7th or 8th rank**?\n\nLet\u2019s consider **Rf8\u2013f7**.\n\nf8f7: rook to f7.\n\nIs that safe? f7 is not attacked by anything \u2014 black has no pieces attacking f7.\n\nAfter **Rf7**, the rook is on the 7th rank, behind black\u2019s king.\n\nBut black king is on b7 \u2014 so **Rf7 attacks along the 7th rank**.\n\nSo **Rf7 attacks b7** \u2014 so **Rf7 is check!**\n\nYes! **Rf8\u2013f7+** is a **check**.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\n**1. Rf7+**\n\nBlack king on b7 is attacked by rook on f7.\n\nWhere can the king go?\n\nFrom b7:\n- a7\n- a8\n- b8\n- c8\n- c7\n\nBut:\n- c7 has black pawn \u2192 blocked\n- b8: is it attacked? Rook on f7 attacks b7, but not b8 \u2014 only along the rank. f7 attacks all of 7th rank \u2014 so **b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7**\n\nSo **b8 is not attacked** \u2014 it\u2019s on 8th rank.\n\nSo king can go to:\n- a7 (7th file, 7th rank) \u2014 attacked by rook? a7 is on 7th rank \u2192 yes, **a7 is on 7th rank**, so **attacked by Rf7**\n- a8: not on 7th rank \u2192 safe\n- b8: 8th rank \u2192 safe\n- c8: 8th rank \u2192 safe\n- c7: occupied by pawn\n\nSo legal king moves: **a8, b8, c8**\n\nSo after **Rf7+**, black king can escape to a8, b8, or c8.\n\nNo immediate mate.\n\nBut now, **White has e6-e7** coming.\n\nAfter Rf7+, say ...Kb7-c8, then **e7** is strong.\n\nBut let\u2019s see if **Ra8** is better.\n\nTry **f8a8** \u2014 rook to a8.\n\nIs this check? a8 is on 8th rank, king is on b7 \u2014 not on 8th rank, so **not check**.\n\nSo **Ra8** is not check.\n\nBlack can respond, for example, ...Kb7-c7 or ...Ra3-a8 to block.\n\nBut if Black plays ...Ra8, then exchange of rooks, which may be bad for White if the pawn endgame is drawn.\n\nBut White has e6-e7 idea.\n\nWait \u2014 is **Ra8** winning?\n\nAfter **Ra8**, Black might play **Ra3-a8** to block the rank.\n\nThen **Ra8xa8**, and now Black has king on b7, White has king on g3, pawns as before.\n\nThen White can push **e6-e7**, and if ...Kc7, then **e8=Q**, and it's a queen vs rook endgame \u2014 but Black has no rook now \u2014 it\u2019s a queen vs king and pawns.\n\nBut Black has pawns: a4, c6, d5, f5, and c7.\n\nBut White has passed pawns too.\n\nBut this seems messy.\n\nBut perhaps **Ra8** allows Black to draw by rook exchange.\n\nSo maybe **not optimal**.\n\nBack to **Rf7+** \u2014 it forces the king to 8th rank, centralizes the rook, and prepares e7.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: after **Rf7+ Kc8**, then **e7** \u2014 now the pawn is on e7, attacking d8 and f8.\n\nBlack must respond.\n\nIf ...Ra3-a8, then **e8=Q+**, and White promotes with check.\n\nAfter **e8=Q+**, Kd7 (only move), then **Qe8-d8+** or **Qe8-c8+**, and White wins the rook or mates.\n\nBut let\u2019s see:\n\n1. Rf7+ Kc8  \n2. e7 Ra8  \n3. e8=Q+ Kd7  \n4. Qe8-d8+ Kc"
