When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\nrn1qr2k/pp4bp/5np1/2p3B1/4p3/2PP3Q/PP1N2PP/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 14\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLet\u2019s first **analyze the position** step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Positional Overview**\n\n- **White to move**\n- **Material**: Roughly equal. No obvious material imbalances.\n- **King safety**: Black king is on h8, somewhat exposed. White king is on e1, still in the center but castling rights exist.\n- **Pieces**:\n  - White has a bishop on g5, queen on h3, knight on d2, rooks on a1 and h1.\n  - Black has bishop on g7, knight on f6, rook on d8, queen on d8, king on h8.\n- **Pawn structure**:\n  - White: pawns on c3, d3, e4 is a possible push, pawns on a2, b2, g2, h2.\n  - Black: pawns on c5, e4 is attacked, pawns on a7, b7, g6, h7.\n- **Tension**:\n  - White\u2019s bishop on g5 is attacking the knight on f6, which is defending the g6 pawn and also part of the kingside structure.\n  - e4 pawn is under pressure \u2014 Black has just played ...e5-e4? Wait \u2014 no: the position has **e4** occupied by a **Black** pawn. So Black has a pawn on e4, which is **attacking d3**.\n\nWait: Let's reconstruct the board from the FEN:\n\n```\nrn1qr2k\npp4bp\n5np1\n2p3B1\n4p3\n2PP3Q\nPP1N2PP\nR3K1NR\n```\n\nSo:\n\n- Black pawn on e4 (4th rank, e-file)\n- White pawn on d3 and c3\n- So e4 pawn is **attacking d3**, which is a White pawn.\n\nSo White\u2019s d3 pawn is under attack.\n\nBut d3 is defended by c3 and possibly c2 pawn? Wait: pawns on c3 and d3, so d3 is defended by c3.\n\nBut e4 is only on e4 \u2014 not e5. So Black has a central pawn on e4, which is quite advanced.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Immediate Threats**\n\n- Black\u2019s pawn on e4 attacks d3. Is d3 defended?\n  - d3 is defended by c3 (pawn) and possibly the knight on d2.\n  - So d3 is **twice defended**, e4 is once attacked \u2014 no immediate threat.\n\n- White\u2019s bishop on g5 is attacking the knight on f6.\n  - If the knight moves, then ...gxh6? No, g5 is occupied by bishop.\n  - But if Bxf6, then Bxf6, and now h7 is weak.\n\nWait \u2014 **Bxh6?** Is that possible?\n\nWait \u2014 **g5-h6** is in the legal moves list.\n\nLet\u2019s look at **g5h6** \u2014 that\u2019s Bxh6.\n\nIs that a capture? Yes \u2014 h6 is occupied by a Black pawn.\n\nSo: **Bxh6** \u2014 is that a good move?\n\nLet\u2019s analyze it.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Candidate Move: g5h6 (Bxh6)**\n\n- **Bxh6**: White sacrifices bishop for a pawn.\n- After **Bxh6**, Black can recapture with **gxh6**.\n- Then the g-file opens, and White has queen on h3 \u2014 now **Qh3** is pointing down the g-file and can go to h5 or h4, maybe even deliver mate?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAfter:\n1. Bxh6 gxh6\n2. Qxh6+ Bh6? (only move, blocking with bishop)\n\nWait \u2014 Black has bishop on g7 \u2014 so after Qxh6+, Black can play **Bh6**, blocking.\n\nThen:\n- 1. Bxh6 gxh6\n- 2. Qxh6+ Bh6\n- 3. Rxh6+? But White doesn\u2019t want to trade queens unless winning.\n\nWait \u2014 after 2...Bh6, White can play **Qh5**, threatening mate on h7.\n\nBut Black can play **Kg7** or **f5** or **Qe7**, etc.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: after 1. Bxh6 gxh6 2. Qxh6+ Bh6 3. Rxh6+ Kxh6\n\nNow king is exposed, but White has traded bishop and rook for two pawns and a bishop? Not good.\n\nAlternatively, after 2. Qh5, trying to keep queen:\n\n- 2... Kg7\n- 3. Rxh6 Bxh6\n- 4. Qxh6+ Kg8\n\nNow White has queen vs rook and bishop \u2014 but Black is up material (rook and bishop for queen), and White has no clear attack.\n\nSo **Bxh6** seems to lose material for insufficient compensation.\n\nSo probably **not** the best.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Candidate Move: g5f6 (Bxf6)**\n\n- Bxf6: White captures knight on f6.\n- Black recaptures: **gxf6** (only legal recapture, since king is on h8 and pawn on g7).\n\nNow:\n- Black has doubled pawns on f7 and f6.\n- But the g7-bishop now has an open diagonal: **g7-a1** diagonal.\n- Also, the h7-pawn is now weak \u2014 only defended by king and maybe rook.\n- White has queen on h3 \u2014 now **Qh3** is pointing at h7!\n\nAfter:\n1. Bxf6 gxf6\n2. Qh6! \u2014 threatening Qxh7#\n\nBlack must respond:\n- **Qe7** or **Rg8** or **f5** or **Kg8**\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n- 2... Qe7 \u2014 blocks diagonal\n- 3. Rxh7+! Kxh7\n- 4. Qh5+ Kg8\n- 5. Qg6+ Kh8\n- 6. Qh6+ Kg8\n- 7. Qg5+ Kh8\n- 8. Qh4+ Kg8\n- 9. Qg4+ Kh8 \u2014 draw? perpetual?\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a better way?\n\nAfter 1. Bxf6 gxf6\n2. Qh6 Qe7\n3. Rxh7+! Kxh7\n4. Qh5+ Kg8\n5. Qg6+ Kh8\n6. Qh6+ Kg8 \u2014 Black can repeat.\n\nBut can White do better?\n\nAfter 3. Rxh7+ Kxh7, can White play **Qxf6+** instead?\n\n- 4. Qxf6+ Kg8\n- Now Black has queen and rook \u2014 can play Qe5+ or something.\n\nBut White has queen and can threaten mate.\n\nBut Black can play **Qe5+**, checking, forcing Qf2 or Kd2, and then defend.\n\nStill messy.\n\nBut the key point: after **Bxf6 gxf6 Qh6**, White is threatening **Qxh7#**, and Black must spend tempo to defend.\n\nAlso, the f6 pawn is weak, and e4 pawn is isolated.\n\nBut more importantly: **after Bxf6, the g7-bishop becomes very strong**, pointing at White\u2019s king.\n\nWhite has king on e1, and after possible exchanges, the long diagonal could be dangerous.\n\nFor example, if White plays Qh6, and Black plays ...f5, then ...Bg7-c3+ might be possible.\n\nSo **Bxf6** opens the diagonal for Black\u2019s bishop \u2014 dangerous.\n\nBut let\u2019s see if there\u2019s a **forced win**.\n\nWait \u2014 what if after **Bxf6 gxf6 Qh6**, Black plays **f5**?\n\nThen:\n- 3. exf5? No, e4 is Black pawn.\n- e4 is Black pawn \u2014 so no exf5.\n\nBlack plays ...f5, blocking the diagonal.\n\nThen Qh6 is just blocked.\n\nSo no immediate mate.\n\nSo Bxf6 gives White attacking chances, but allows counterplay.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a strong candidate.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Candidate Move: h3h7 (Qxh7+)**\n\nIs this possible?\n\nQueen on h3, h7 is occupied by Black pawn.\n\nSo **Qxh7+** is a legal move.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\n1. Qxh7+ Kxh7\n2. Rh1+ Kg8\n3. Rh8# \u2014 **checkmate!**\n\nWait \u2014 is that right?\n\nAfter:\n- 1. Qxh7+ Kxh7\n- 2. Rh1+ \u2014 yes, rook on h1 attacks h7, now h8.\n- 2... Kg8 (only move)\n- 3. Rh8# \u2014 yes! Rook delivers mate.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is the h1 rook **undefended**? No \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nAfter 1. Qxh7+ Kxh7, the"
