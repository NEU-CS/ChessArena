When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Black\u2019s rook on c1 is guarding c2? No \u2014 c1 is occupied by a black rook. So **c2 is a black pawn**, and it's on c2, so it can promote next move if not stopped: **c2-c1=Q** is a real threat.\n3. But it's **White to move**, so White has a chance to prevent that.\n\nWait \u2014 **c2 is occupied by a black pawn**, and **c1 has a black rook**. That means the pawn on c2 cannot move \u2014 it's blocked!\n\nBut let\u2019s double-check:\n\n- c2: black pawn (from FEN: `K1p1R1PP` on rank 2 \u2192 a2=K, b2=empty, c2=p, d2=empty, e2=R, f2=empty, g2=P, h2=P)\n- c1: black rook (`2r5` \u2192 a1=empty, b1=empty, c1=r, rest empty)\n\nSo **c2 has a black pawn**, and **c1 has a black rook** \u2014 so the pawn is **blocked**. It cannot promote unless the rook moves.\n\nBut if Black plays ...Rc1-c2, then ...c2-c1=Q is possible? No \u2014 if rook moves to c2, then pawn on c2 is still there \u2014 no, that doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nWait \u2014 **a pawn cannot jump**. The **c2 pawn is on c2**, and **c1 is occupied by a rook**, so **the pawn cannot move to c1**. Therefore, **promotion is impossible unless the rook moves away**.\n\nSo currently, **the c2 pawn is blocked** and cannot promote.\n\nBut if Black plays ...Rc1-c2, then the pawn on c2 would be **blocked by its own rook**, so still no promotion.\n\nWait \u2014 that doesn\u2019t help.\n\nAlternatively, if Black plays ...Rc1-a1 or ...Rc1-b1, then c1 is free, but the pawn is on c2 \u2014 it could then go c2-c1=Q.\n\nAh! Yes.\n\nSo if Black moves the rook away from c1, then **...c2-c1=Q** is a promotion.\n\nSo **c1 must be guarded** by White to prevent instant queening if Black moves the rook.\n\nCurrently, is c1 guarded?\n\n- White\u2019s pieces:\n  - Rook on e2: controls e2, so along 2nd rank and e-file.\n    - e2 controls c2? e2 to c2 is along the 2nd rank \u2014 yes, e2-d2-c2.\n    - So **e2 rook guards c2**.\n    - But **c1** is one square below c2 \u2014 not on the same file or rank as e2 directly.\n    - Can e2 attack c1? No \u2014 not same rank or file. e2 is on e2, c1 is on c1 \u2014 diagonal? No, rook can't.\n  - Rook on c3: on c3 \u2014 same file as c1 and c2.\n    - So c3 controls c1, c2, c4, etc. \u2014 **yes, c3 rook attacks c1**.\n  - So **c1 is guarded by c3 rook**.\n\nTherefore, if Black moves ...Rc1-c2, then White can play c3xc2, capturing the rook.\n\nIf Black moves ...Rc1-b1 or ...Rc1-a1, then ...c2-c1=Q is met by c3xc1, capturing the queen.\n\nSo **promotion is not immediately possible** \u2014 White can always recapture.\n\nBut if Black plays ...c2-c1=Q, that would be an illegal move because c1 is occupied.\n\nSo **the pawn cannot move** until c1 is empty.\n\nSo the **immediate threat is not promotion**, but **if Black can force the rook away or sacrifice**, it might create a threat.\n\nBut more pressing: **White has a knight on c5**, and **e5 pawn**, and **rooks on c3 and e2**, king on a2.\n\nBlack has a rook on a4, which is attacking the c3 rook? a4-c4-c3? a4 to c3 is not aligned.\n\na4 is on a4, c3 is on c3 \u2014 diagonal? a4-b4-c3? no, not straight.\n\na4 and c3 are not on same rank, file, or diagonal. So no direct attack.\n\nBut **a4 is attacking the a3 pawn?** a4-a3 \u2014 yes, same file. So **a4 attacks a3**.\n\na3 is a White pawn, defended by king on a2? a2-a3 \u2014 yes, adjacent, so king defends a3.\n\nSo a3 is defended.\n\nNow, **White\u2019s c3 rook is on c3**, which is attacked by **a4 rook**? a4 to c3: a4-b4-c4-c3? no \u2014 not same file or rank.\n\na4 is on a4, c3 is on c3 \u2014 different file and rank. So **no, a4 does not attack c3**.\n\nSo c3 rook is safe.\n\nNow, what are the **key threats**?\n\n### Critical idea:\n\n- **Black\u2019s c2 pawn is a long-term threat**, but currently blocked.\n- **White can try"
