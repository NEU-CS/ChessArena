When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n1k5r/ppp4r/3bQ3/1P4p1/8/P3P1N1/5PP1/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 29\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Positional Overview**\n\n- **White is to move.**\n- White has a queen on e6, knight on g3, pawns on a3, b5, e3, f2, g2, h2, rooks on a1 and f1, bishop on c1, king on g1.\n- Black has a rook on h8 and h7, bishop on d6, pawns on a7, b7, c7, g5, king on b8.\n- Black\u2019s king is on b8 \u2014 exposed on the back rank.\n- White\u2019s queen is on e6, **attacking the black king along the 6th rank**, but currently not giving check.\n- The black king is on b8, with limited escape squares.\n- Black\u2019s pieces are somewhat passive: rooks on h-file, bishop on d6, pawns on a7, b7, c7.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Immediate Tactical Opportunities**\n\nWhite\u2019s queen is on e6. Let\u2019s look at **checks and threats**.\n\n#### **Can the queen deliver check?**\n\n- **e6\u2013e8**: Queen to e8 \u2014 **check**! Black king on b8, e8 attacks along the 8th rank.\n  - Is e8 safe? Is it defended?\n  - Currently, no black piece attacks e8.\n  - Black\u2019s pieces:\n    - Rook on h8: can it capture on e8? No, because h8-e8 is horizontal, but blocked by rook on h7.\n    - Rook on h7: blocks the h-file.\n    - Bishop on d6: could it capture on e8? d6\u2013e8 is diagonal, but e8 is light square, d6 is dark square \u2014 bishop on d6 is on a dark square, so cannot go to e8 (light). So no.\n    - So **e6\u2013e8+ is a safe check**.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze **e6e8+**:\n\n- **Qe8+**, king must move.\n  - King on b8, attacked along 8th rank.\n  - Escape squares: a8, c8, b7.\n    - a8: possible.\n    - c8: guarded by bishop on d6? d6\u2013c7 is diagonal, but c8 is one square away \u2014 bishop on d6 attacks c7, b8, e7, etc., but **c8 is not directly attacked**.\n    - b7: pawn on b7, so king cannot go to b7.\n  - So king can go to **a8 or c8**.\n\nBut after **Qe8+**, suppose **Kc8**:\n- Then **Qd8#**? No, because queen is on e8.\n- Can we follow up with **Qd8#**? Only if queen moves to d8, but that\u2019s not checkmate \u2014 king can go back to b8 or c8.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea:\n\nAfter **Qe8+ Kc8**, what about **Qd8#**? No \u2014 d8 is not attacking b8 unless king is on b8.\n\nWait \u2014 **Qe8+ Kc8**, then **Qc6+**? That might win material.\n\nBut let\u2019s look for **immediate mate**.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a **checkmate in one**?\n\nTry **e6c8+**?\n\n- Qc8+: queen to c8, check.\n- Is it check? Yes \u2014 attacks b8.\n- Is it safe? Who can capture on c8?\n  - Black has rook on h8, rook on h7, bishop on d6.\n  - d6\u2013c8: diagonal? d6 to c8 is one square diagonally \u2014 yes, **bishop on d6 can capture on c8**.\n  - So **Qc8+?? Bxc8!** \u2014 and we lose the queen for nothing.\n  - So **e6c8 is bad** \u2014 loses queen.\n\nWhat about **e6g8**?\n\n- Qg8+ \u2014 check on g8.\n- King on b8 \u2014 is it in check from g8? No \u2014 g8 is far away. g8 attacks along 8th rank \u2014 yes, **g8 attacks b8**.\n  - So **Qg8+** is a check.\n  - Can black capture? Rook on h8 is on h8 \u2014 can it capture? h8\u2013g8: yes, **Rhg8 or Rh8xg8**.\n  - So **Qg8+ Rxg8** \u2014 we trade queens, and nothing special happens.\n  - Not good.\n\nSo **e6e8+** seems best so far.\n\nBut let\u2019s go deeper.\n\nAfter **Qe8+**, king has:\n\n- **Kb8\u2013a8**\n- **Kb8\u2013c8**\n\nLet\u2019s suppose **Qe8+ Kc8**\n\nNow, what can we do?\n\n- Queen on e8, king on c8.\n- Can we play **Qe7?** Not check.\n- **Qc6+?** Queen to c6 \u2014 attacks c8.\n  - Is c6 safe? Bishop on d6 \u2014 can it capture on c6? d6\u2013c6 is diagonal \u2014 yes, **Bd6 can capture on c6**.\n  - So **Qc6+ Bxc6**, we lose queen for bishop \u2014 not good.\n\nAlternatively, after **Qe8+ Kc8**, can we play **Qd8+?** Qd8+ Kc7, then we might have something.\n\nBut not forced mate.\n\nWait \u2014 is there a **better check than e6e8**?\n\nWhat about **e6d7+**?\n\n- Qd7+ \u2014 check.\n- King on b8 \u2014 d7 attacks b8? d7 to b8 is diagonal \u2014 yes, light-squared diagonal.\n- So **Qd7+** is check.\n- Can black capture? Bishop on d6 \u2014 d6 to d7 is vertical \u2014 yes, **Bd6 can capture on d7**.\n- So **Qd7+ Bxd7**, we lose queen \u2014 bad.\n\nSimilarly, **e6f7+** \u2014 Qf7+?\n- f7 to b8? f7\u2013b8 is diagonal? f7 is light, b8 is dark \u2014 no, not on same diagonal.\n- f7 attacks along 7th rank and diagonals.\n- f7 attacks g8, e6, g6, e8 \u2014 not b8.\n- So **Qf7 is not check**.\n\nSo only **rank checks** or **diagonal checks** to b8.\n\nQueen on e6 can check on:\n\n- e8 (same file) \u2014 yes, 8th rank\n- c8 (same rank? no \u2014 c8 is not on e-file) \u2014 wait, e6 to c8 is diagonal? e6\u2013c8: e6 to c8 is two left, two up \u2014 yes, diagonal.\n  - e6\u2013c8: e6 (light), c8 (dark) \u2014 different color \u2014 not diagonal.\n  - So **e6\u2013c8 is not diagonal** \u2014 it\u2019s two left, two up \u2014 but that\u2019s only diagonal if same color.\n  - e6 is light square (e-file odd, 6 even \u2192 light), c8 is c (odd), 8 even \u2192 light? Wait:\n    - a1 is dark.\n    - e6: e is 5 (odd), 6 even \u2192 odd+even = odd \u2192 dark? Wait, standard:\n      - a1: dark\n      - b1: light\n      - So color = (file + rank) mod 2\n      - e6: e=5, 6 \u2192 5+6=11 \u2192 odd \u2192 dark\n      - c8: c=3, 8 \u2192 11 \u2192 odd \u2192 dark \u2192 same color.\n      - e6 to c8: delta file = -2, delta rank = +2 \u2192 yes, diagonal.\n      - So **e6\u2013c8 is a legal diagonal move**.\n\nBut as before, **e6c8+?? Bxc8!** \u2014 we lose queen.\n\nSo not good.\n\nBack to **e6e8+**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a **checkmate**?\n\nLook at the position:\n\n- Black king on b8.\n- White has queen on e6, rook on f1, rook on a1, knight on g3, etc.\n- Is there a way to **deliver mate**?\n\nWhat if we play **e6e7**?\n\n- Qe7 \u2014 not check.\n- Attacks d8, f8, e8, d7, f7, etc.\n- But not immediately threatening.\n\nBut **e6e7** attacks d8 \u2014 which is where the black rook is.\n\nBut not forcing.\n\nWait \u2014 what about **b5b6**?\n\n- b5\u2013b6: pawn push.\n- Attacks c7.\n- If c7 is defended? By whom? Black has pawns on a7, b7, c7.\n- b6 attacks c7.\n- If b6xc7, then a7xc7,"
