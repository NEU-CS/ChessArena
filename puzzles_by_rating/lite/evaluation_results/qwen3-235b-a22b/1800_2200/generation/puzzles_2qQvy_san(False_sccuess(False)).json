When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\nr2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Pn3/3Qn3/5N2/PP2BPPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 14\n```\n\nWe are playing as **Black** (since the side to move is indicated by 'b' in the FEN).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Position\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the key features of the position.\n\n**Material:**\n- Black has two knights (e5, e4), queen (d8), rooks (a8, f8), king (g8), pawns.\n- White has knight (f3), queen (d4), bishop (e2), rooks (a1, f1), king (g1), pawns.\n- Material is roughly equal.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Both kings are castled kingside.\n- Central tension: White has a pawn on d5, Black has knights on e5 and e4.\n- White queen on d4 is active, eyeing the center and potentially f2 or h8.\n- Black queen on d8 is somewhat passive but can become active.\n- Open e- and d-files.\n- Black has two central knights, potentially overextended?\n- White has a bishop on e2, not very active yet.\n\n**Threats:**\n- White queen on d4 could potentially threaten f2 if Black\u2019s knight moves, but f2 is defended by the king and rook.\n- Black\u2019s knight on e4 is attacked by nothing currently, but could be kicked or exchanged.\n- The d5 pawn is a strong central pawn, but isolated.\n\n**Black\u2019s Goals:**\n- Challenge the center.\n- Activate pieces.\n- Avoid tactical tricks.\n- Look for counterplay.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Candidate Moves\n\nWe are to choose from the legal moves:\n\n```\ng8h8, f8e8, d8e8, d8c8, d8b8, d8e7, d8d7, d8f6, d8g5, d8h4, a8c8, a8b8, e5d7, e5g6, e5c6, e5g4, e5c4, e5f3, e5d3, e4f6, e4g5, e4c5, e4g3, e4c3, e4f2, e4d2, h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, c7c6, b7b6, a7a6, h7h5, g7g5, f7f5, c7c5, b7b5, a7a5\n```\n\nLet\u2019s categorize and analyze.\n\n---\n\n### A. King moves: `g8h8`\n\n- This is a retreat, but the king is already safe. No immediate threat.\n- Doesn\u2019t improve position.\n- Slightly passive.\n- Not useful unless avoiding a discovered attack \u2014 but none apparent.\n- **Low priority.**\n\n---\n\n### B. Rook moves: `f8e8`, `a8c8`, `a8b8`\n\n- `f8e8`: Connects rooks or prepares ...e6? But e6 would lose a knight.\n  - After ...e6??, dxe6, and White wins a knight.\n  - So ...e6 is bad.\n  - `f8e8` might support ...f5 or ...exd5, but not urgent.\n- `a8c8` or `a8b8`: Rook lift, but no clear target. c-file not open.\n  - Only useful if ...c5 is coming, but c5 is also a candidate.\n  - Premature.\n\n---\n\n### C. Queen moves: `d8e8`, `d8c8`, `d8b8`, `d8e7`, `d8d7`, `d8f6`, `d8g5`, `d8h4`\n\nLet\u2019s analyze these carefully.\n\n- `d8e8`: Queen to e8 \u2014 passive, blocks rook.\n- `d8c8`: awkward, no purpose.\n- `d8b8`: same.\n- `d8d7`: defensive, protects e8 square, but why?\n- `d8e7`: supports knight on e5 or prepares ...f5?\n- `d8f6`: **very interesting** \u2014 attacks f3 knight and threatens check on f2 if knight moves.\n  - But: after `d8f6`, White plays `Qxf6`! because queen on d4 attacks f6.\n  - So `d8f6?? Qxf6` loses the queen.\n  - **Blunder**.\n- `d8g5`: Queen to g5 \u2014 attacks g2, pins knight on e5 if White plays h3? But:\n  - White can play `h4` or `Qe3`, or even `Qxg5` if knight moves.\n  - But if ...Nf3+ first, then ...Qg5+ might be check.\n  - Let\u2019s see: `e5g4` then `g4f2+`? But f2 is defended.\n  - `e5g4` followed by `g4f2+`? King on g1, f2 defended by rook \u2014 so `Nf2+` is met by `Rxf2`, and then `Qg5+` is possible.\n  - But `d8g5` directly? Then `Qxg5 Nxg5`, and knight on e5 is still there.\n  - Not immediately winning.\n- `d8h4`: Queen to h4 \u2014 similar idea, eyeing h2.\n  - But again, can be captured if knight moves.\n  - For example, `d8h4`, then `e5g6` hxg6, `Qxh4` \u2014 White wins queen.\n  - So risky.\n\nSo queen moves: none seem safe or strong except possibly `d8e7` or `d8g5` with preparation.\n\n---\n\n### D. Knight on e5: `e5d7`, `e5g6`, `e5c6`, `e5g4`, `e5c4`, `e5f3`, `e5d3`\n\n- `e5f3+`? But f3 is occupied by White knight.\n  - So `e5f3` is illegal? Wait \u2014 no, it's in the legal moves list.\n  - Is f3 occupied? Yes \u2014 White knight on f3.\n  - So `e5f3` would be a capture.\n  - But is it legal? Let\u2019s check: e5 to f3 \u2014 knight move, yes.\n  - But after `e5f3+`, White plays `Bxf3`, and wins a knight.\n  - Black loses a knight for a pawn \u2014 bad.\n  - Unless there\u2019s a follow-up.\n\nWait: `e5f3+` is a discovered attack? No \u2014 queen is on d8, not aligned.\n\nAfter `e5f3+ Bxf3`, Black has no immediate threat. White is up a knight.\n\nSo **bad**.\n\n- `e5g6`: knight to g6 \u2014 attacks h8, but h8 is empty. Could be preparing ...Nh4 or ...f5.\n  - But after `e5g6`, hxg6, Black opens h-file for White, and weakens own king.\n  - Also, White can play `Qe3` or `Qg4`, attacking.\n  - Risky.\n\n- `e5g4`: knight to g4 \u2014 attacks f2.\n  - f2 is defended by king and rook.\n  - But if Black can double on f2, maybe?\n  - After `e5g4`, White can play `h3`, kicking the knight.\n  - Or `Qe3`, defending f2.\n  - Not immediately dangerous.\n\n- `e5c4`: knight to c4 \u2014 central outpost, eyes b2, d2, e3.\n  - c4 is strong, but can be kicked by b3 or attacked by Bc4.\n  - But b3 hasn't been played.\n  - This could be useful.\n\n- `e5d7`: retreat \u2014 passive.\n- `e5c6`: similar, but less central.\n\nSo `e5c4` looks interesting.\n\n---\n\n### E. Knight on e4: `e4f6`, `e4g5`, `e4c5`, `e4g3`, `e4c3`, `e4f2`, `e4d2`\n\n- `e4f6`: retreats, passive.\n- `e4g5`: knight to g5 \u2014 attacks f3? No. Could go to h3 or f7.\n  - But h3 is defended, f7 is defended.\n  - Might be preparing ...Nh3+ later?\n  - But after `e4g5`, h4, then knight is stuck.\n- `e4c5`: knight to c5 \u2014 strong outpost, eyes b3, d3, e3.\n  - c5 is a great square.\n  - Hard to dislodge.\n  - Could support ...b5 or ...a5 later.\n  - Very solid.\n\n- `e4g3`: knight to g3 \u2014 check?\n  - g3 is adjacent to king on g1 \u2014 yes, `e4g3`"
