When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/1p2P1k1/5pq1/3p3p/5Qp1/r1P3P1/rP4P1/2KRR3 w - - 0 33\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLet\u2019s first **visualize the position** based on the FEN:\n\n```\n8th:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -     (8)\n7th:  -  p  -  -  P  -  k  -     (7)\n6th:  -  -  -  -  -  p  q  -     (6)\n5th:  -  -  -  p  -  -  -  p     (5)\n4th:  -  -  -  -  -  Q  p  -     (4)\n3rd:  -  -  P  -  -  -  P  -     (3)\n2nd:  -  P  -  -  -  -  P  -     (2)\n1st:  -  -  K  R  R  -  -  -     (1)\n\n     a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\n### Material:\n- White: King (c1), Rooks (d1, e1), Queen (f4), pawns on c3, b2, g3, g2, e7\n- Black: King (g7), Queen (f6), pawns on b7, d5, h5, g4, g5, plus rooks on a3 and a2\n\nNote: Black has two rooks doubled on the a-file (a3, a2) \u2014 likely a powerful battery.\n\n### Immediate Observations:\n\n- White has a **passed e-pawn on e7**, one square away from promotion. This is critical.\n- The **White queen on f4** is active, attacking g4 and potentially threatening mate.\n- Black\u2019s king is on **g7**, relatively exposed.\n- Black has a **queen on f6**, which is defending against immediate threats and also eyeing the g3 and h4 squares.\n- There is a **White rook on e1**, **d1**, and king on **c1** \u2014 somewhat passive.\n- Black has **two rooks on the a-file**, possibly aiming at a1 or c1 if they break through.\n- But White has a **chance to promote the e7 pawn** \u2014 that might be decisive.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the **most forcing move**: **e7e8=Q** \u2014 promoting the pawn.\n\nAfter **e7e8=Q**, the position becomes:\n\n- New queen on e8, attacking along the 8th rank and potentially toward g6 or h5.\n- Black\u2019s king is on g7 \u2014 so **Qe8+** would be check.\n\nWait \u2014 is **e7e8=Q+** check?\n\nYes! Because e8 is on the same diagonal as g7? No \u2014 e8 to g7 is two squares down and two right \u2014 that\u2019s a knight move, not a queen line.\n\nQueen on e8 attacks:\n- Horizontally: entire 8th rank\n- Vertically: entire e-file\n- Diagonally: from e8, diagonals go to d7, c6, b5, a4 and f7, g6, h5\n\nSo **e8 to g6** is a diagonal \u2014 g6 is one square diagonally down-right from e8? No:\n\n- e8 \u2192 f7 \u2192 g6 \u2192 h5: yes, so **g6 is two squares diagonally down-right** \u2014 so **g7 is not on the diagonal** from e8.\n\nWait: e8 to g7 is two files right and one rank down \u2014 that\u2019s not a straight line. So **Qe8 does not attack g7**.\n\nSo **e7e8q** is **not check**.\n\nBut let\u2019s see what happens after **e7e8=Q**:\n\n- Black can play ...Qf6-f1+ or ...Ra2-c2+ or even ...Qf6-c6+?\n\nBut more importantly \u2014 can Black **capture the e7 pawn before it promotes**?\n\nNo \u2014 no black piece attacks e7. The pawn is **completely free to promote**.\n\nSo **e7e8=Q** is a legal, non-checking promotion.\n\nBut is it the best?\n\nWait \u2014 is there a **check upon promotion** if we promote to a knight?\n\nTry **e7e8n+** \u2014 knight from e8 to g7 is a knight move: e8 \u2192 g7 is two up, one left? No \u2014 g7 is two files right and one rank down from e8.\n\ne8 to g7: +2 files, -1 rank \u2014 that **is** a knight move.\n\nYes! So **e7e8n+** is a **knight promotion with check**.\n\nThat\u2019s very interesting.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze both:\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move 1: **e7e8q** \u2014 Queen promotion\n\n- White gains a queen.\n- But it\u2019s not check, so Black gets to move.\n- Black can play **Qf6-f1+**, forking the king and rook:\n  - Qf1+ Kc2 (only) then ...Qxe1, winning a rook.\n  - Or if Kd2, then Qf2+ skewers king and rook on e1.\n- Also, ...Ra2-a1+ is possible, leading to Kc2, then ...Qf2+ etc.\n- So after **e7e8q**, Black can win material with **Qf1+**.\n\nSo **queen promotion loses a rook**.\n\nNot good.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move 2: **e7e8n+** \u2014 Knight promotion with check\n\n- Knight on e8 checks the king on g7 via knight jump (e8\u2192g7).\n- Black **must** respond to the check.\n- How can Black get out of check?\n  - King moves: g7-f7, g7-h7, g7-f8, g7-h8\n  - Or capture the knight? But no black piece attacks e8.\n\nSo only king moves.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\nAfter **e7e8n+**, suppose **Kg7-f7**\n\nNow White has:\n- Fresh knight on e8\n- Queen on f4\n- Rooks on d1, e1\n- King on c1\n\nNow White can play **Qf4-f6+**, attacking the queen and forking?\n\nWait \u2014 Qf4-f6+ is check: queen takes on f6 with check?\n\nBlack king is on f7, queen on f6 \u2014 so **Qxf6+** is check.\n\nYes!\n\nSo:\n\n1. e7e8n+ Kf7\n2. Qxf6+! Kxf6\n\nNow Black has no queen, and White has a knight on e8 and rooks.\n\nBut Black still has two rooks and pawns.\n\nBut White is up material: knight and queen for queen \u2014 so effectively a knight up.\n\nBut better: after **Qxf6+**, Black must recapture king, and then White can play **Ne8-d6**, forking the rook on a2 and threatening mate?\n\nWait \u2014 Nd6 attacks a2 (rook), and also threatens mate on f7 or e8?\n\nBut let\u2019s see: after Kxf6, Ne8-d6+? No, knight on e8 to d6 is possible.\n\nNd6 attacks:\n- a2 (rook)\n- c8, b7, b5, c4, e4, f5, f7, e8\n\nf7 is occupied by king \u2014 so **Nd6+** is check!\n\nSo:\n\n1. e7e8n+ Kf7\n2. Qxf6+ Kxf6\n3. Nd6+ Ke7 (only, probably)\n4. Nc4+ or Nb5+, forking, and White wins a rook.\n\nEventually, White wins at least a rook.\n\nBut even better: after **e7e8n+**, if Black plays **Kg7-h7**, then:\n\n- Qf4-f6+ again! Qxf6, then gxf6, and Ne8-f6 (forking rook on a2 and threatening mate on h7 or g8).\n\nVery strong.\n\nSo **e7e8n+** forces loss of Black\u2019s queen and leads to a winning endgame.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is **e7e8n+** even in the legal moves list?\n\nCheck the legal moves:\n\n> e7e8q, e7e8r, e7e8b, e7e8n\n\nYes! **e7e8n** is legal.\n\nSo **knight promotion with check** is possible.\n\nNow, compare to other ideas.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move: **Qf4-h6+**\n\nCheck: Qf4 to h6 \u2014 is that check?\n\nQueen on f4 to h6: same diagonal? f4 to h6 is two up, two right \u2014 yes, diagonal.\n\nKing on g7 \u2014 is it on that diagonal?\n\nf4 \u2192 g5 \u2192 h6 \u2014 no, that\u2019s not toward g7.\n\nf4 to g7 is one up, one right \u2014 yes, that\u2019s a diagonal.\n\nBut h6 is two up, two right \u2014 so **f4 to h6 is not on the same"
