If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Positional Overview**\n\n- **White to move**\n- **Material**: Both sides appear roughly equal in material.\n  - White has: King, Queen (e2), Rooks (a1, f1), Bishop (e3), Knight (f1), pawns.\n  - Black has: King (g8), Queen (c7), Rooks (f8, f5), Bishop (d4), pawns.\n- **King Safety**: White king is on g1, relatively safe. Black king is on g8, also in the corner, but under potential attack.\n- **Center and Pawn Structure**:\n  - White has a strong pawn on e6 (passed pawn, advanced).\n  - Black has pawns on c5, c6, e7, g6, h5, etc.\n  - White has a backward pawn on a4, but it's supported.\n  - Black bishop on d4 is very active, attacking e3 and potentially threatening the queen.\n- **Key Tactical Features**:\n  - White queen on e2, defending e3 bishop and eyeing the kingside.\n  - Black queen on c7, defending e7 and possibly supporting ...f5 or ...Re8.\n  - Black rook on f5 is on an open file, but may be vulnerable.\n  - White has a **passed e6 pawn**, very close to queening \u2014 this is a **critical feature**.\n    - e6 pawn is blocked by nothing and only one square from promotion (e7). But it\u2019s on e6, so it needs to go to e7 then e8.\n    - However, e7 is currently occupied by a black pawn? No \u2014 looking at the FEN: `5rk1/ppq1p3/2p1P1p1/...` \u2014 yes, e7 has a black pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s **decode the FEN** carefully.\n\nFEN: `5rk1/ppq1p3/2p1P1p1/2p2r1p/P1Pb2p1/4B3/1PP1QPP1/R3RNK1 w - - 3 20`\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the board (ranks 8 to 1):\n\n```\nRank 8: 5rk1 \u2192 -- -- -- -- \u265c \u265a -- \u265c\nRank 7: ppq1p3 \u2192 \u265f\ufe0f \u265f\ufe0f \u265b -- \u265f\ufe0f -- -- --\nRank 6: 2p1P1p1 \u2192 -- -- \u265f\ufe0f -- \u2659 -- \u265f\ufe0f --\nRank 5: 2p2r1p \u2192 -- -- \u265f\ufe0f -- -- \u265c -- \u265f\ufe0f\nRank 4: P1Pb2p1 \u2192 \u2659 -- \u2659 \u265d -- -- \u265f\ufe0f --\nRank 3: -- -- -- -- \u2657 -- -- --\nRank 2: -- \u2659 \u2659 -- \u265b \u2656 \u2656 \u2659\nRank 1: \u2656 -- -- -- \u2656 \u2658 \u2654 --\n```\n\nWait \u2014 let's do it properly:\n\nEach rank is separated by `/`.\n\n- **8**: `5rk1` \u2192 5 empty, then Rook, King, 1 empty \u2192 `-- -- -- -- -- \u265c \u265a --`\n- **7**: `ppq1p3` \u2192 \u265f\ufe0f \u265f\ufe0f \u265b -- \u265f\ufe0f -- -- -- \u2192 a7=\u265f\ufe0f, b7=\u265f\ufe0f, c7=\u265b, e7=\u265f\ufe0f\n- **6**: `2p1P1p1` \u2192 -- -- \u265f\ufe0f -- \u2659 -- \u265f\ufe0f -- \u2192 c6=\u265f\ufe0f, e6=\u2659, g6=\u265f\ufe0f\n- **5**: `2p2r1p` \u2192 -- -- \u265f\ufe0f -- -- \u265c -- \u265f\ufe0f \u2192 c5=\u265f\ufe0f, f5=\u265c, h5=\u265f\ufe0f\n- **4**: `P1Pb2p1` \u2192 \u2659 -- \u2659 \u265d -- -- \u265f\ufe0f -- \u2192 a4=\u2659, c4=\u2659, d4=\u265d, g4=\u265f\ufe0f\n- **3**: `4B3` \u2192 -- -- -- -- \u2657 -- -- -- \u2192 e3=\u2657\n- **2**: `1PP1QPP1` \u2192 -- \u2659 \u2659 -- \u265b \u2656 \u2656 \u2659 \u2192 b2=\u2659, c2=\u2659, e2=\u2655, f2=\u2656, g2=\u2656, h2=\u2659\n- **1**: `R3RNK1` \u2192 \u2656 -- -- -- \u2656 \u2658 \u2654 -- \u2192 a1=\u2656, e1=\u2656, f1=\u2658, g1=\u2654\n\nSo corrected board:\n\n```\n  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n8 .  .  .  .  .  \u265c  \u265a  .\n7 \u265f\ufe0f \u265f\ufe0f \u265b .  \u265f\ufe0f .  .  .\n6 .  .  \u265f\ufe0f .  \u2659 .  \u265f\ufe0f .\n5 .  .  \u265f\ufe0f .  .  \u265c .  \u265f\ufe0f\n4 \u2659 .  \u2659 \u265d .  .  \u265f\ufe0f .\n3 .  .  .  .  \u2657 .  .  .\n2 .  \u2659 \u2659 .  \u2655 \u2656 \u2656 \u2659\n1 \u2656 .  .  .  \u2656 \u2658 \u2654 .\n```\n\nNow, let\u2019s assess key points.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Key Tactical Observations**\n\n#### **White\u2019s e6 pawn**\n- e6 pawn is **very advanced**, only two steps from queening (e7, e8).\n- But e7 is occupied by a black pawn. So it's **blocked**.\n- However, if that e7 pawn is captured or moves, e6-e7 becomes possible.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there a way to **remove the e7 pawn**?\n\nBlack\u2019s e7 pawn is on e7. It\u2019s defended by... who?\n\n- e7 pawn: attacked by e6 pawn? No, same color.\n- Defended by: d7? No piece. c7 queen? c7 queen is on c7 \u2014 can it defend e7? c7 to e7 is diagonal \u2014 yes, **c7 queen defends e7**.\n\nSo e7 pawn is defended by black queen on c7.\n\nSo e6-e7 is not possible unless e7 pawn is removed or queen is deflected.\n\nBut perhaps a **sacrifice** can remove the queen or the pawn.\n\n---\n\n#### **Black\u2019s bishop on d4**\n- It\u2019s a strong piece, attacking e3 bishop.\n- e3 bishop is undefended except by queen on e2.\n- So if bishop takes: ...d4xe3, then Qxe3 \u2014 but then queen is pinned? No, not immediately.\n\nBut more importantly: **White can play e3h6?** Wait \u2014 e3 is bishop, h6 is empty? Let's see.\n\ne3 to h6: is that a legal bishop move? e3 to h6 is diagonal: e3-f4-g5-h6 \u2014 yes, that\u2019s a diagonal.\n\nBut h6 is empty. Why would we go there?\n\nWait \u2014 **g6 has a black pawn**, h5 has a black pawn. h6 is behind them.\n\nBut is there a **discovered attack** or **pin**?\n\nAlternatively, **e3g5** \u2014 g5 is empty? Yes. But again, why?\n\nWait \u2014 **Black king is on g8**. Is there a mating net?\n\nLet\u2019s look for **tactical shots**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Candidate Moves Analysis**\n\nLet\u2019s go through the **legal moves** and evaluate:\n\nList of legal moves:\n- e3h6, e3g5, e3f4, e3d4, e3d2, e3c1\n- e2g4, e2f3, e2d3, e2d2, e2d1\n- g1h1, f1g3, f1h2, f1d2\n- e1d1, e1c1, e1b1\n- a1a3, a1a2, a1d1, a1c1, a1b1\n- a4a5\n- g2g3, f2f3, c2c3, b2b3, f2f4, b2b4\n\nLet\u2019s look for **forcing moves**, especially **checks, captures, threats**.\n\n---\n\n#### **I. e3h6?**\n- Bishop from e3 to h6.\n- h6 is behind black\u2019s g6 and h5 pawns \u2014 so it\u2019s not attacking anything directly.\n- But h6 is on the same diagonal as g7 and f8.\n- f8 is black rook, g7 is empty, h6 is empty.\n- After Bxh6, if gxh6, then Rxg7+! \u2014 let\u2019s see:\n  - Bxh6 gxh6\n  - Rxg7+ Kxg7\n "
