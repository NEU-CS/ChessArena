When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "Let's analyze the position step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **FEN:**\n`4rk2/5p1Q/p1q3p1/2p5/2Pbp1P1/1P3P2/P3R1K1/7R w - - 1 35`\n\nThis means:\n- White to move.\n- Black king is on e8, White king on g2.\n- White has a powerful queen on h7, a rook on e2, a rook on h1, pawns on a2, b3, c4, f3, g4, and pawns on other squares.\n- Black has queen on c6, rook on f8, bishop on d4, pawn on e4, pawns on c5, d4, e4, f7, g6, a6, etc.\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the key features.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations:**\n\n#### **White's Position:**\n- Queen on h7 \u2014 very strong, attacking along the 7th rank and pointing at the black king.\n- Rooks on e2 and h1 \u2014 both active, e2 supports the center, h1 is semi-passive but can swing to open files.\n- King on g2 \u2014 safe, near the center of the kingside.\n- Pawns: c4, b3, a2, f3, g4 \u2014 solid, but no immediate breakthrough.\n- e4 is occupied by a black pawn, but white has f3 and c4 \u2014 potential to challenge it.\n\n#### **Black's Position:**\n- King on e8 \u2014 in the center, somewhat exposed.\n- Queen on c6 \u2014 active, attacking e4 and potentially supporting ...f5 or ...d3.\n- Bishop on d4 \u2014 very strong, centralized, forking e2 and b3.\n- Rook on f8 \u2014 passive, but can become active if ...f5 or ...e5 happens.\n- Pawns: c5, d4, e4, f7, g6, a6 \u2014 somewhat solid, but dark-square weaknesses.\n\n---\n\n### **Immediate Tactical Threats:**\n\n1. **White Queen on h7**:\n   - Attacks h8, g8, f7, and g7.\n   - f7 is defended by black pawn on f7.\n   - g8 is empty \u2014 but if queen goes to g8, check? Let's see:\n     - Qh7-g8+?? \u2014 Kg8, but then Qg8 is hanging? No, wait \u2014 Qh7 to g8: is it check?\n     - Black king is on e8. Qg8 would be check \u2014 yes! Because g8 is adjacent to e8 via diagonal? No \u2014 g8 is two files over and same rank? No:\n       - e8 to g8 is two files right, same rank \u2014 not adjacent.\n       - So Qg8 is **not** check.\n     - But Qh7-f7+?? \u2014 f7 is occupied by black pawn. So not possible.\n     - Qh7-g7+?? \u2014 g7 is empty. Is it check? e8 to g7 \u2014 two files right, one up \u2014 not adjacent. So not check.\n     - So **Qh7-h8+** \u2014 h8 is adjacent to e8? No \u2014 h8 is three files away. Not check.\n\n   Wait \u2014 **is any queen move from h7 giving check?**\n   - Only if it attacks e8.\n   - Queen on h7: can it attack e8? h7 to e8 is diagonal? h7-g6-f5-e4 \u2014 no, not diagonal.\n   - h7 to e8 is 3 left, 1 down \u2014 not straight or diagonal. So no.\n\n   So **no check from queen unless it goes to f7 or g7 with support**.\n\n   But wait \u2014 **Qh7xf7+** \u2014 is that possible? f7 has a black pawn. So capture: Qh7xf7+.\n\n   Let's check:\n   - f7 is occupied by black pawn.\n   - After Qxf7+, Black king must move.\n   - Where can king go? e8 to d8, e7, f8.\n   - But f8 has a rook \u2014 so f8 is occupied.\n   - So king can go to d8 or e7.\n\n   But after Qxf7+, if king goes to e7, then Qf7+ forces king to e7, and then Qe7+? No \u2014 queen already on f7.\n\n   But is Qxf7 safe?\n\n   Black can play ...Qc6xh1? Or ...Qc6-f6?\n\n   Let\u2019s analyze **Qh7xf7+**.\n\n   After **1. Qxf7+ Kd8**, then what?\n\n   Or **1... Ke7**, then 2. Qe7#? No \u2014 queen on f7, e7 is adjacent \u2014 but is it checkmate?\n\n   After 1. Qxf7+ Ke7\n\n   Now, queen on f7, black king on e7 \u2014 queen controls e7? No \u2014 it's on f7.\n\n   But can white play Qe7#? Yes \u2014 queen moves from f7 to e7 \u2014 that\u2019s a move.\n\n   So: 1. Qxf7+ Ke7 2. Qe7# \u2014 **checkmate**!\n\n   Is that possible?\n\n   Let\u2019s verify:\n\n   - After 1. Qxf7+, Black plays 1... Ke7\n   - Then 2. Qe7# \u2014 yes, because:\n     - Queen on e7 checks the king on e7? No \u2014 same square? No \u2014 queen moves to e7, king is on e7 \u2014 that would be capture.\n\n   Wait \u2014 **you cannot move your queen to a square occupied by your own piece** \u2014 but here, king is on e7.\n\n   So **Qe7 is not possible if king is on e7** \u2014 you can't move to a square occupied by your own piece.\n\n   But in this case, after 1... Ke7, the king is on e7, so queen cannot go to e7.\n\n   So **Qe7# is not legal**.\n\n   So 1. Qxf7+ Ke7 \u2014 then what?\n\n   Queen on f7, king on e7 \u2014 queen attacks e7? Yes \u2014 along the rank? f7 to e7 is adjacent \u2014 yes, so **Qf7 already attacks e7**.\n\n   So after 1. Qxf7+ Ke7, the king is in check \u2014 but can it move?\n\n   From e7, king can go to:\n   - d8\n   - d7\n   - e8\n   - f7 (occupied by queen)\n   - f8 (occupied by rook)\n   - f6\n   - e6\n   - d6\n\n   But is e8 attacked?\n\n   Queen on f7 attacks e8? f7 to e8 \u2014 one left, one up \u2014 diagonal \u2014 yes! So e8 is attacked.\n\n   d8? f7 to d8 \u2014 two left, one up \u2014 not diagonal. No.\n\n   d7? f7 to d7 \u2014 two left, same rank \u2014 no.\n\n   e6? f7 to e6 \u2014 one left, one down \u2014 diagonal \u2014 yes.\n\n   f6? f7 to f6 \u2014 same file, down \u2014 yes.\n\n   So king on e7 is attacked by queen on f7.\n\n   Possible escapes:\n   - d8 \u2014 not attacked? f7 to d8: not in line \u2014 no.\n   - d7 \u2014 not attacked.\n   - e8 \u2014 attacked.\n   - f8 \u2014 occupied.\n   - f6 \u2014 attacked.\n   - e6 \u2014 attacked.\n   - f7 \u2014 occupied.\n\n   So only **d8** and **d7** are safe.\n\n   So after 1. Qxf7+ Ke7, king can go to d8 or d7.\n\n   So no mate.\n\n   But what if Black plays 1... Kd8?\n\n   Then 2. Qf8+? Qf8+ \u2014 is that check?\n\n   King on d8 \u2014 Qf8 attacks d8? f8 to d8 \u2014 two left, same rank \u2014 yes, along the 8th rank.\n\n   So 1. Qxf7+ Kd8 2. Qf8+ \u2014 then Black must move king.\n\n   Where? c7, c8, d7, e7, e8.\n\n   But e8 is attacked by queen on f8? f8 to e8 \u2014 one left \u2014 yes.\n\n   d7 \u2014 not attacked.\n\n   c8 \u2014 not attacked.\n\n   c7 \u2014 not attacked.\n\n   So king can go to c8, c7, d7.\n\n   So no mate.\n\n   So **Qxf7+ does not lead to immediate mate**.\n\n   But it wins a pawn and gives strong attack.\n\n   However, is it safe?\n\n   After 1. Qxf7+, Black can play **1... Qc6-f6!**, attacking the queen.\n\n   Because queen is on f7, and f6 is one square down \u2014 so Qf6 attacks f7.\n\n   So 1. Qxf7+ Qf6! \u2014 now white queen is attacked.\n\n   Can white save it?\n\n   - Qf7-e7+? Then Ke7, and queen is still attacked by Qf6? Qf6 to e7 \u2014 yes, diagonal \u2014 so Qe7 is attacked.\n   - Qf7-g7? Then Qf6xg7 \u2014 and black wins queen"
