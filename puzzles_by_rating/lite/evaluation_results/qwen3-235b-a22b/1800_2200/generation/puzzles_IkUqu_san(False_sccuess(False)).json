When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\nr2q1rk1/1pp3pp/p1pbb3/4p3/3QP3/2N3B1/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 0 14\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLet\u2019s first **analyze the position** step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Positional Overview**\n\n**White's pieces:**\n- King on g1\n- Queen on d4\n- Bishop on g3\n- Knight on c3\n- Rooks on e1 and a1\n- Pawns on a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2\n\n**Black's pieces:**\n- King on g8 (castled)\n- Queen on d8\n- Bishops on e6 and d6\n- Rooks on a8 and f8\n- Pawns on a6, b7, c7, p7, e5, g7, h7\n\nWhite has completed development, with both rooks on open or semi-open files, queen active, and king safely castled. Black has also castled and has a somewhat solid position, but there are **tactical possibilities** due to the exposed diagonal from g3 and the central tension.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Key Tactical Features**\n\nLet\u2019s look for **tactics**:\n\n#### **a) Pin on e5-pawn?**\n- White queen on d4, Black pawn on e5.\n- Behind it: Black bishop on d6 and king on g8.\n- But d6 is occupied by a bishop \u2014 not a direct pin.\n\nBut note: **White can play d4xe5**, capturing the pawn.\n\nAfter **d4xe5**, Black can recapture with **Bd6xe5** or **Be6-f5**? Let's see:\n\n- If **d4xe5**, then **Bd6xe5** is possible.\n- But then **Qd4-d6** could attack the rook on f8? Not immediately.\n\nWait \u2014 better idea:\n\n#### **b) Discovered attack idea with Bg3-e5?**\n- The bishop on g3 is pointing at the black king along the **a7-g1 diagonal**.\n- Currently, the e5 pawn blocks the diagonal.\n- But if we **remove the e5 pawn**, the bishop delivers **discovered check**.\n\nSo consider: **d4xe5** \u2014 then **Bg3-e5+** is a discovered check!\n\nLet\u2019s explore:\n\n1. **d4xe5** \u2014 White captures the e5 pawn.\n   - Black must respond.\n   - Can Black recapture?\n\n   - **Bd6xe5?** \u2014 then **Be5+!** (discovered check from bishop on g3)\n     - King must move: **Kg8-h8** or **Kg8-g8** (already there)\n     - After **Be5+**, king goes to h8.\n     - Now White has **Qd4-h4**, threatening **Qh4-h7#**!\n     - Let\u2019s see: **Qh4**, attacking h7, supported by bishop on e5.\n\n     Is h7 defended?\n\n     - Black has pawns on g7 and h7.\n     - No piece currently defending h7.\n     - So **Qh4** threatens **Qh7#**.\n\n     Can Black stop it?\n\n     - After **1. d4xe5 Bxe5 2. Be5+ Kh8 3. Qh4**, Black is in deep trouble.\n\n     Possible responses:\n     - **3... g6?** \u2014 blocks the bishop, but **4. Qxh7#** anyway? No \u2014 h7 is still defended by g7.\n       - Wait: **Qxh7+**? Kxh7, then **Rh1+**? But no rook on h-file.\n\n     Wait \u2014 better: **3. Qh4**, and **threatens Qh7#**.\n\n     Black can play:\n     - **3... f6** \u2014 to block e5 bishop? But e5 is occupied.\n     - Or **3... Be7** \u2014 but too slow.\n\n     Actually, **3... f6** might be best, but after **4. exf6**, Black recaptures with **gxf6**, and White has **Qh6**, still threatening mate.\n\n     But let\u2019s go back \u2014 is **Bd6xe5** forced?\n\n     What if after **d4xe5**, Black plays **Be6-f5** instead?\n\n     - **1. d4xe5 Bf5**\n       - Now **2. Be5+** still works!\n       - **Kh8**\n       - **3. Qh4** \u2014 again threatening **Qh7#**\n\n     So regardless of which bishop recaptures on e5, **Be5+** and **Qh4** follow.\n\n     So this is a **very strong sequence**.\n\n     Let\u2019s write it:\n\n     1. **d4xe5!**\n        - If **Bd6xe5**, then **2. Be5+ Kh8 3. Qh4** \u2014 **Qh7#** next move unless Black plays **g6**, but then **Qxh7+ Kxh7 4. Rh1+** \u2014 and mate follows.\n\n     But wait \u2014 after **3. Qh4**, Black can play **g6**?\n\n     - **3... g6** \u2014 blocks the h4-e1 diagonal?\n       - But **4. Qxh7+! Kxh7 5. Rh1+ Kg8 6. Rh8#** \u2014 yes! That\u2019s mate.\n\n     So **3... g6 4. Qxh7+ Kxh7 5. Rh1+ Kg8 6. Rh8#**\n\n     Even if Black doesn\u2019t play g6, say **3... f6**, then **4. exf6 gxf6 5. Qh6**, and **Qg7#** or **Qh8+** etc.\n\n     So this is **winning**.\n\n     But wait \u2014 what if after **1. d4xe5**, Black plays **f6** immediately?\n\n     - **1... f6** \u2014 trying to undermine e5.\n       - Then **2. exf6 Bxf6**\n       - Now **3. Be5** \u2014 attacking the bishop and threatening **Qh4** again.\n       - **3... Be7** \u2014 then **4. Qh4** \u2014 same threat: **Qh7#**\n       - **4... g6**, **5. Qxh7+ Kxh7 6. Rh1+ Kg8 7. Rh8#**\n\n     So in all lines, **d4xe5** leads to a forced mate or decisive material gain.\n\n     Therefore, **d4e5** is a **very strong move**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Evaluate Other Candidate Moves**\n\nLet\u2019s check if anything is better.\n\n#### **a) Bg3-e5+?**\n- **g3e5**: Is this legal?\n  - Yes, it's in the legal moves list: `g3e5`\n- But **Be5+** now? Let's see:\n  - **1. Be5+?** \u2014 but e5 is occupied by a black pawn.\n  - So **cannot play Be5+** unless e5 is empty.\n  - So **g3e5** is only possible **after** e5 is cleared.\n  - So **g3e5** now is **illegal**? Wait \u2014 no, the pawn is on e5, so bishop can't go to e5.\n\nWait \u2014 **e5 is occupied by a black pawn**, so **g3e5** is **not possible** unless it's a capture.\n\nBut in UCI notation, **g3e5** would imply moving the bishop to e5, which is **blocked** by the pawn.\n\nBut the legal moves list **includes** `g3e5` \u2014 so perhaps it's a capture?\n\nWait \u2014 in chess, a bishop can't jump over pieces. The g3-bishop moves along the diagonal: g3-f4-e5-d6-c7-b8.\n\n- e5 is occupied by a black pawn \u2014 so **bishop cannot go to e5** because it's blocked.\n- So **g3e5** should **not** be a legal move.\n\nBut it **is** in the legal moves list.\n\nWait \u2014 perhaps the FEN is wrong? Or the legal moves are generated incorrectly?\n\nLet\u2019s double-check the board.\n\nFEN: `r2q1rk1/1pp3pp/p1pbb3/4p3/3QP3/2N3B1/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 0 14`\n\nSo:\n- e5: black pawn (from `/4p3/`)\n- d6: black bishop\n- c7: black pawn\n- b8: black rook\n- a8: black rook\n\nSo the diagonal from g3 to b8: g3-f4-e5-d6-c7-b8\n\n- e5 has a pawn \u2014 so bishop **cannot** jump over it.\n- So **g3e5** is **illegal** \u2014 but it's in the legal moves list.\n\nThis suggests the legal moves list **might be incorrect**, or perhaps I\u2019m missing something.\n\nWait \u2014 is **e5** really occupied?\n\nYes: `/4p3/` means 4 empty, then a black"
