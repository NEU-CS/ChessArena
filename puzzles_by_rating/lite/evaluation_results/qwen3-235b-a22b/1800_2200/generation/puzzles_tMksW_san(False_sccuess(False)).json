If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n2rqr1k1/p4ppp/1pn5/3pP1N1/3P1Q2/7P/P4PP1/1R2R1K1 b - - 5 23\n```\n\nWe are playing as **Black** (since the side to move is indicated by 'b' in the FEN).\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Positional Overview**\n\n**Material:**\n- Black: King on g8, Queen on d8, Rook on c8 and e8, Knight on c6, pawns on a7, b6, d5, f7, g7, h7\n- White: King on g1, Queen on f4, Rook on b1 and e1, Knight on g5, pawns on d4, e5, h3, f2, g2, a2\n\nBlack has a slight material edge: two rooks and a queen vs. two rooks and a queen \u2014 equal. But Black has more active pieces.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- White has a strong knight on g5, eyeing f7 and h7.\n- White queen on f4 is very active, threatening f7 and potentially h6 or g7.\n- Black\u2019s king is on g8, potentially vulnerable to back-rank or mating threats if not careful.\n- Black has a semi-open e-file and c-file.\n- White has a pawn on e5, which is advanced but may be a target.\n- Black has a knight on c6, which is well-placed but potentially under pressure.\n- Black\u2019s queen is on d8, somewhat passive.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Immediate Threats**\n\nLet\u2019s check for **tactical threats**:\n\n- **White\u2019s queen on f4** and **knight on g5** \u2014 is there a threat of Ng5xf7 or Qf4xf7+?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n- **Nxf7?** \u2014 Knight on g5 takes on f7: but f7 is defended by g7 and potentially e8. But after Nxf7, Kxf7, Qxf7+ would be check, but Black can recapture with the king. However, White might not want to trade knight for pawn unless it leads to more.\n\nBut more importantly: **Is Qf4-h6 a threat?** Yes \u2014 if Black doesn\u2019t defend h7, Qh6 could be deadly, especially with Ng5 and potential mate on g7.\n\nFor example:\n- Qh6, then if g6, Nh7+ or something. So **h7 is weak**.\n\nAlso, **e5 is a pawn that might be isolated** \u2014 Black could consider ...dxe5 or ...Nxe5.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at **Black\u2019s legal moves**:\n\n```\ng8h8, g8f8, e8f8, e8e7, e8e6, e8e5, d8e7, d8d7, d8c7, d8f6, d8d6, d8g5, c8b8, c8a8, c8c7, c6b8, c6e7, c6e5, c6d4, c6b4, h7h6, g7g6, f7f6, a7a6, b6b5, h7h5, f7f5, a7a5\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Candidate Moves**\n\nLet\u2019s group them by piece:\n\n#### **King moves:**\n- g8h8 \u2014 king to h8\n- g8f8 \u2014 king to f8\n\nWhy move the king? To avoid back-rank issues or prepare ...Rxe1.\n\nBut is there a back-rank threat? White has queen on f4, rook on e1 \u2014 but no immediate mate. Still, ...Kh8 might be prophylactic.\n\n#### **Rook on e8:**\n- e8f8 \u2014 rook to f8\n- e8e7 \u2014 rook to e7\n- e8e6 \u2014 rook to e6\n- e8e5 \u2014 rook to e5\n\ne8f8 connects rooks and defends f7. e8e5 attacks e5 pawn.\n\n#### **Queen on d8:**\n- d8e7 \u2014 queen to e7\n- d8d7 \u2014 queen to d7\n- d8c7 \u2014 queen to c7\n- d8f6 \u2014 queen to f6 (attacking f4 queen?)\n- d8d6 \u2014 queen to d6\n- d8g5 \u2014 queen takes knight on g5!\n\n**d8g5** \u2014 Queen takes on g5! Is that possible?\n\nLet\u2019s check: Queen from d8 to g5 \u2014 is that a legal diagonal? d8 to g5: d8-c7-b6-a5, no \u2014 that\u2019s not diagonal. d8 to g5 is **not on the same diagonal**.\n\nd8 is light square, g5 is dark square \u2014 so **queen cannot go d8g5** \u2014 it\u2019s not a legal move. But it\u2019s in the list? Wait \u2014 is this a mistake?\n\nWait: d8 to g5 is **three files right, three ranks down** \u2014 that\u2019s a diagonal! d8-e7-f6-g5 \u2014 yes! That **is** a diagonal.\n\nd8 (light), e7 (dark), f6 (light), g5 (dark) \u2014 wait, no: d8 is dark square (d-file, 8th rank: d is 4th file \u2192 even, 8 even \u2192 dark), g5: g is 7th file (odd), 5 odd \u2192 dark. So same color.\n\nd8 to g5: difference of +3 files, -3 ranks \u2192 yes, diagonal. So **d8g5 is legal**.\n\nBut is it safe?\n\n**d8g5** \u2014 Black queen takes White knight on g5.\n\nBut White has queen on f4 \u2014 can it recapture? f4 to g5 \u2014 yes, along the diagonal.\n\nSo after **...Qxg5**, White plays **Qxg5**, and Black loses queen for knight.\n\nIs that good? No \u2014 unless there\u2019s a follow-up.\n\nBut after Qxg5, Black has no immediate mate. So **d8g5?? Qxg5** \u2014 Black loses queen for knight \u2014 terrible.\n\nSo **d8g5 is a blunder** \u2014 avoid.\n\nSimilarly, **d8f6** \u2014 queen to f6: attacks f4 queen? f6-f4 is vertical \u2014 yes, same file.\n\nSo **...Qf6** attacks the white queen on f4.\n\nWhite would have to move or trade queens.\n\nBut after ...Qf6, Qxf6, gxf6 \u2014 Black gets doubled f-pawns, but opens the g-file and may have king safety issues.\n\nBut it removes the queen threat on h6 and f4.\n\nBut let\u2019s see if there\u2019s something better.\n\n#### **Rook on c8:**\n- c8b8, c8a8, c8c7\n\nAll lateral moves \u2014 not very active.\n\n#### **Knight on c6:**\n- c6b8, c6e7, c6e5, c6d4, c6b4\n\nc6e5 \u2014 knight to e5 \u2014 attacks f4 queen? e5-f4 is diagonal? e5 to f4 is one square diagonally \u2014 yes.\n\nSo **...Ne5** attacks the white queen on f4.\n\nThat\u2019s interesting.\n\nWhite queen is on f4, attacked by knight on e5.\n\nIf Black plays ...Ne5, White must move queen or lose it.\n\nThat\u2019s a strong idea.\n\nCompare to ...Qf6 \u2014 also attacks queen.\n\nBut ...Ne5 is a **developed piece move**, not trading queens, and maintains tension.\n\nAlso, knight on e5 is very strong \u2014 central, attacks f4, d3, f7, etc.\n\nBut is e5 defended? e5 is currently occupied by a white pawn.\n\nSo **...Ne5** would be **capturing on e5** \u2014 so **c6e5** means Nc6xe5.\n\nYes \u2014 so Black takes on e5.\n\nIs it defended? White has pawn on d4 \u2014 can recapture dxe5.\n\nBut after **...Nxe5**, dxe5, then Black has opened the e-file for rook, and White no longer has knight on g5.\n\nBut wait \u2014 White still has knight on g5? After ...Nxe5, dxe5, the knight on g5 is still there.\n\nBut Black has removed the e5 pawn, which was supporting d4 and potentially a passed pawn.\n\nBut more importantly: **after ...Nxe5, dxe5, Qf4 is attacked** \u2014 so White must move queen.\n\nBut also: **after ...Nxe5**, is the knight safe?\n\nWhite can play d4-d5? But d5 attacks c6, not e5.\n\nd4-e5 is already done.\n\nAfter ...Nxe5, dxe5, knight is gone.\n\nBut knight is on e5 \u2014 after dxe5, the pawn on e5 is gone, so knight is on e5 with no pawn.\n\nWait: **c6e5** is Nc6 takes e5 \u2014 so Black captures the e5 pawn with knight.\n\nSo after **...Nxe5**, White can recapture with d4xe5.\n\nSo knight is captured.\n\nSo **...Nxe5??"
