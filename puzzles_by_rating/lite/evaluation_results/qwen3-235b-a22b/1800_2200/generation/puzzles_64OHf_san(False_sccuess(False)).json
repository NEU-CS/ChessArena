When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate.

If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Positional Overview**\n\n**White's material:**\n- King on g1\n- Queen on g3\n- Rook on e4 (attacking on e-file)\n- Rook on f1 (connected with king-side rook)\n- Bishop on c4\n- Pawns: a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2\n\n**Black's material:**\n- King on h8 (in the corner, potentially vulnerable)\n- Queen on f8\n- Rook on b8\n- Knight on e4 (wait \u2014 no! e4 is occupied by a white rook!)\nWait \u2014 let's double-check the board.\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the board from the FEN:\n\n```\nFEN: rn3q1k/pp1b2p1/2p1p2p/8/2B1Nr2/6Q1/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 6 17\n```\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n**8th rank (Black back rank):** r n - - - q - k  \u2192 a8=r, b8=n, f8=q, h8=k\n**7th rank:** p p - b - - g - \u2192 a7=p, b7=p, d7=b, g7=p\n**6th rank:** - - p - p - - p \u2192 c6=p, e6=p, h6=p\n**5th rank:** - - - - - - - -\n**4th rank:** - - B - N r - - \u2192 c4=B, e4=N? Wait \u2014 no! e4 is \"N\" \u2014 but it's White's move. So \"N\" is White knight?\n\nWait \u2014 **FEN notation**: uppercase = White, lowercase = Black.\n\nSo:\n\n- e4: \"N\" \u2192 White knight? But we have a rook on e4 in the description?\n\nWait \u2014 let's parse the 4th rank carefully:\n\n**4th rank:** `2B1Nr2` \u2192 two empty, B, one empty, N, r, two empty\n\nSo:\n- c4: B (White bishop)\n- e4: N (White knight)\n- f4: r (Black rook)\n\nAh! So the **White knight is on e4**, and **Black rook is on f4**.\n\nSo earlier assumption was wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the entire board:\n\n```\n8 | r  n  -  -  -  q  -  k |\n7 | p  p  -  b  -  -  p  - |\n6 | -  -  p  -  p  -  -  p |\n5 | -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - |\n4 | -  -  B  -  N  r  -  - |\n3 | -  -  -  -  -  -  Q  - |\n2 | P  P  P  -  -  P  P  P |\n1 | R  -  -  -  R  K  -  - |\n    a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\nWait \u2014 3rd rank: `6Q1` \u2192 six empty, Q, one empty \u2192 so g3 = Q (White queen)\n\n2nd rank: `PPP2PPP` \u2192 P P P _ _ P P P \u2192 so d2 and e2 are empty\n\n1st rank: `R4RK1` \u2192 R, four empty, R, K, one empty \u2192 so a1=R, f1=R, g1=K, h1=empty\n\nSo corrected board:\n\n```\n  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n8 r  n  -  -  -  q  -  k\n7 p  p  -  b  -  -  p  -\n6 -  -  p  -  p  -  -  p\n5 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -\n4 -  -  B  -  N  r  -  -\n3 -  -  -  -  -  -  Q  -\n2 P  P  P  -  -  P  P  P\n1 R  -  -  -  R  K  -  -\n```\n\nNow, **White to move**.\n\nWhite pieces:\n- King: g1\n- Queen: g3\n- Rooks: a1, f1\n- Bishop: c4\n- Knight: e4\n- Pawns: a2, b2, c2, f2, g2, h2\n\nBlack pieces:\n- King: h8\n- Queen: f8\n- Rooks: f4, b8\n- Knight: b8\n- Bishop: d7\n- Pawns: a7, b7, c6, e6, g7, h6\n\n---\n\n### **2. Tactical and Strategic Assessment**\n\n#### **Key Features:**\n\n- **Black king is exposed** on h8, with limited escape. No castling, and pawns on g7, h6. Potential mating net possible.\n- **White has strong central control**: knight on e4, bishop on c4, queen on g3.\n- **Black rook on f4 is deep in White\u2019s territory**, but may be vulnerable.\n- **White queen on g3** is eyeing h3, g6, h7, and also the h-file.\n- **White bishop on c4** targets h7 via the diagonal, but h7 is defended by g7 pawn.\n- **White knight on e4** is strong, attacking d6, f6, c5, g5.\n- **Black\u2019s queen on f8** is passive, not defending h8 well.\n- **White has a rook on f1**, connected with king, but not yet active.\n- **White has a rook on a1**, not active.\n\n#### **Immediate Tactical Ideas:**\n\n1. **Attack on h7**: h7 is a classic weakness. Currently defended by g7 pawn. Can we break it?\n   - Queen on g3 already eyes h7.\n   - If we can remove g7 or deflect the g7 pawn, h7 falls.\n   - Bishop on c4 \u2192 h7 is on the diagonal, but blocked by pawns.\n\n2. **Knight on e4**:\n   - Can jump to f6+? e4f6+?\n     - e4f6+ \u2192 knight takes on f6, check?\n     - f6 is currently empty? Yes \u2014 f6 is empty.\n     - So **e4f6+** is a candidate move.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze **e4f6+**:\n\n- Knight takes on f6, check.\n- Black must respond.\n- After Nxf6, Black can:\n  - gxh6? No \u2014 g7 pawn takes: **g7xf6**.\n  - Then White has **Qg3xh6**, threatening mate on h7 or g7.\n  - Let\u2019s see:\n    - 1. Nxf6 gxf6\n    - 2. Qxh6+ Kg8\n    - Now Qh7+ is mate? Qh7+ Kh8, Qh8#? No \u2014 queen can\u2019t go to h8 if king is on h8.\n    - Qh7+ Kh8, then Qh8# only if no defender \u2014 but rook on f4? No, f4 is black rook, but it can\u2019t block.\n\nWait: after 1. Nxf6 gxf6, 2. Qxh6+ Kg8, 3. Qh7+ Kf8? Or Kf7?\n\nWait \u2014 king on h8, after Qxh6+, king can go to g8.\n\nThen Qh7+ forces Kg8 \u2192 Qh7+ is not checkmate.\n\nBut can we follow up with mate?\n\nAfter:\n- 1. Nxf6 gxf6\n- 2. Qxh6+ Kg8\n- 3. Qh7+ Kf8\n- 4. Qh8+ Ke7\n- 5. Qg7+ Ke8 \u2014 king escapes.\n\nNot forced mate. But White is winning material: we sacrificed knight for pawn, but now queen invades.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after Nxf6, is g7xf6 forced?\n\nYes \u2014 otherwise if Black doesn\u2019t take, say Kxh6? No \u2014 knight takes on f6, king not on f6.\n\nAfter Nxf6+, Black king is on h8, so only g7xf6 takes.\n\nSo yes, forced.\n\nBut after Qxh6+, Black plays Kg8, and now:\n\nCan we play **Bxh6**? No \u2014 bishop is on c4.\n\nWait \u2014 after Qxh6+, Kg8, can we play **Rxf6**?\n\nYes! Black played g7xf6, so f6 is occupied.\n\nSo after:\n1. Nxf6 gxf6\n2. Qxh6+ Kg8\n3. **Rxf6!** \u2014 rook takes on f6, attacking queen?\n\nNo \u2014 Black queen is on f"
