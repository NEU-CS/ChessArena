When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\nr5k1/7p/p3N2q/1p1Q2p1/5Nb1/2PB2PP/PP5K/4r3 b - - 1 26\n```\n\nWe are playing as **Black** (since the FEN indicates `b` for side to move).\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Positional Overview**\n\n**Black to move.**\n\nLet\u2019s reconstruct the key pieces:\n\n#### **Black\u2019s pieces:**\n- King: g8\n- Rook: e1 (on White\u2019s back rank)\n- Rook: a8\n- Queen: h6\n- Knight: g4\n- Pawns: a6, b5, g5, h7\n\n#### **White\u2019s pieces:**\n- King: h2\n- Queen: d5\n- Knight: e6\n- Bishop: f4 (from g4f4 in legal moves, but actually it's on f4 \u2014 wait, no: g4 is occupied by Black knight, so White\u2019s bishop is on c3)\n- Bishop: g4 \u2014 wait, no: g4 has Black knight. So White\u2019s bishop is on f4? Let's double-check.\n\nWait \u2014 in the FEN: `r5k1/7p/p3N2q/1p1Q2p1/5Nb1/2PB2PP/PP5K/4r3`\n\nLet\u2019s break it down rank by rank (from rank 8 to 1):\n\n- **8**: r . . . . . k .  \u2192 a8=Rook, h8=King\n- **7**: . . . . . . . p \u2192 h7=pawn\n- **6**: a . . . N . . q \u2192 a6=pawn, e6=White Knight, h6=Black Queen\n- **5**: . p . Q . . g . \u2192 b5=Black pawn, d5=White Queen, g5=Black pawn\n- **4**: . . . . . N b . \u2192 f4=White Knight, g4=Black Knight\n- **3**: . . P B . . G G \u2192 c3=White pawn, d3=White Bishop, g3=White pawn, h3=White pawn\n- **2**: P P . . . . . K \u2192 a2, b2 pawns, h2=White King\n- **1**: . . . . r . . . \u2192 e1=Black Rook\n\nSo:\n\n- White pieces:\n  - King: h2\n  - Queen: d5\n  - Knight: e6 and f4\n  - Bishop: d3\n  - Pawns: c3, g3, h3, a2, b2, g2? Wait \u2014 g3 and h3 are pawns, but g2 is not mentioned. Actually, g3 and h3 are on rank 3, so pawns on g3/h3. a2, b2. So pawns: a2, b2, c3, g3, h3.\n\n- Black pieces:\n  - King: g8\n  - Rooks: a8, e1\n  - Queen: h6\n  - Knight: g4\n  - Pawns: a6, b5, g5, h7\n\nWait \u2014 in the FEN, rank 3: `2PB2PP` \u2192 so c3=P, d3=B, then two empty, then g3=P, h3=P \u2192 yes.\n\nSo White bishop is on d3, not f4. The knight on f4 is White (from `5Nb1` \u2192 f4=N, g4=b).\n\nSo White knight on f4, Black knight on g4.\n\nWait \u2014 that can\u2019t be. Two pieces on g4?\n\nNo: `5Nb1` means: five empty, then N (knight), then b (Black pawn?), then one empty.\n\nWait \u2014 `5Nb1` \u2192 that\u2019s rank 4: five empty squares, then N (White knight on f4), then b (Black pawn?), then one empty.\n\nBut we already have g5 as a Black pawn. Is there a pawn on g4?\n\nNo \u2014 g4 is occupied by Black knight.\n\nWait \u2014 in the FEN: `5Nb1` \u2192 positions a4 to h4:\n\na4: empty  \nb4: empty  \nc4: empty  \nd4: empty  \ne4: empty  \nf4: N (White knight)  \ng4: b (Black pawn?)  \nh4: empty\n\nBut earlier we thought g4 has a Black knight.\n\nConflict.\n\nWait \u2014 in the legal moves list, we have:\n\n- `g4e6`, `g4h5`, etc. \u2014 so g4 is a **Black piece** that can move.\n\nAnd the move `g4e6` suggests it's a knight (since e6 is occupied by White knight \u2014 so capture).\n\nSo g4 must be a **Black knight**, not a pawn.\n\nBut in FEN: `5Nb1` \u2014 that\u2019s five empty, then N (f4=White knight), then b (g4=Black pawn?), then one empty.\n\nBut that would be a pawn on g4, not a knight.\n\nBut the legal moves include `g4e6`, `g4f5`, `g4h3`, etc. \u2014 all knight moves.\n\nSo **g4 must be a knight**, not a pawn.\n\nTherefore, the FEN must have a typo or we misread.\n\nWait \u2014 `5Nb1` \u2014 is that \"5N\" meaning five empty and a knight, then \"b1\"?\n\nNo \u2014 FEN uses digits for consecutive empty squares.\n\nSo `5Nb1` = five empty, then a piece 'N', then a piece 'b', then one empty.\n\nSo:\n- f4: N (White knight)\n- g4: b (Black pawn)\n\nBut that contradicts the legal moves, which include `g4e6`, `g4f5`, etc. \u2014 knight moves.\n\nUnless the 'b' is not a pawn but a **Black bishop**? But 'b' in FEN is Black pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 no: in FEN, lowercase letters are Black pieces:\n- p = pawn\n- n = knight\n- b = bishop\n- r = rook\n- q = queen\n- k = king\n\nSo 'b' = Black **bishop**.\n\nAh! That\u2019s the key.\n\nSo `5Nb1` means:\n- a4: empty\n- b4: empty\n- c4: empty\n- d4: empty\n- e4: empty\n- f4: N (White knight)\n- g4: b (Black **bishop**)\n- h4: empty\n\nBut the legal moves include `g4e6`, `g4f5`, `g4h3`, `g4f3`, `g4e2`, `g4d1` \u2014 all diagonal moves? Wait:\n\n- g4 to e6: g4\u2192e6 is diagonal? g4 to e6 is two left, two up \u2192 yes, diagonal \u2014 bishop move.\n- g4 to f5: one left, one up \u2014 diagonal \u2014 yes.\n- g4 to h3: one right, one down \u2014 diagonal \u2014 yes.\n- g4 to f3: two left, one down \u2014 not diagonal \u2014 that\u2019s knight move.\n\nWait \u2014 `g4f3` is not a legal bishop move.\n\ng4 to f3 is file from g to f (left one), rank from 4 to 3 (down one) \u2192 that **is** diagonal \u2014 yes, one square diagonally.\n\nYes, f3 is adjacent diagonal to g4.\n\nSo all these are bishop moves.\n\nSo g4 is a **Black bishop**, not a knight.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was a knight because of `g4e6` \u2014 but e6 has a White knight.\n\nSo `g4e6` is a capture: BxN.\n\nYes, possible.\n\nSo correction:\n\n- g4: Black **bishop**\n- f4: White knight\n- e6: White knight\n- h6: Black queen\n- e1: Black rook\n- a8: Black rook\n- g8: Black king\n- h2: White king\n- d5: White queen\n- d3: White bishop\n- c3: White pawn\n- etc.\n\nAlso, in the FEN: `1p1Q2p1` on rank 5 \u2192 a5 to h5:\na5: empty\nb5: p (Black pawn)\nc5: empty\nd5: Q (White queen)\ne5: empty\nf5: empty\ng5: p (Black pawn)\nh5: empty\n\nSo g5 has a Black pawn.\n\nBut g4 has a Black bishop \u2014 so two Black pieces on g-file? g5 and g4 \u2014 yes, stacked \u2014 possible.\n\ng5=pawn, g4=bishop \u2014 yes, on adjacent squares.\n\nSo all consistent.\n\nNow, **Black to move**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Key Tactical Features**\n\nLet\u2019s look for threats and opportunities.\n\n#### **White\u2019s threats:**\n- White queen on d5 is central.\n- White knight on e6 is very strong \u2014 attacking f8 and possibly threatening mate?\n- White knight on f4 \u2014 active.\n- White bishop on d3 \u2014 aimed at h7.\n\nBut White has no immediate mate threat.\n\n#### **Black\u2019s pieces:**\n- Rook on e1 \u2014 very strong, on White\u2019s"
