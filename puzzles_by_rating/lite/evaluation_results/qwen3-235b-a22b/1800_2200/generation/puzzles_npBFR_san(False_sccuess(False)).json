When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Understand the Position**\n\nFEN breakdown:\n- **Black to move**\n- Black king on e8, White king on f6 (very advanced!)\n- White queen on g7, delivering a **check**?\nWait \u2014 let's reconstruct the board.\n\nLet\u2019s lay out the board (from rank 8 to rank 1):\n\n```\n8:  3 r e k 3     \u2192  - - - r e k - -  \u2192 but wait: \"3rk3\" \u2192 3 empty, then r, k, then 3 empty \u2192 so: ---rk---\n7:  5 f Q h p     \u2192 -----fQhp \u2192 but it's \"5fQp\" \u2192 5 empty, f, Q, p \u2192 ------fQp\n6:  4 e p K 2     \u2192 ----epK-- \u2192 so: ----epK--\n5:  2 n 5         \u2192 --n-----\n4:  8             \u2192 ........\n3:  1 P 1 R 4     \u2192 -P-R----\n2:  A 1 P 3 P P   \u2192 A-P---PP \u2192 \"P1P3PP\" \u2192 P-P---PP\n1:  4 q 3         \u2192 ----q---\n```\n\nWait \u2014 let's do this properly:\n\nEach number is empty squares, letters are pieces (uppercase = White, lowercase = Black).\n\nSo:\n\n**Rank 8**: `3rk3` \u2192 `--- r e k ---` \u2192 squares: a8=empty, b8=empty, c8=empty, d8=**r**, e8=**k**, f8=empty, g8=empty, h8=empty  \n\u2192 Black rook on d8, Black king on e8\n\n**Rank 7**: `5fQp` \u2192 5 empty, then f, Q, p \u2192 a7-e7 empty, f7=**f** (Black pawn?), g7=**Q** (White queen), h7=**p** (Black pawn)  \n\u2192 So: f7=black pawn, g7=white queen, h7=black pawn\n\n**Rank 6**: `4pK2` \u2192 4 empty, p, K, 2 empty \u2192 a6-d6 empty, e6=**p** (black pawn), f6=**K** (White king), g6-h6 empty\n\n**Rank 5**: `2n5` \u2192 2 empty, n, 5 empty \u2192 a5-b5 empty, c5=**n** (Black knight), rest empty\n\n**Rank 4**: `8` \u2192 all empty\n\n**Rank 3**: `1P1R4` \u2192 1 empty, P, 1 empty, R, 4 empty \u2192 a3=empty, b3=**P** (White pawn), c3=empty, d3=**R** (White rook), e3-h3 empty\n\n**Rank 2**: `P1P3PP` \u2192 P, empty, P, 3 empty, P, P \u2192 a2=**P**, b2=empty, c2=**P**, d2-h2: d2=empty, e2=empty, f2=empty, g2=**P**, h2=**P**\n\n**Rank 1**: `4q3` \u2192 4 empty, q, 3 empty \u2192 a1-d1 empty, e1=**q** (Black queen), f1-h1 empty\n\nSo final board:\n\n```\n8:  -  -  -  r  k  -  -  -\n7:  -  -  -  -  -  p  Q  p\n6:  -  -  -  -  p  K  -  -\n5:  -  -  n  -  -  -  -  -\n4:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -\n3:  -  P  -  R  -  -  -  -\n2:  P  -  P  -  -  -  P  P\n1:  -  -  -  -  q  -  -  -\n```\n\nPieces:\n- **Black**:\n  - King: e8\n  - Queen: e1\n  - Rook: d8\n  - Knight: c5\n  - Pawns: e6, f7, h7\n- **White**:\n  - King: f6\n  - Queen: g7\n  - Rook: d3\n  - Pawns: b3, a2, c2, g2, h2\n\n---\n\n### **2. Is Black in Check?**\n\nWhite queen is on g7, Black king on e8.\n\nQueen on g7 can move diagonally: g7 \u2192 f6 \u2192 e5 \u2192 d4 \u2192 c3 \u2192 b2 \u2192 a1 \u2014 but e8 is not on that diagonal.\n\ng7 to e8? g7 (g-file, 7th rank) \u2192 e8 (e-file, 8th rank): difference is -2 file, +1 rank \u2192 not diagonal.\n\nIs there a check?\n\nWait \u2014 queen on g7, king on e8.\n\ng7 to e8: file difference = -2, rank difference = +1 \u2192 not aligned.\n\nRook on d3? No.\n\nKing on f6? f6 is adjacent to e6, e7, f7, g7, g6, g5, e5, f5 \u2014 not e8.\n\nSo **Black is not in check**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **White queen on g7** \u2014 can it attack e8?\n\ng7 to e8: that\u2019s two files left, one rank up \u2192 that\u2019s a knight move, not queen.\n\nQueen moves diagonally or straight.\n\nFrom g7:\n- Diagonally: h8, f6, e5, d4, etc. \u2014 e8 is not on that diagonal.\n- Horizontally: same rank \u2014 g7 \u2192 a7-h7 \u2014 h7 is black pawn, so e8 not on same rank.\n- Vertically: g-file \u2014 g7 to g8 \u2014 but g8 is empty.\n\nSo **no**, Black king on e8 is **not in check**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **White king on f6** \u2014 is it in check?\n\nBlack queen on e1 \u2014 can it check f6?\n\ne1 to f6: +1 file, +5 rank \u2192 not a straight line. Not same file, not same rank, not diagonal (1,5 is not 1:1 slope). So no.\n\nBlack knight on c5 \u2014 can it attack f6? c5 to f6: +3 file, +1 rank \u2192 that\u2019s a knight move? Knight moves 2 in one direction, 1 in other. 3 and 1 \u2192 no, not a knight move.\n\nc5 to e6? Yes. c5 to d7, b7, a6, e4, a4, d3, b3 \u2014 f6 is not reachable.\n\nSo **neither king is in check**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 **White queen on g7** \u2014 what is it doing?\n\nIt\u2019s **attacking h7** (but h7 is black pawn), and more importantly, it\u2019s **attacking e7**, **f6**, **h6**, etc.\n\nBut crucially \u2014 **is the White king on f6 safe**?\n\nLet\u2019s look at **Black queen on e1** \u2014 can it attack f6?\n\nNo, as above.\n\nBut what about **Black rook on d8**? d8 to f6? Not aligned.\n\nBut **Black knight on c5** \u2014 can it go to e4? e4 is two files right, one rank down \u2192 yes, that\u2019s a knight move.\n\nc5-e4: e4 is empty.\n\nFrom e4, knight attacks f6 \u2014 yes! e4 attacks f6.\n\nSo if Black plays **c5-e4**, then **knight attacks White king on f6** \u2014 **check**.\n\nBut is that legal? Let\u2019s see.\n\nBut first \u2014 is the White king on f6 in check **now**? No.\n\nBut after **c5-e4**, it would be.\n\nBut is that the best move?\n\nWait \u2014 let\u2019s look at **Black queen on e1**.\n\nIt has many moves: e1e5, e1a5, e1h4, e1e4, e1b4, e1g3, e1e3, e1c3, e1f2, e1e2, e1d2, e1h1, e1g1, e1f1, e1d1, e1c1, e1b1, e1a1\n\nAlso, rook on d8: d8c8, d8b8, d8a8, d8d7, d8d6, d8d5, d8d4, d8d3\n\nKnight on c5: c5d7, c5b7, c5a6, c5e4, c5a4, c"
