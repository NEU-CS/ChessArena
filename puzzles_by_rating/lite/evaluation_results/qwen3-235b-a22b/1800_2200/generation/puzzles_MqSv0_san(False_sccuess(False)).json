When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

No immediate material imbalances.\n\n**Key features:**\n- White has a **passed pawn on c5**, which is very strong. It's supported by the king on c4 and could promote if not stopped.\n- Black's knight on b7 is poorly placed \u2014 it's on the edge and not very active.\n- Black's king is on c6, trying to stop the c5 pawn.\n- White's king is on c4 \u2014 very active, supporting the c5 pawn.\n- Black has a pawn on e4, which is blocking White's f3 pawn.\n- White has a knight on a4 \u2014 currently not doing much.\n- White has a potential **outside passed pawn on the kingside** (g4, f3, h3), but it's not yet advanced.\n\n**Main plans:**\n- **White:** Push the c5 pawn to c6 and promote. The king is ideally placed to support this.\n- **Black:** Use the knight and king to stop the c-pawn, while using the kingside pawns to create counterplay.\n\nBut the **c-pawn is key**. If White can get it to c6, it will be very hard to stop.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze candidate moves\n\nWe go through each legal move.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `c4d4` \u2014 King to d4\n\n- King moves away from c5 pawn.\n- Loses direct support of c5.\n- Now c5 is only supported by nothing \u2014 knight on a4 is too far.\n- Black can play ...Kxc5 next move and win the pawn.\n- **Losing the c5 pawn for no gain**.\n- **Bad move**.\n\n\u274c Reject.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. `c4b4` \u2014 King to b4\n\n- King moves closer to a6 and b7.\n- Still supports c5 (diagonally).\n- But now the king is moving toward the queenside, possibly to attack a6.\n- However, a6 is not a big threat.\n- But: if king goes to b4, then b5 might follow, but Black can play ...a5+ or ...Kb6.\n- More importantly: **does it help the c5 pawn?**\n- c5 is still supported, but king is moving away from the center.\n- Not clearly better than staying on c4 or going forward.\n\nBut consider: **a4 knight can now jump to b6** if the knight is traded, but let's see.\n\nWait \u2014 **a4b6** is a separate move.\n\nBut `c4b4` doesn't immediately threaten anything.\n\nAlso, after `c4b4`, Black can play ...Kxc5! \u2014 because c5 is only supported by the king on b4? No \u2014 is it?\n\nFrom b4, king **does** support c5 (adjacent square).\n\nSo ...Kxc5 would be met by b4xc5, recapturing.\n\nSo c5 is safe.\n\nBut still, king moves sideways \u2014 not progress.\n\nCompare to pushing the pawn.\n\n\u274c Not the best.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. `c4c3` \u2014 King to c3\n\n- Moves king down, away from c5.\n- c5 now only supported by king on c3 \u2014 still supported.\n- But king is going backward.\n- Black can play ...Kxc5, then White recaptures with c3xc5.\n- But now White king is on c5, which might be good \u2014 but we could have done that with c4-c5 later.\n\nBut this move doesn't gain anything \u2014 in fact, it allows ...Kxc5 immediately.\n\nWhy allow the trade when we can **force** it under better conditions?\n\nAlso, king on c3 is less active.\n\n\u274c Worse than staying on c4.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. `c4b3` \u2014 King to b3\n\n- Similar to c4b4, but even worse \u2014 now king is on b3.\n- Still supports c5? b3 to c5 is two squares away \u2014 no, **b3 does NOT support c5**.\n- So c5 is **unsupported**!\n- Black plays ...Kxc5, wins the pawn.\n- White cannot recapture.\n\nSo this **loses the c5 pawn immediately**.\n\n\u274c Blunder. Reject.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. `a4b6` \u2014 Knight to b6\n\n- Knight captures on b6? But b6 is empty.\n- Wait \u2014 is there a piece on b6? No. So it's just moving to b6.\n- But b6 is occupied by... no, in the FEN: b6 is empty.\n- But **Black's king is on c6** \u2014 so if knight goes to b6, it **attacks the king** \u2014 **check**!\n\nYes! `a4b6+` is a **check**.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- Nb6+ \u2014 knight from a4 to b6, giving check to king on c6.\n- What can Black do?\n\nKing on c6 is in check from knight on b6.\n\nKing can go to:\n- c7\n- d7\n- d6\n- b6 (but b6 is attacked by knight? No \u2014 knight is on b6 now, so can't go there)\n- b5\n\nSo legal king moves: c7, d7, d6, b5.\n\nBut also \u2014 can Black **capture the knight**?\n\n- Is any piece attacking b6? Only the king, but it can't capture because it's in check.\n- The knight is on b6, attacked only by king \u2014 but king is in check, so must get out of check.\n\nSo Black **must move the king**.\n\nAfter Nb6+, Black moves king.\n\nThen what?\n\nWhite can play **c5-c6**, a **passed pawn one step from promotion**.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n1. Nb6+ Kd6 (for example)\n2. c6!\n\nNow the pawn is on c6, and Black\u2019s king is on d6 \u2014 but **cannot capture** because c6 is protected by the knight on b6.\n\nKnight on b6 guards c8, c7, a8, a4, d7, d5, etc. \u2014 importantly, it guards **c8**, **c7**, and **d8**, but **not c6**.\n\nWait \u2014 does the knight on b6 protect c6?\n\nKnight on b6:\n- Moves: a8, c8, d7, d5, c4, a4 \u2014 no, **c6 is not attacked by knight on b6**.\n\nSo after:\n\n1. Nb6+ Kd6\n2. c6?\n\nThen Black plays ...Kxc6, and wins the pawn.\n\nBecause knight on b6 does **not** protect c6.\n\nSo c6 is **not protected**.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nWait \u2014 is there any protection?\n\nAfter Nb6+, if Black moves king, can White play c5-c6?\n\nOnly if c6 is protected.\n\nBut currently, **no piece protects c6**.\n\nWhite king is on c4 \u2014 c4 to c6 is two squares \u2014 no.\n\nKnight on b6 doesn't cover c6.\n\nSo c6 is **not protected**.\n\nSo after Nb6+ Kd6, c6?? allows ...Kxc6.\n\nSo **c6 is not a threat**.\n\nBut what if Black plays ...Kb5 after Nb6+?\n\n1. Nb6+ Kb5\n2. c6? Kxb6 \u2014 again, knight not protecting c6.\n\nSo Black just captures the knight and then the"
