If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully.

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/p3k3/1p2P3/2n2P1p/2B2K2/8/8/8 b - - 2 44\n```\n\nThis means:\n- It's **Black's move** (the `b` in the FEN).\n- Black king is on e7.\n- White king is on f4.\n- White has a pawn on e6 and a bishop on c4.\n- Black has a knight on c5, pawns on a7, b6, and h5.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Material Count**\n- White: King (f4), Bishop (c4), Pawn (e6)\n- Black: King (e7), Knight (c5), Pawns (a7, b6, h5)\n\nMaterial is roughly equal: bishop vs knight, same number of pawns.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Features of the Position**\n\n1. **White's pawn on e6** is very advanced and threatens to promote. It's only one square away from e7.\n2. **Black king is on e7**, directly blocking the e6 pawn.\n3. **White king is on f4**, supporting the e6 pawn and potentially aiming to assist promotion.\n4. **Black knight on c5** is somewhat active but has limited targets.\n5. **Black pawns on a7, b6, h5**: a7 and b6 are on the queenside, h5 on the kingside.\n6. The position is very closed; few open lines.\n\n---\n\n### **Goal for Black**\n- Prevent White's e6 pawn from promoting.\n- Avoid losing material.\n- Try to create counterplay or force a draw if winning is not possible.\n\nBut note: **White is close to promoting**. If White gets to play e6-e7, then e7-e8=Q, unless Black can prevent it.\n\nCurrently, **Black king is on e7**, blocking the e6 pawn.\n\nSo if Black moves the king away from e7, White plays e6-e7, then promotes next move.\n\nTherefore, **any king move away from e7 must be carefully evaluated**.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluate Legal Moves**\n\nList of legal moves for Black:\n- **King moves**: e7f8, e7e8, e7d8, e7f6, e7d6\n- **Knight moves**: c5d7, c5b7, c5e6, c5a6, c5e4, c5a4, c5d3, c5b3\n- **Pawn moves**: a7a6, b6b5, h5h4, a7a5\n\nLet\u2019s go through them.\n\n---\n\n#### **King Moves**\n\n1. **e7f8** \u2013 King moves to f8\n   - e6 pawn is now unblocked. White plays **e6-e7**, then next move e7-e8=Q.\n   - Black cannot stop promotion. Losing.\n   - **Very bad**.\n\n2. **e7e8** \u2013 King captures on e8?\n   - But e8 is empty. Why would king go there?\n   - After e7e8, White plays e6-e7, forks king and promotes.\n   - King on e8, pawn moves e7, attacks e8. Then e7-e8=Q+.\n   - Immediate loss.\n   - **Terrible**.\n\n3. **e7d8** \u2013 King to d8\n   - Again, unblocks e6 pawn. White plays e6-e7+, forking king and queening.\n   - Black king on d8, e7+ checks, then e8=Q.\n   - **Losing**.\n\n4. **e7f6** \u2013 King to f6\n   - Unblocks e6 pawn. White plays e6-e7, then e8=Q.\n   - Also, f6 is attacked by White's bishop on c4? No: c4 to f6 is diagonal? c4\u2013f7\u2013g6, no. c4 to f6 is not a diagonal.\n   - But still, e6-e7 happens, promotion follows.\n   - **Losing**.\n\n5. **e7d6** \u2013 King to d6\n   - Again, e6 pawn advances to e7, then e8=Q.\n   - **Losing**.\n\n\u2705 **Conclusion**: **All king moves lose immediately** because they allow e6-e7, leading to promotion.\n\nSo **do not move the king**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Knight Moves**\n\nNow consider knight on c5.\n\n1. **c5d7** \u2013 Knight to d7\n   - Defends e5 and possibly c5, but more importantly, **controls e8**.\n   - After c5d7, if White plays e6-e7, Black can play ...Nd7xe5? No, e5 is empty.\n   - Wait: if White plays e6-e7, Black can play ...Nd7-f6 or ...Nd7-c5, but that doesn't stop e7-e8=Q.\n   - **Does not prevent promotion**.\n   - So after c5d7, White plays e6-e7, then e8=Q. Still losing.\n   - **No help**.\n\n2. **c5b7** \u2013 Knight to b7\n   - Away from center, passive. No effect on e6-e7.\n   - White promotes. **Bad**.\n\n3. **c5e6** \u2013 Knight captures on e6!\n   - This is **very interesting**.\n   - Let's see: ...c5xe6\n     - Black captures the e6 pawn.\n     - Material: knight for pawn \u2014 acceptable if it stops promotion.\n     - After c5e6, the e6 pawn is gone.\n     - White has no immediate promotion threat.\n     - Now the position is more balanced.\n     - White has bishop vs knight, but no passed pawn.\n     - Black has king on e7, knight on e6, pawns.\n     - Is this safe?\n\n     Let\u2019s check: after **...c5e6**, White\u2019s response?\n\n     - White has bishop on c4, king on f4.\n     - Can White win the knight? e.g., f5-f6? But f5 is occupied by White pawn.\n     - f5 is a pawn, so f4-f5 is not possible (already occupied).\n     - White can play f5-f6? f6 is empty? Let's see board:\n\n       Rank 6: 1p2P3 \u2192 so e6 is occupied (by pawn, now captured), f6 is empty.\n\n       So after ...c5e6, White can play **f5-f6!**\n\n       Then: f6, attacking e7 king? No, but threatens to promote.\n\n       Black has knight on e6, which is now attacked by f6 pawn?\n\n       f6 pawn attacks e7 and g7.\n\n       So knight on e6 is **not** attacked.\n\n       But f6 is a passed pawn now.\n\n       However, Black can respond with ...e7-f6? King takes.\n\n       But king on e7 takes on f6: e7xf6.\n\n       Then we have:\n\n       - White: bishop c4, king f4\n       - Black: king f6, knight e6, pawns\n\n       But now White can play Kf4-f5, attacking knight.\n\n       Then Kf5-e6, winning the knight.\n\n       So let\u2019s trace:\n\n       1. ... c5e6\n       2. f5f6 g7g6? (but no g7 pawn) \u2014 Black has no g-pawn.\n\n       Actually, after 1...c5e6 2. f5f6 e7xf6\n\n       Now 3. Kf4-f5\n\n       Black must move knight. From e6, knight can go to d8, c7, c5, d4, f4, f8, etc.\n\n       But f5 is occupied by White king.\n\n       So knight on e6 can go to d4, c5, c7, d8, f8, f4 (but f4 is attacked by king? No, f4 is empty now).\n\n       After 3. Kf5, Black plays ...e6-d4 or ...e6-c5.\n\n       Then White has bishop vs knight, but no pawns near promotion.\n\n       Black has pawns on a7, b6, h5 \u2014 can try to push.\n\n       So it's a drawish endgame, but **at least Black survives**.\n\n       Compare to king moves: all lose immediately.\n\n       So **c5e6** is much better.\n\n       But wait \u2014 after ...c5e6, can White play something else?\n\n       What about **Kf4-e5**?\n\n       After ...c5e6, Ke5 attacks knight on e6.\n\n       Then Black must move knight or defend.\n\n       Knight can go to d8, c7, d4, f4, f8, c5.\n\n       Say ...e6-d4, then White has Ke5-d5, etc.\n\n       But again, no immediate win.\n\n       So **c5e6** removes the dangerous e6 pawn and leads to a drawn or slightly worse but playable endgame.\n\n       **Much better than losing immediately**.\n\n4. **c5a6** \u2013 Knight to a6\n   - Passive, no effect on center.\n   - White plays e6-e7, promotes.\n   - **Losing**.\n\n5. **c"
