When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/8/2k2nB1/p1P1p2p/P1K2p1P/5P2/8/8 b - - 1 59\n```\n\nThis means:\n- It's **Black's move** (b)\n- The position is late endgame\n- Black has a knight on f6 and king on c6\n- White has a bishop on g6, king on c4, pawns on c5, a4, f3, h4, and h3\n- Black has pawns on a5, e5, f4, h5\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the position carefully.\n\n---\n\n### **Material:**\n- Black: King (c6), Knight (f6), pawns a5, e5, f4, h5\n- White: King (c4), Bishop (g6), pawns c5, a4, f3, h4, h3\n\nWhite has a slight material edge (bishop vs knight, and more pawns), but the position is very closed and the key factor is **king activity and pawn structure**.\n\n---\n\n### **Pawn Structure and Key Features:**\n\n- **c5 is a protected passed pawn** for White, supported by king on c4.\n- Black\u2019s king is on c6 \u2014 very close to c5, so it can blockade or attack it.\n- The pawn on e5 is isolated and could be a target.\n- f4 is a Black pawn, attacking f3.\n- White\u2019s bishop on g6 is quite strong \u2014 it controls the long diagonal and could support the c5 pawn or attack Black\u2019s king.\n- However, the bishop is **color-bound** \u2014 it\u2019s on light squares, so it can\u2019t control dark squares.\n- Black\u2019s knight on f6 is somewhat passive but has several possible moves.\n\n---\n\n### **King Activity:**\n- White king on c4 \u2014 active, supporting c5 and potentially centralizing.\n- Black king on c6 \u2014 also active, can support ...e4 or go after c5.\n\n---\n\n### **Threats:**\n- White threatens to push **c5-c6**, creating a dangerous passer.\n- Black must prevent c6 or prepare to blockade it.\n- If Black plays ...e4, it opens the position and may allow White\u2019s bishop to become more active.\n\n---\n\n### **Candidate Moves:**\n\nList of legal moves:\n- **f6g8** (Ng8)\n- **f6e8** (Ne8)\n- **f6h7** (Nh7)\n- **f6d7** (Nd7)\n- **f6d5** (Nd5)\n- **f6g4** (Ng4)\n- **f6e4** (Ne4)\n- **c6d7** (Kd7)\n- **c6c7** (Kc7)\n- **c6b7** (Kb7)\n- **e5e4** (e4)\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Knight moves:**\n\n#### **f6g8 (Ng8)** \u2014 Retreats to corner. Loses time. No clear purpose. Bad.\n\n#### **f6e8 (Ne8)** \u2014 Retreats, but keeps knight near center. Might reroute to d6 or f7. Passive.\n\n#### **f6h7 (Nh7)** \u2014 Knight goes to edge. Only useful if targeting g5 or f8, but no immediate gain. Loses activity.\n\n#### **f6d7 (Nd7)** \u2014 Covers c5, prepares to support ...Kc7 or ...e4. Solid. Knight defends against c6 push.\n\n#### **f6d5 (Nd5)** \u2014 Knight jumps to d5. But c5 is defended by White king, so no capture. Knight is attacked by nothing, but is it useful? It eyes e3, f4, c7, b6. But f4 is a Black pawn, so no fork. Could be useful if White plays c6, but not urgent.\n\n#### **f6g4 (Ng4)** \u2014 Attacks f3 pawn. But f3 is defended by g2? Wait \u2014 no g2 pawn. White has f3, h3, h4. So f3 is only defended by nothing? Wait \u2014 let's check:\n\nWhite pawns: c5, a4, f3, h4, h3 \u2014 so f3 is on f3, and no pawn on g2. So f3 is **only defended by the bishop on g6**.\n\nSo if Black plays **Ng4**, it attacks f3. If White doesn\u2019t respond, Black can take f3, opening the f-file and weakening White\u2019s structure.\n\nBut after **Ng4**, White can play **Bxf4**, capturing the f4 pawn, which is undefended.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n- **...Ng4**\n- **Bxf4** \u2014 now Black has knight on g4, White has bishop on f4.\n  - Black can play ...e4, blocking the diagonal.\n  - Or ...Nxf3? But Bg3 would defend.\n\nBut **Ng4** leads to **Bxf4**, which removes Black\u2019s f4 pawn and activates White\u2019s bishop.\n\nAlso, after Bxf4, the e5 pawn is under pressure.\n\nSo **Ng4** looks risky \u2014 it allows White to open lines and activate the bishop.\n\n#### **f6e4 (Ne4)** \u2014 Knight to e4. Attacks f3 and d6. But again, f3 is defended only by bishop. So if Black plays Ne4, White can play **Bxe5**, winning a pawn!\n\nBecause:\n- ...Ne4\n- **Bxe5!** \u2014 knight can\u2019t recapture (no piece on d5 or f5), and Black loses a pawn.\n\nSo **Ne4??** loses material immediately.\n\nSo **f6e4** is a blunder.\n\n---\n\n### **King moves:**\n\n#### **c6d7 (Kd7)** \u2014 Centralizes king, supports e5, prepares to go to d8 or c7. Solid.\n\n#### **c6c7 (Kc7)** \u2014 Directly attacks c5 pawn. Very strong idea.\n\nIf Black plays **Kc7**, then:\n- White must defend c5.\n- King on c4 cannot directly protect c5 because of opposition? Wait: c4 vs c7 \u2014 not directly.\n\nBut after **Kc7**, White can play **Kb5**, supporting c5 and threatening to advance.\n\nBut **Kc7** puts maximum pressure on c5.\n\nAlso, if c5-c6+, then **Kc7-c8!**, and the pawn is blocked, and Black king is behind it.\n\nSo **Kc7** is a strong candidate.\n\n#### **c6b7 (Kb7)** \u2014 Goes to b7, supports a5, prepares to go to b6 to attack c5.\n\nAlso a solid plan, but slower than Kc7.\n\n---\n\n### **e5e4 (e4)** \u2014 Pushing the e-pawn.\n\nThis opens the position.\n\nBut after **e4**, White can play **c6!**, because now the e4 pawn blocks the knight from defending c5.\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n- ...e4\n- **c6!** \u2014 now the pawn advances.\n  - If **Kxc6**, then **Bxe4+**, winning the e4 pawn and forking king and knight? No \u2014 Bxe4+ checks, king must move, then bishop is safe.\n\nAfter:\n- ...e4\n- c6 bxc6?\n- Bxe4+ \u2014 check, so king must move: Kc7 or Kd7\n- Then Bxc6 \u2014 wins a pawn.\n\nBut Black doesn\u2019t have to take: after c6, Black can play ...Kd7, but then c6 is strong.\n\nAlso, **e4** weakens d4 and f4.\n\nMoreover, **e4** allows **c6**, which is very dangerous.\n\nSo **e4** looks **premature** and risky.\n\n---\n\n### **Best Candidates:**\n\n1. **c6c7 (Kc7)** \u2014 Directly challenges c5, prepares to blockade c6.\n2. **c6d7 (Kd7)** \u2014 Flexible, supports e5 and c5.\n3. **f6d7 (Nd7)** \u2014 Knight supports c5 blockade.\n4. **c6b7 (Kb7)** \u2014 Slow but solid.\n\nLet\u2019s compare **Kc7** vs **Kd7**.\n\nAfter **Kc7**:\n- White\u2019s best is **Kb5**, supporting c6.\n- Then Black can play **Kc8**, and if c6, then **Kc7** again? Wait \u2014 no, c6+ would force Kc8.\n\nBut if c6, then **Kc8!**, and the pawn is blocked, and White cannot make progress easily.\n\nAlso, Black can later play ...a4 to distract.\n\nBut after **Kc7**, if White plays **c6**, then **Kc7-c8**, and the pawn is blocked.\n\nIf White doesn\u2019t play c6, then Black can maintain pressure.\n\nNow, what if Black plays **Kd7**?\n\nThen White can play **c6+!**, because king is on d7, so **c6+ Kd8**, and now **Kb5**, and the pawn is very strong.\n\nAfter **c6+ Kd8**, White can follow with Kb5, and the c6 pawn is hard to stop.\n\nSo **Kd7** allows **c6+** with tempo.\n\nBut if Black"
