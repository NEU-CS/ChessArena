When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

No pieces, only pawns and kings.\n\n**Pawn structure**:\n- White has a4/a2, c3, d4, f3, g2/h4\n- Black has a5/b5, d5, g7/g6/h6\n\nNote:\n- d4 vs d5 \u2014 locked in center.\n- White has a potential pawn chain: c3-d4.\n- Black has a5-b5 \u2014 advanced but isolated.\n- White\u2019s king is on b3 \u2014 close to queenside.\n- Black king on d6 \u2014 central, active.\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n- Black\u2019s b5 pawn is weak \u2014 only protected by a5.\n- White\u2019s c3 pawn is protected by king and b3 king.\n- Black\u2019s kingside pawns are on g6/h6 \u2014 not very advanced.\n- White\u2019s h4 pawn can push to h5 to restrict Black.\n\n**Goals**:\n- White wants to create a passed pawn or promote.\n- Black may try to advance g7-g5 or h6-h5 to create counterplay.\n- White\u2019s king is near the queenside \u2014 could support a4-a5 or c3-c4.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Moves Analysis\n\nLet\u2019s go through each legal move:\n\n---\n\n#### 1. `b3a3` \u2014 King to a3\n- Brings king closer to a-pawn.\n- Protects a2 pawn.\n- But king moves away from center and c3 pawn.\n- c3 pawn becomes less protected \u2014 only by a2 now.\n- Not very useful \u2014 a-file is blocked by a5/a2/a4 ideas.\n- Slightly passive.\n\n#### 2. `b3c2` \u2014 King to c2\n- Centralizes king slightly.\n- Protects c3 pawn directly.\n- Connects with d4 pawn.\n- Prepares potential king march to d3, e3, etc.\n- Keeps king in center.\n- Solid.\n\n#### 3. `b3b2` \u2014 King to b2\n- Defends a2 and c3.\n- But retreats king.\n- Less active than c2.\n- b2 is a bit passive.\n\n#### 4. `h4h5` \u2014 h-pawn to h5\n- Closes the kingside.\n- Prevents Black from playing g6-g5.\n- Restricts Black\u2019s kingside expansion.\n- Could be useful if Black tries to create a passed g-pawn.\n- However, it doesn\u2019t create a passed pawn for White.\n- Might be useful prophylactically.\n\n#### 5. `f3f4` \u2014 f-pawn to f4\n- Creates a pawn chain d4-e4-f4? But e4 not occupied.\n- Opens diagonal for king to e3?\n- But no immediate threat.\n- Could be useful to support e4 push later.\n- But e4 not possible now \u2014 d5 blocks.\n- f4 might weaken e4 square.\n- Not urgent.\n\n#### 6. `c3c4` \u2014 c-pawn to c4\n- Breaks in the center.\n- Attacks d5 pawn.\n- If c4xd5, then cxd5, and White gets a passed d-pawn?\n  - After c4xd5, exd5? No \u2014 Black has d5 pawn, so c4xd5, then Black recaptures with c-pawn? But Black has no c-pawn.\n  - Black has pawns on a5, b5, d5, g7, g6, h6 \u2014 no c-pawn.\n  - So if c4xd5, Black must recapture with king or b5 pawn.\n    - If b5xd5, then White recaptures with d4xd5 \u2014 now White has a passed d-pawn!\n    - d5-pawn can advance.\n  - Alternatively, Black king takes: Kxd5, then White plays d4-d5, creating a passed d-pawn.\n- So **c3c4** is a **central break** that can create a **passed pawn**.\n\nThis looks **very promising**.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\n- 1. c4 dxc4\n  - But wait \u2014 c3c4, then d5-dxc4? No \u2014 d5 is Black\u2019s pawn. c4 attacks d5.\n  - So: c3c4 attacks d5.\n  - Black must respond:\n    - a) d5xc4 \u2014 then b3xc4 \u2014 White has c4, d4, now connected passed pawns? No \u2014 d4 still there.\n      - After c4xd5, if Black plays ...d5xc4, then b3xc4 \u2014 White has pawns on c4 and d4 \u2014 connected, central, advanced.\n      - Black king must come to stop them.\n    - b) b5-b4? To prevent c4? But b5-b4 loses b5 pawn to c3xb4.\n    - c) Kd6-e6 or Kd6-c6 \u2014 king moves to defend d5.\n\nBut after c3c4, if Black doesn't take, say ...b5"
