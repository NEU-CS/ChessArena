When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Wait \u2014 pawns on c4, b2, a2, and h3? Let's check:\n\nFrom 8th rank down:\n\n- 8: `5rk1` \u2192 empty, then R, K, empty\n- 7: `p1N1R2p` \u2192 a7: black pawn, b7: empty, c7: N (White), d7: empty, e7: R (White), f7/g7: empty, h7: p (black)\n- 6: `5p2` \u2192 f6: black pawn\n- 5: `1p6` \u2192 b5: black pawn\n- 4: `2P1bq2` \u2192 c4: White pawn, d4: empty, e4: B (Black), f4: Q (Black), rest empty\n- 3: `7P` \u2192 h3: White pawn\n- 2: `PPP5` \u2192 a2, b2, c2: White pawns\n- 1: `R2Q3K` \u2192 a1: R, d1: Q, h1: K\n\nSo White pieces:\n- King: h1\n- Queen: d1\n- Rooks: a1, e7\n- Knight: c7\n- Pawns: a2, b2, c2, c4, h3\n\nBlack pieces:\n- King: g8\n- Rook: f8\n- Queen: f4\n- Bishop: e4\n- Pawns: a7, b5, f6, h7\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Position\n\nWhite has:\n- A rook on e7 attacking the 7th rank, pinning or pressuring the black king.\n- Knight on c7, deep in Black\u2019s position, possibly threatening tactics.\n- Queen on d1, somewhat passive.\n- King on h1, relatively safe but could be exposed.\n\nBlack has:\n- Queen on f4 \u2014 very active, eyeing h2 and possibly g2.\n- Bishop on e4 \u2014 also active, controlling central diagonals.\n- Rook on f8, defending the king.\n- King on g8 \u2014 potentially vulnerable due to open g-file and White\u2019s rook on e7.\n\nKey features:\n- **White has a rook on e7**, which is **attacking along the 7th rank**.\n- The **c7 knight** is well placed, possibly supporting a mating attack.\n- Black\u2019s queen and bishop are **coordinated**, and **e4 is a strong outpost**.\n- **White\u2019s king is on h1**, and **Black\u2019s queen on f4** is pointing at h2 \u2014 a potential weakness.\n- **No pawn on g2**, so h2 is only defended by the king and possibly rook on a1 via g1.\n\nBut White has **only three legal moves**: `h1g1`, `e7e4`, `d1f3`\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move 1: `h1g1` \u2014 King moves to g1\n\nThis moves the king from h1 to g1.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Gets the king away from the corner.\n- May connect the rooks (a1 and e7) via g1.\n- Avoids potential back-rank issues? But Black doesn\u2019t have immediate back-rank threats.\n\n**Cons:**\n- King moves toward the center \u2014 but is it safer?\n- h2 is now **undefended**. Black has:\n  - Queen on f4\n  - Bishop on e4\n  - Both can potentially target h2.\n\nAfter `h1g1`, is h2 attacked?\n\n- Queen f4 \u2192 h2? f4 to h2 is diagonal: f4-e3-d2-c1? No \u2014 f4 to h2 is not diagonal. f4 is light square, h2 is dark \u2014 so **queen cannot attack h2 directly**.\n- Bishop on e4: e4 to h1 is diagonal (e4-f5-g6-h7? No). e4-d3-c2-b1? No. e4-f3-g2-h1 \u2014 yes! e4 to h1 is a diagonal. So **Bishop on e4 attacks h1**, but **after king moves to g1**, h1 is empty, and h2 is not on that diagonal.\n\nWait: e4 to h2? e4-d5-c6-b7-a8? No. e4-f3-g2-h1 \u2014 that\u2019s the diagonal. So **g2 and h1** are on the diagonal, but **h2 is not**.\n\nSo h2 is **not attacked by Black\u2019s bishop or queen**.\n\nSo `h1g1` is **safe**.\n\nBut does it gain anything?\n\n- Connects rooks? Possibly prepares Kg1-f1 or Kg1-g2.\n- But currently, no immediate threat.\n\nHowever, consider: if White plays `h1g1`, Black might play `...Qf4-h4`, threatening mate on h2? Let\u2019s see:\n\nAfter `h1g1`, can Black play `Qh4`?\n\n- Qf4-h4: yes.\n- Then Qh4-h2#? Is that mate?\n\nCheck: h2 is attacked by queen. Is it defended?\n\n- After `h1g1`, h2 is defended only by g1 king? No \u2014 king is on g1, so h2 is adjacent \u2014 so **king on g1 defends h2**.\n\nSo `Qh4-h2` would be **blocked or captured by king**.\n\nSo no mate.\n\nSo `h1g1` is safe, but **passive**. Doesn\u2019t create a threat.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Move 2: `e7e4` \u2014 Rook takes on e4\n\nRook on e7 captures the bishop on e4.\n\nSo `e7e4` \u2014 rook takes bishop.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze:\n\nAfter `e7e4`, Black can recapture with **queen**: `Qf4xe4`\n\nNow the position becomes:\n\n- White rook on e4\n- Black queen on e4\n- White has knight on c7, rook on a1, queen on d1, etc.\n\nIs this good?\n\nLet\u2019s see:\n\n- Black queen is now on e4, still active.\n- White has removed a key defender \u2014 but at what cost?\n\nBut wait: **White has a knight on c7**, which is **attacking a8 (rook?)** \u2014 no, a8 is empty. a7 has a black pawn.\n\nc7 knight: where is it attacking?\n\nKnight on c7 attacks:\n- b5, d5, e8, e6, d8, b8, a6, a8\n\nRelevant squares:\n- e8: black king is on g8, rook on f8 \u2014 e8 is empty.\n- d5: empty\n- b5: black pawn\n- e6: empty\n- d8: empty\n- b8: empty\n\nBut **if the rook is no longer on e7, the knight on c7 is hanging**?\n\nWait: is the knight on c7 protected?\n\nCurrently, who protects c7 knight?\n\n- No pawn or piece directly protects it.\n- e7 rook is on e7 \u2014 does it protect c7? No, rook moves straight \u2014 e7 to c7 is not aligned.\n- So **knight on c7 is unprotected**.\n\nBut after `e7e4`, the rook leaves e7 \u2014 so knight is still unprotected.\n\nBut Black can play `Qf4xe4` \u2014 but can Black play `Qf4xc7`?\n\nQueen on f4 to c7: f4-e5-d6-c7 \u2014 yes, diagonal. So **Black can capture the knight on c7**.\n\nBut only if it\u2019s not defended.\n\nIs c7 defended?\n\nCurrently:\n- c7 knight is attacked by Black queen on f4? f4 to c7: yes, diagonal \u2014 so **knight on c7 is under attack**!\n\nWait \u2014 is that true?\n\nQueen on f4, knight on c7:\n\n- f4 to c7: f4-e5-d6-c7 \u2014 that\u2019s a diagonal (light squares? f4 is light, c7 is"
