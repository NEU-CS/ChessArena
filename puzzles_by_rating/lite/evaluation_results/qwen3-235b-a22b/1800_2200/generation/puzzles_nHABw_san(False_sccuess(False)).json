If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n2rrb1k1/p2nqpp1/1p2p2p/1P2N3/P1P5/1Q1B4/5PPP/2R1R1K1 w - - 2 23\n```\n\nWhite to move.\n\nLet\u2019s first **analyze the position** step by step.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Positional Overview**\n\n**White's material:**\n- King on g1\n- Rooks on c1 and e1\n- Knight on e5\n- Bishop on d3\n- Queen on b3\n- Pawns: a4, b5, c4, f2, g2, h2\n\n**Black's material:**\n- King on g8\n- Rooks on c8 and d8\n- Bishop on e8\n- Knight on d7\n- Queen on e7\n- Pawns: a7, b6, e6, f7, g7, h6\n\n**Key features:**\n- White has a knight on **e5**, very central and active.\n- Black has doubled rooks on the d-file (c8 and d8), but the d-file is not fully open.\n- White\u2019s queen on b3 is pointing at the kingside, especially the f7-pawn.\n- The knight on e5 is **attacking f7**, which is only defended by the king and the queen on e7.\n- White has a **bishop on d3**, which can potentially target h7 or f7.\n- Black\u2019s king is still in the center, but castled (g8), so relatively safe \u2014 but vulnerable to tactics.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Tactical Opportunities**\n\nLet\u2019s look for **tactics**, especially **forks, pins, skewers, discovered attacks, and mating nets**.\n\n#### **Candidate: e5xf7? (e5f7)**\nThis is a **knight capture on f7**.\n\nLet\u2019s examine:\n- e5xf7: Knight takes on f7.\n- f7 is defended by:\n  - King on g8\n  - Queen on e7\n\nSo, if we play **e5f7**, Black can recapture with **Kxf7** or **Qxf7**.\n\nBut after **e5f7**, what happens?\n\nLet\u2019s suppose:\n1. e5f7+ Kxf7? \u2014 but wait, is it check?\n\nNo \u2014 knight on e5 to f7 is **not a check**, because f7 is not in line with the king on g8 diagonally or orthogonally in a checking way from e5. Wait \u2014 actually:\n\n- e5 to f7 is a knight move: L-shape (forward 2, right 1). From e5 to f7 is valid.\n- But **f7 is adjacent to g8**, so if the knight lands on f7, it **attacks g8** \u2014 the black king!\n\nSo **e5f7 is a check!**\n\nYes! Knight from e5 to f7 gives **check** to the king on g8.\n\nSo:\n- **e5f7+** \u2014 knight checks the king.\n\nNow Black must respond:\n- King cannot go to h8 (no immediate attack, but let's see).\n- King cannot go to g8 \u2192 f8? f8 is attacked by knight on f7? No \u2014 knight on f7 attacks g5, h6, e5, d6, d8, e9? Wait:\n\nKnight on f7 attacks:\n- g5, h6, e5, d6, d8, e9? No \u2014 standard knight moves:\n- f7 \u2192 g5, h6, e5, d6, d8, e9? No:\nActually:\n- f7 \u2192 g5 (down 2, right 1)\n- f7 \u2192 h6 (down 1, right 2)\n- f7 \u2192 e5 (up 2, left 1)\n- f7 \u2192 d6 (down 1, left 2)\n- f7 \u2192 d8 (up 1, left 2)\n- f7 \u2192 e9? No \u2014 invalid.\nSo **d8 and g5, h6, e5, d6**\n\nSo **g8 is under attack**, but **f8 is not attacked** by the knight.\n\nSo Black king can go to **f8** or **h8**.\n\nBut also, can Black **capture the knight**?\n\nYes \u2014 with **queen on e7**: e7xf7 \u2014 that\u2019s a legal move.\n\nSo Black has:\n1. Kf8\n2. Kh8\n3. Qxf7\n\nLet\u2019s analyze each:\n\n---\n\n#### **After e5f7+**, Black plays:\n1. **Qxf7** \u2014 queen takes knight.\n   - Then White plays **Qb3xf7+**, check!\n   - Now Black king must go to **Kh8** or **Kf8**.\n   - Suppose **Kh8**, then White has **Qf7+**, and now can follow up with **Qg6** or **Qxh6+**, possibly mating.\n\nLet\u2019s try:\n- 1. e5f7+ Qxf7\n- 2. Qb3xf7+ Kxf7\n- Now White has **Rook on e1**, **Bishop on d3**, **Knight was captured**, but now:\n- **Re1-e8+** \u2014 discovered check? No \u2014 bishop on d3 is on d3, e8 is behind.\n\nWait \u2014 after Qxf7, Kxf7, the king is on f7.\n\nNow White can play:\n- **Bd3xh7!** \u2014 bishop takes h7 pawn!\n  - Now Black must respond to the threat of mate on g8 or h8.\n  - King is on f7, so **Bxh7**, then:\n    - Threatens **Re1-e8#** \u2014 because e8 is now only defended by... nothing? Black rook on d8, but e8 is behind.\n\nAfter:\n- 1. e5f7+ Qxf7\n- 2. Qb3xf7+ Kxf7\n- 3. Bd3xh7\n\nNow Black must prevent **Re8#**.\n\nCan Black play **Rd8-e8**? Yes \u2014 **Rd8e8**, blocking.\n\nBut then White plays **Re1xe8**, Rxe8.\n\nNow material:\n- White: bishop and rook for queen? Let\u2019s count:\n  - White lost knight and gained bishop (h7) and rook (e8)\n  - Black lost queen and rook and pawn\n  - So White is up a knight and a pawn? Wait:\n\nActually:\n- White: gave knight (3), got queen (9) and pawn (1) \u2014 net +7\n- But then traded queen for queen \u2014 so even on queens\n- Then bishop takes h7 (1), then rook takes rook on e8 (5)\n- So White gained: knight (3) + h7 pawn (1) + rook (5) = 9\n- Lost: knight (3) + queen (9) \u2014 net -3? No, wait:\n\nWait \u2014 better to track:\n\nAfter:\n- e5f7+: White gains knight on f7 (but it's captured)\n- Qxf7: Black takes knight\n- Qxf7+: White takes queen\n- Kxf7: Black king recaptures\n- Now material:\n  - White lost knight (3)\n  - Black lost queen (9)\n  - So White is **up 6 points** \u2014 huge!\n\nThen:\n- Bd3xh7: White takes pawn\n- Rd8e8: Black blocks\n- Re1xe8: White takes rook\n\nNow:\n- White gains rook (5) and pawn (1) \u2014 total +6\n- Already up 6 from queen for knight\n- Total material gain: **queen + rook + pawn vs knight + knight** \u2014 White is up **queen and pawn vs rook** \u2014 massive advantage.\n\nBut more importantly \u2014 is there a **faster win**?\n\nBack to **e5f7+**, suppose Black doesn't take, but plays **Kf8**?\n\n- 1. e5f7+ Kf8\n- Now White has **Qb3xf7!** \u2014 no check, but attacking queen and threatening mate on g8 or h7.\n\nBlack must respond:\n- Qe7xf7? Then Re1-e8+! Kf8-g8? Re8-e7 \u2014 winning the queen.\n\nWait:\n- 1. e5f7+ Kf8\n- 2. Qb3xf7 Qxf7\n- 3. Re1-e8+ Kf8-g8? (only move)\n- 4. Re8-e7 \u2014 wins the queen.\n\nSo White wins a piece \u2014 queen for knight.\n\nEven better.\n\nIf after **e5f7+ Kf8**, Black doesn\u2019t take queen, say **Rd8-e8**, then **Qf7#** \u2014 mate!\n\nBecause:\n- Queen on b3 to f7 \u2014 is that possible? b3 to f7 is diagonal? b3\u2013c4\u2013d5\u2013e6\u2013f7 \u2014 yes, same diagonal.\n\nSo:\n- 1. e5f7+ Kf8\n- 2. Qb3f7! \u2014 threatening mate on g8.\n\nIf Black plays **Re8**, then **Qf7#** \u2014 because f7 is protected by bishop on d3?"
