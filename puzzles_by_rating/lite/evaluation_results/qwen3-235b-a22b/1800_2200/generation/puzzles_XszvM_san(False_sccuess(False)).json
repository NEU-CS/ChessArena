When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "We are given the following FEN:\n\n```\n8/1p6/p2R2nk/6R1/3P1P1n/1P1K4/5r2/8 w - - 5 51\n```\n\nThis means:\n- It's White's turn to move (`w`).\n- No castling rights.\n- No en passant target.\n- Halfmove clock: 5, Move number: 51.\n\nLet\u2019s first **visualize the board** based on the FEN:\n\n```\n8th rank:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -\n7th rank:  -  p  -  -  -  -  -  -\n6th rank:  a  -  -  R  -  -  n  k\n5th rank:  -  -  -  -  -  R  -  -\n4th rank:  -  -  -  P  -  P  -  n\n3rd rank:  -  P  -  K  -  -  -  -\n2nd rank:  -  -  -  -  -  r  -  -\n1st rank:  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -\n        a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h\n```\n\n### Key Pieces:\n\n**White:**\n- King on d3\n- Rook on d6\n- Rook on g5\n- Pawns on b3, d4, f4\n\n**Black:**\n- King on g6\n- Knight on h4 (g4 is empty, so h4)\n- Knight on h6\n- Rook on f2\n- Pawns on a6, b7\n\n### Threats and Tactical Observations:\n\n1. **Black's king is on g6**, exposed.\n2. **White has two rooks** \u2014 one on d6, one on g5 \u2014 both potentially active.\n3. **Black has a rook on f2**, attacking the d3 king along the 2nd rank? No \u2014 f2 is on the 2nd rank, king is on d3, so not directly threatening unless supported.\n   - But f2 is attacking d2, e2, f1, f3, etc. f2 is **attacking f3**, which is adjacent to d3. But no immediate check.\n4. **White to move**.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze **candidate moves** from the legal list:\n\n```\nd6d8, d6d7, d6g6, d6f6, d6e6, d6c6, d6b6, d6a6, d6d5,\ng5g6, g5h5, g5f5, g5e5, g5d5, g5c5, g5b5, g5a5, g5g4, g5g3, g5g2, g5g1,\nd3e4, d3c4, d3e3, d3c3,\nf4f5, d4d5, b3b4\n```\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Look for **immediate tactical shots** \u2014 checks, captures, threats.\n\n#### Consider **d6g6+** \u2014 Rook takes on g6 with check?\n\n- d6 \u2192 g6: is that legal? Yes, rook moves horizontally/vertically.\n- d6 is on d-file, g6 is on g-file \u2014 so horizontal move: d6 to g6 is along the 6th rank.\n- Is the path clear? d6-e6-f6-g6: e6 and f6 are empty? Let's see:\n  - e6: empty\n  - f6: empty\n  - g6: occupied by **Black king**\n- So **d6g6** would be **capturing the king** \u2014 i.e., **check**.\n\nBut is it **legal**? Only if it's a **check** and the king can escape.\n\nSo **d6g6+** is a **check**.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze **d6g6+**:\n\n- White plays Rxd6\u2192g6+, checking the black king on g6.\n- Can the black king capture the rook? King on g6, rook lands on g6 \u2014 so king is on same square? No \u2014 the rook **captures** the king? No \u2014 in chess, you don't capture the king, but you can deliver check.\n\nWait \u2014 **the king is on g6**, and we are moving **Rd6 to g6** \u2014 that square is **occupied by the enemy king** \u2014 so this is a **capture**, i.e., **check**.\n\nBut is it **checkmate**?\n\nAfter **1. Rxg6+**, Black must respond.\n\nCan the king capture the rook? King on g6, rook on g6 \u2014 after capture, king would be on g6, but the rook is there \u2014 so yes, **king captures back: Kxg6**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is that possible?\n\n- After **Rd6xg6+**, Black plays **Kxg6**, capturing the rook.\n- Then White has other pieces \u2014 but now the g5 rook is on g5, which is adjacent to g6.\n\nSo after **1. Rxg6+ Kxg6**, then **2. Rg5xg6+**? But that would be **Rg5 taking on g6**, checking again.\n\nWait \u2014 after Kxg6, the king is on g6, and Rg5 is on g5 \u2014 so **Rg5-g6+** would be check.\n\nBut is that possible?\n\n- Rg5 to g6: yes, vertically.\n- So **2. Rg6+**, then Black king must move.\n\nWhere can the king go?\n\n- g6: attacked by Rg6\n- f6: is it attacked? Not yet.\n- h6: has a black knight.\n\nAfter **1. Rxg6+ Kxg6 2. Rg5-g6+**, Black king is on g6, and now **Rg6+** checks.\n\nKing must move:\n\n- f6: possible?\n  - f6 is not occupied.\n  - Is f6 attacked? Not yet.\n- h6: occupied by black knight.\n- g7: empty? Yes, but is it attacked?\n\nBut after **2. Rg6+**, Black plays **Kf6** or **Kh7**?\n\nWait \u2014 **Kf6**:\n\n- Then White has **f4-f5** coming? Or d4-d5?\n\nBut let\u2019s go back \u2014 is **d6g6+** even a good move?\n\nWait \u2014 after **1. Rxg6+ Kxg6 2. Rg5xg6+**, Black plays **Kf6** or **Kh7**.\n\nBut **2... Kh7** allows **3. Rg7+**, skewering or checking.\n\nBut let\u2019s see: after **1. Rxg6+ Kxg6 2. Rg5xg6+ Kh7**, then **3. Rg7+** (check), **Kh8**, then **Rxb7**? But b7 is a pawn.\n\nBut Black has a knight on h4 and h6, and rook on f2.\n\nBut this line seems messy \u2014 and we **lose a rook** for a king escape.\n\nBut is **d6g6+** actually **legal**?\n\nWait \u2014 **the black king is on g6**, and **d6 to g6** is along the 6th rank \u2014 yes, rook can move there.\n\nBut is there a **pin** or something?\n\nNo \u2014 the rook on d6 is not pinned.\n\nBut let\u2019s consider: after **1. Rxg6+ Kxg6**, White plays **2. Rg5xg6+**, then **Kf6** or **Kh7**.\n\nBut **2... Kf6**:\n\n- Then White can play **f4-f5**, attacking the knight on h4? No \u2014 f5 attacks g5, e5, but not h4.\n\nAlternatively, **Rg6+** is already played.\n\nBut the point is: **d6g6+** wins the knight on h6? No \u2014 h6 is still there.\n\nWait \u2014 **after 1. Rxg6+ Kxg6 2. Rxg6+**, Black must move king \u2014 but **if Black plays 2... Kh7**, then **3. Rg7+ Kh8**, and now White can play **Rxb7**, winning a pawn.\n\nBut Black can play **3... Ng8** or something.\n\nBut this seems **not forced** and only gains a pawn.\n\nBut is there a **better** move?\n\nWait \u2014 what about **g5g6**?\n\n**g5g6**: pawn on g5? No \u2014 g5 has a **rook**, not a pawn.\n\nWait \u2014 pawns: White has pawns on b3, d4, f4.\n\nSo **g5g6** is **rook moving from g5 to g6**.\n\nSo **Rg5-g6+**?\n\n- Rook on g5 to g6 \u2014 that\u2019s **check**, because king is on g6.\n\nSo **1. Rg5-g6+** \u2014 is that possible?\n\n- g5 to g6: vertical move, yes.\n- g6 is"
