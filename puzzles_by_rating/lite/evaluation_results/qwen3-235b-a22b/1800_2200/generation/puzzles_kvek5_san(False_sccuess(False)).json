When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Yes: Nf6+.\n- Can black capture? f6 is occupied by a black pawn, but knight captures it.\n- After **Nxf6+**, black must respond.\n\nLet\u2019s simulate:\n\n1. **g4f6+** \u2192 Nxf6+\n   - Black king on f7 is in check.\n   - Can it move? \n     - f7-e7? e7 is not attacked? Let's see:\n       - White knight on f6 attacks e8, g8, d7, h7, e4, g4 \u2014 not e7.\n       - White bishop on g3: diagonal a8-h1 \u2014 does it hit e7? g3 to e7 is g3-f4-e5-d6-c7-b8 \u2014 no, not on same diagonal.\n       - Other knights: d4 and h4 \u2014 d4 attacks e6, f5, c6, c2, etc. \u2014 not e7.\n       - So e7 is safe.\n     - f7-g7? g7 is attacked by white knight on h5? No h5 knight. h4 knight? h4 attacks f5, g6, f3 \u2014 not g7.\n       - g7 is safe.\n     - f7-g8? g8 is attacked by knight on f6? Nf6 attacks g8 \u2014 yes! So g8 is not safe.\n     - f7-e8? e8 \u2014 attacked by Nf6? Nf6 attacks e8 \u2014 yes. Not safe.\n     - f7-e6? e6 has a black knight \u2014 occupied. Can't go there.\n   - So king can go to **e7** or **g7**.\n\nBut wait \u2014 after **Nxf6+**, black can also **capture the knight** with the **e6 pawn**?\n\n- e6xf6? That would be a recapture.\n\nBut e6 is occupied by a black knight! So **e6 is not a pawn** \u2014 it's a knight.\n\nSo **no pawn on e6** \u2014 it's a knight.\n\nSo **no recapture by pawn**.\n\nOnly the king can move.\n\nSo after **Nxf6+**, king must go to **e7** or **g7**.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose **Kg7**.\n\nNow, what happens?\n\n- White has a knight on f6, which is now **forking** the king on g7 and the rook on h8!\n- So after **Kg7**, White plays **Nf6xh8**, winning the rook.\n\nSo material gain: already up a knight, now win a rook for knight \u2014 huge.\n\nLet\u2019s count:\n\n- Before: White up a knight.\n- After: White captures rook, loses knight \u2014 so net gain: rook for knight \u2014 **up by exchange plus extra knight earlier**.\n\nWait \u2014 was White really up a knight?\n\nLet\u2019s recount:\n\nWhite knights: d4, g4, h4 \u2192 3\nBlack knights: e6 \u2192 1\n\nSo White has **two extra knights** \u2014 so up **a knight and a bit more**.\n\nAfter **Nxf6+ Kxf6??** \u2014 wait no, king can't capture because f6 is attacked by bishop?\n\nWait \u2014 **can the black king capture on f6?**\n\nAfter **Nxf6+**, king on f7 \u2014 can it take the knight?\n\n- f7xf6"
