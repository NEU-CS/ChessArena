When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

Rook vs Knight + pawn is about equal, so material is balanced.\n\n**King safety:**\n- White king on g2 is relatively safe.\n- Black king on f7 is exposed, especially with h5 pawn pushing and potential back-rank issues.\n\n**Tactical motifs:**\n- Black queen on d5 is active, attacking e4 and possibly d1.\n- White rook on e3 is attacking e4 pawn, but e4 is defended by knight on d4.\n- Black rook on g4 is attacking g3 pawn and eyeing g2.\n- White has a passed h5 pawn, could be dangerous.\n- Back-rank possibility? Black king on f7, rook on g4, but no immediate back-rank mate.\n\n**Threats:**\n- Black threatens ...g7-g6 or ...g7-h6 to defend h5, but not urgent.\n- Black could play ...Qd5-e5 or ...Qd5-g2+? But g2 is protected by f1 rook.\n- ...Qg2+?? would be met by Rxg2, winning queen.\n- Black might try ...Ne2+ or ...Nf3+? But knight on d4: Nf3+ would be Nf3+, but g2 is protected.\n\nWait: Nf3+? d4-f3+? Then g2-f3? But king can take: Kxf3? But then rook on e3 is hanging? Let's not get distracted.\n\n### Step 2: Candidate moves\n\nWe are given a list of legal moves:\n\n```\ne3e4, e3f3, e3d3, e3c3, e3b3, e3a3, e3e2, e3e1,\ng2h3, g2h2, g2h1, g2g1,\nf1h1, f1g1, f1e1,\nd1g4, d1d4, d1a4, d1f3, d1d3, d1b3, d1e2, d1d2, d1c2, d1e1, d1c1, d1b1, d1a1,\nh5h6, f2f3, a2a3, f2f4, a2a4\n```\n\nNote: \"f2f3\", \"f2f4\" \u2014 but king is on g2, not f2. Typo? Wait: FEN says `P4PK1` on 2nd rank \u2192 a2, f2, g2? No:\n\n`P4PK1` \u2192 P (a2), then 4 empty, then P (f2?), K (g2), then 1 empty \u2192 so king is on g2, and f2 is a pawn? But in FEN: `P4PK1` \u2192 a2: P, f2: P, g2: K, h2: empty.\n\nWait \u2014 that contradicts earlier. Let's re-parse:\n\nFEN: `P4PK1` \u2192 means:\n- a2: P\n- b2: empty\n- c2: empty\n- d2: empty\n- e2: empty\n- f2: P\n- g2: K\n- h2: empty\n\nSo pawns on a2 and f2, king on g2.\n\nBut in the legal moves list, we have:\n- `f2f3`, `f2f4` \u2014 so f2 is a pawn, yes.\n- Also `g2h3`, `g2h2`, etc. \u2014 but g2 is king, so those are king moves.\n\nSo king on g2, pawn on f2.\n\nSo legal king moves: g2-h3, g2-h2, g2-h1, g2-g1\n\nRook e3: can go to e4, f3, d3, c3, b3, a3, e2, e1\n\nRook f1: f1-h1, f1-g1, f1-e1\n\nQueen d1: many options\n\nPawn: h5-h6, f2-f3, f2-f4, a2-a3, a2-a4\n\nNow, let's look for **tactics**.\n\n### Step 3: Look for immediate tactics\n\n**Is there a way to win material or deliver checkmate?**\n\nConsider: White to move.\n\nBlack queen on d5, knight on d4, rook on g4.\n\nCan we **pin** or **skewer**?\n\nLook at **d1g4**: Qd1-g4 \u2014 is that possible?\n\nQd1 to g4: diagonal? d1 to g4 is same diagonal (a4-d1 is diagonal, but d1-g4 is 3 squares up-right: d1-e2-f3-g4 \u2014 yes, diagonal.\n\nBut is it blocked?\n\nd1-e2-f3-g4: e2 and f3 are empty? Let's see:\n\n- e2: empty (from FEN: 2nd rank has a2, f2, g2 \u2014 so e2 is empty)\n- f3: empty? 3rd rank: e3 has rook, g3 has pawn \u2014 f3 is empty.\n\nSo d1-e2-f3-g4: all empty. So **d1g4** is legal.\n\nNow, what happens if **Qd1-g4**?\n\n- White captures black rook on g4.\n- But black can recapture with king: Kf7xg4?\n\nYes \u2014 king on f7 can take on g4.\n\nSo Qxg4, Kxg4 \u2014 exchange of queen and rook.\n\nMaterial: White loses queen, gains rook; black loses ro"
