When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The legal moves are `g1h1`, `g1f1`, and `h4f2`.\n\nLet's analyze each move:\n\n1.  **`g1f1`**: This move gets the King out of check, but it walks into a checkmate. Black will play `...Qd1#`. The Black Queen is supported by the Bishop on g4, and my King on f1 has no escape squares. This is an immediate loss.\n\n2.  **`h4f2`**: This move blocks the check by interposing my Queen. However, this also leads to a forced checkmate. The sequence is:\n    *   `h4f2 Qxf2+` (Black captures the queen, checking the king)\n    *   `g1xf2 Be2+` (Black delivers a discovered check from the Rook on a8 and a direct check from the Bishop on e2. The King is forced to move.)\n    *   No matter where the King moves (`...Kg1`, `...Ke1`, or `...Ke3`), Black delivers checkmate with the Rook on a8 (e.g., `...Ra1#`). This is also an immediate loss.\n\n3.  **`g1h1`**: This is the only move that does not lead to an immediate, forced checkmate. By moving the King to the corner, I escape the current check and force Black to find a new way to continue the attack.\n    *   After `g1h1`, Black's most dangerous threat is `...Qd1`, which threatens `...Qh1#`.\n    *   I can defend against this with `Rg1`.\n    *   The game continues, and while my position is still very dangerous, I have not lost on the spot. I have chances to defend and consolidate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe moves `g1f1` and `h4f2` both lead to a quick and unavoidable checkmate. The only move that allows White to continue the game is `g1h1`. Therefore, it is the absolute best move.\n\n```\ng1h1\n```"
