When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "This is a classic checkmating problem. I am playing as White. My king is on e1, and Black's king is on h6, which is extremely exposed. My rooks on g3 and g7 are perfectly positioned to launch a decisive attack. Black's main counterplay is the rook on a1, which creates a back-rank threat against my king. However, my attack is much faster and more direct. I need to find a forcing sequence of moves that leads to checkmate, ignoring Black's threats as they are too slow.\n\nLet's analyze the candidate moves:\n\n1.  **g7h7 (Rgh7+)**: This is a check. Black's only legal response is to capture the rook with the king: `1... Kxh7`. After this, my other rook joins the attack with `2. g3g7 (Rg7+)`. This is another check. The black king is forced to the corner: `2... Kh8`. Now, I can deliver the final blow with `3. g7g8 (Rg8#)`. The black king on h8 is attacked by my rook on g8 and has no escape squares. The h7 square is also controlled by the rook on g8. This is a forced checkmate in 3 moves.\n\n2.  **g3g6 (R3g6+)**: This is also a check. Black's only legal move is `1... Kh7`. Now, my other rook delivers a check: `2. g7g7 (R7g7+)`. The black king is again forced to the corner: `2... Kh8`. This leads to the exact same mating position as the previous line: `3. g7g8 (Rg8#)`. This is also a forced checkmate in 3 moves.\n\n3.  **e1f2**: This move aims to prevent Black's back-rank check threats by preparing to move the king to safety. However, it is too slow. It gives Black time to organize a defense or create counter-threats, for example, with `...Rc2`. My attack is overwhelming, and I should not waste a tempo on a defensive move when a forced mate is available.\n\n4.  **Other rook moves like g7g5+ or g7f7+**: These moves allow the black king to escape via `...Kxh4`. They are blunders that throw away the win.\n\nBoth `g7h7` and `g3g6` lead to a swift and forced checkmate in 3 moves. They are equally the best moves in this position. I will choose `g7h7` as it starts with a sacrifice, a common theme in such mating attacks.\n\nThe winning sequence is:\n1.  g7h7+ Kxh7\n2.  g3g7+ Kh8\n3.  g7g8#\n\nTherefore, the best move is `g7h7`.\n\n```\ng7h7\n```"
