        "content": "This is a complex endgame where both sides have passed pawns and are racing to promote or deliver checkmate. I am playing as Black.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n*   **Black:** My king on e3 is extremely active. I have two connected passed pawns on d3 and g3, which are major threats. My rook on h2 controls important squares and can join the attack.\n*   **White:** White's main hope is the h7 pawn, which is one square away from promotion. The rook on g7 supports this pawn and defends against some threats on the g-file. The king on g1 is vulnerable.\n\nMy goal is to use my pawn threats and active king to overwhelm White's defenses before the h-pawn can promote and cause problems.\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **`d3d2`**: This move seems natural, pushing the d-pawn. However, after `1... d2`, White can play `2. Rg2`. If I then promote with `2... d1=Q+`, White replies `3. Rxd1+ Kxd1`. Now White plays `4. h8=Q`. In the resulting Queen vs Rook endgame, my king is too exposed. For instance, after `4... g2`, White has `5. Qa8!`, and my king gets caught in a net, leading to a loss for Black. So, `d3d2` is a mistake.\n\n2.  **`e3f4` or other king moves**: Moving the king allows White's rook to give a series of checks (`Rf7+`, `Rg7+`, etc.). While my king can try to escape, this gives White valuable time to consolidate or force a perpetual check, neutralizing my winning chances.\n\n3.  **`h2g2`**: This move pins the White rook to the king. It's a strong move that creates serious problems for White. For example, `1... Rg2 2. Kf1 g2+ 3. Kg1` followed by `...Rh1+` leads to a winning position for Black, but it requires precise calculation through several variations.\n\n4.  **`g3g2`**: This is the most forceful and decisive move. It immediately attacks the rook on g7 and creates an unstoppable dual threat.\n    *   If White tries to promote with `1... g2 2. h8=Q`, I have a forced mate with `2... g1=Q+ 3. Kh2 Qg2#`.\n    *   If White tries to check with `1... g2 2. Re7+`, I play `2... Kf3`, and my king easily escapes while the threats of `...g1=Q` and `...d2` remain.\n    *   Therefore, White's only reasonable response is to capture the pawn: `2. Rxg2`.\n\nAfter `1... g2 2. Rxg2`, the position is still winning for me, but I must find the correct follow-up. The key move is not to push the d-pawn immediately (`2... d2` leads to a draw), but to activate my rook first.\n\nThe winning sequence is:\n`1... g2`\n`2. Rxg2` (Forced)\n`2... Rh1!` (The crucial move. It prepares to support the d-pawn's advance and creates mating threats against the white king).\nNow White is helpless.\n*   If `3. Rg1` (to stop the rook from invading), I play `3... d2`. White's rook is overloaded. `4. Rxh1 d1=Q 5. h8=Q` (too late) `5... Qf3+ 6. Kg0 Qg3+ 7. Kf1 Qf2#`.\n*   If `3. h8=Q`, I play `3... Rxh7`, and my rook and d-pawn will overpower the new queen.\n\nThe move `g3g2` initiates a forced sequence that leads to checkmate or a decisive material advantage. It is the most clinical way to win the game.\n\n```\ng3g2\n```"
