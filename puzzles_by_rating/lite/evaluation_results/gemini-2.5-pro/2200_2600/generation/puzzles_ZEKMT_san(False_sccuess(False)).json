If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

It is Black's turn to move.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n\n*   **Black:** The Black king on g4 is under immediate check from the h3 pawn and is extremely exposed. White's queen on c5 and bishop on d3 form a powerful attacking battery. However, Black's queen on b2 is a major threat to the White king on d1, creating significant counterplay. Black's rooks are ready to join the action.\n*   **White:** White has a ferocious attack underway. The immediate goal is to checkmate the exposed Black king. The queen on c5 is the main attacker, supported by the bishop on d3 and the h3 pawn. White's own king is somewhat vulnerable, which is Black's main hope.\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\nI must move my king out of check. The legal moves are `g4h5`, `g4g5`, `g4h4`, and `g4f4`.\n\n1.  **`g4f4`**: This move is a blunder. White responds with `2. Qe3#`, which is an immediate checkmate. The queen is protected by the king on d1.\n\n2.  **`g4h4`**: This move also leads to a forced loss. White can play `2. Qe5+`.\n    *   If Black plays `2... f5`, White continues `3. g3+ Kh5 4. Be2+ Kg6 5. Bh5+`, which leads to a quick and decisive mating attack.\n    *   If Black plays `2... Kh5`, White plays `3. Be2+ Kg6 4. Bh5+` with a similar mating net.\n    This move walks the king into a death trap.\n\n3.  **`g4g5`**: This move is also losing. White can respond with `2. f4+`.\n    *   If `2... Kh4`, the position transposes into the losing lines of the `g4h4` variation.\n    *   If `2... Kh5`, White plays `3. Be2+ Kh4 4. Qe5+`, and mate follows shortly.\n    Alternatively, White can play `2. Qe5+` immediately, which also leads to a forced mate after either `2... Kh4` or `2... f5`.\n\n4.  **`g4h5`**: This is the only move that saves the game and, in fact, turns the tables in Black's favor. The king finds a surprising sanctuary on the h-file.\n    *   After `1... Kh5`, White's most dangerous tries are met with strong defensive and counter-attacking resources.\n    *   If `2. Be2+`, Black plays `Kh6`. Now if `3. Qe3` (threatening `g3#`), Black has the crucial `...g5!`. After `4. hxg4+ Kg7`, the king is safe, and Black's counter-attack with the queen on b2 becomes decisive.\n    *   If `2. Qe5`, Black responds with the critical `...f5!`. This move blocks the attack and prepares to challenge the White queen. After `3. g3 Qf6`, Black is better.\n    *   If `2. f4`, Black can unleash a powerful counter-attack with `...e5!`, opening lines against the White king.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThree of the four legal moves lead to a forced checkmate for White. Only `g4h5` successfully defends against the immediate threats and creates winning chances for Black. It is therefore the only correct move.\n\n```\ng4h5\n```"
