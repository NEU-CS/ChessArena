        "content": "This is a critical king and pawn endgame. I am playing as Black.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n\n*   **White's Plan:** White's primary threat is the passed b-pawn. The plan is to advance it to b6 and then use their active king on c5 to support its promotion. The White king is perfectly placed to attack my king and shepherd the pawn home.\n*   **Black's Plan:** My goal is survival. I must prevent the b-pawn from queening at all costs. My king is my only piece capable of doing this. I need to find a way to create a fortress or force a stalemate. My kingside pawns on e6 and f6 provide some defensive structure and potential, but very distant, counterplay.\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **Pawn Moves (`e6e5` or `f6f5`):** These moves are losing. For example, after `1... e6e5 2. fxe5 f5`, White is simply faster with their own pawn: `3. b6 Kc8 4. Kc6 Kb8 5. b7 Ka7 6. Kc7`, and the pawn promotes. Pushing my pawns opens lines for the White king and creates weaknesses without providing sufficient counterplay.\n\n2.  **King Moves:** The king's placement is everything here. I must keep it in the vicinity of the b-pawn's path.\n    *   `c7d8`, `c7d7`, `c7b7`: These moves take my king too far away or to the wrong square. For example, `1... c7d7 2. b6 Kc8 3. Kc6 Kb8 4. b7 Ka7 5. Kc7`. White's king gets the opposition and wins easily.\n    *   `c7b8`: This move seems plausible as it gets closer to the promotion square, but it's a fatal error. After `1... Kb8`, White plays `2. b6`. I am forced to play `2... Ka8`. Then `3. Kc6 Kb8 4. b7 Ka7 5. Kc7`, and the pawn queens.\n    *   `c7c8`: This is the correct and only drawing move. It prepares for White's most dangerous threat, `b6`.\n        *   If White plays `2. b6`, I respond with `2... Kb8`. Now the White king cannot make progress. If `3. Kc6`, I play `3... Kc8`, maintaining the opposition. White cannot force my king away. If `3. Kd6`, I have the saving resource `3... Kb7`, and if `4. Kxe6`, my counterplay with `4... f5!` becomes decisive.\n        *   If White plays `2. Kc6`, I respond with `2... Kb8`. Now, if White plays `3. b6`, I play the amazing `3... Ka8!`. White's king is now on c6, and after `4. Kc7`, the position is a stalemate. My king has no legal moves but is not in check.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe move `c7c8` is the only one that holds the draw. It demonstrates a deep understanding of opposition and stalemate possibilities in pawn endgames. All other moves lead to a loss.\n\n```\nc7c8\n```"
