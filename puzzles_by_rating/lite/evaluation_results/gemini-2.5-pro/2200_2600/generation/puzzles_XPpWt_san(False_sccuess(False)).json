        "content": "This is a classic endgame study position, and Black is under immense pressure. White's king on h5, bishop on e5, and the passed g-pawn pose a formidable threat. A passive defense will not suffice, as White can methodically improve their position and force a win.\n\nLet's analyze the candidate moves for Black:\n\n1.  **`f7g8`**: This seems like a natural move to prepare for White's `g6` push. However, it fails to precise play. After `1... Kg8`, White plays `2. g6 hxg6 3. Kxg6`. Now Black's king is on g8. White can continue with the devastating pawn sacrifice `4. f6!`. If Black plays `4... Bxf6`, then `5. Bxf6` puts Black in a lethal zugzwang. If `4... exf6`, `5. Kxf6` and the white king will invade and win the pawn endgame.\n\n2.  **`f8e7`**: This is another logical attempt, preparing to meet `g6` with `Bg7`. This also fails. White has two strong replies:\n    *   `2. f6!`: This direct sacrifice is very powerful. `2... Bxf6 3. Bxf6 Kxf6 4. Kxh6`. This transposes into a king and pawn endgame which is winning for White. The white king will penetrate the queenside and capture Black's pawns.\n    *   `2. g6`: Black replies `2... Bg7`. White continues `3. f6! Bxf6 4. Kxf6`. Here, Black has the resource `4... h5!`, which makes it much harder for White. However, after careful analysis, White can still win by attacking the queenside pawns, for example with `5. Bxd5+`.\n\n3.  **`c6c5`**: This is the only move that saves the game. It is a brilliant paradoxical move that sacrifices a pawn to achieve a positional draw. The idea is not immediately obvious.\n    *   White's best reply is `2. dxc5`.\n    *   Now comes the stunning follow-up: `2... Ba3!!`. The bishop moves to the long diagonal, from where it exerts influence across the board. It prevents the white king from easily accessing f5 and prepares for a miraculous stalemate defense.\n    *   The main line continues: `3. g6 hxg6 4. Kxg6 Kg8 5. h4 Kh8 6. f6 exf6 7. Kxf6 Kg8 8. Ke7`. It looks like the white king is winning, but now Black plays `8... Bxc5+!`.\n    *   `9. Bxc5`. Black is forced to give up the bishop.\n    *   `9... d4!`. A final pawn sacrifice.\n    *   `10. Bxd4`. After White takes the pawn, the black king on g8 has no legal moves and is not in check. This is a stalemate, and the game is a draw.\n\nAny other move by Black loses to White's precise attack. Therefore, the pawn sacrifice is the only path to survival.\n\n```\nc6c5\n```"
