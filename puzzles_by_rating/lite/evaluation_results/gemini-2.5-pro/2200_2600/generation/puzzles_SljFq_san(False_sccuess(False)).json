        "content": "This is a critical endgame position. I am playing as Black.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n\n*   **White's Plan:** White's entire strategy revolves around promoting the c6-pawn. The Bishop on b5 is a powerful piece, controlling key squares like d7 and a6, supporting the pawn's advance, and restricting my King. The White King on b4 is actively placed to support the pawn.\n*   **Black's Plan:** My main asset is the Rook on h2. It controls the second rank and can deliver a series of checks to the exposed White King. My goal is to use this rook to either force a perpetual check, win the c-pawn, or create enough counterplay to force a draw. I must act with urgency, as the move c6-c7 is a game-ending threat.\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **h2c2 (Rc2):** This move directly attacks the pawn, but it is a fatal mistake. White responds with the decisive `2. Bd7!`. This move defends the pawn and prepares to push it to c7. If I play `2... Kf8` to prevent an immediate checkmate upon promotion, White plays `3. c7`. I am then forced to play `3... Rxc7`, leading to `4. Bxc7`. The resulting endgame of Bishop vs. pawns is a simple win for White, whose King will march over to the kingside and capture my remaining pawns.\n\n2.  **e6e5:** This move attempts to create a passed pawn of my own. However, it is far too slow. White simply plays `2. c7!`. My pawn is on e4, but White promotes with `3. c8=Q`. The new Queen will easily stop my pawn, and White wins.\n\n3.  **King moves (e.g., g8h7):** Any King move is also too slow. White plays `2. c7`, and my Rook is unable to stop the pawn from promoting.\n\n4.  **h2b2 (Rb2+):** This is the most forcing and correct move. It immediately puts the White King in check and does not give White time to play c7. This move forces a sequence that leads to a draw. Let's analyze White's responses:\n    *   `2. Ka3 Ra2+ 3. Kb3 Rb2+` leads to a repetition.\n    *   The main line for White to try to win is `2. Ka4 Ra2+ 3. Kb5 Rb2+ 4. Ka6 Ra2+ 5. Kb7 Rb2+`. Now White has a critical choice:\n        *   **A) `6. Kc8`**: My response is `6... Rc2!`. The c-pawn is now attacked, and the key defensive move `Bd7` is not possible because the King is on c8. White must move the King, for example, `7. Kd8`, but then I continue with `7... Rd2+`, forcing the King away. This sequence leads to a perpetual check and a draw.\n        *   **B) `6. Bb6`**: This move blocks the check but at the cost of the Bishop. I must play `6... Rxb6+!`. After `7. Kxb6`, the position has changed. The dangerous Bishop is gone. Now, I must immediately create counterplay with `7... e5!`. This creates a passed e-pawn. The race is on: `8. c7 e4 9. c8=Q e3`. This Queen vs. advanced pawns endgame is a well-known theoretical draw. My King and pawns can form a fortress that the White Queen cannot penetrate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe move `h2b2` is the only one that saves the game. All other moves allow White to play `c7` and win. By forcing a series of checks, I can either secure a draw by perpetual check or transition into a theoretically drawn endgame.\n\nh2b2\n```"
