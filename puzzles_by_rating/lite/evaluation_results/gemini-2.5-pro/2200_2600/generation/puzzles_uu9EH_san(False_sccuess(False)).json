        "content": "This is a rook and pawn endgame. I am playing as White. The position is critical, and my king is currently under check from the Black rook on e2. I must move my king to a safe and strategically sound square.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n\n*   **White's Assets:** My rook on c5 is active, putting pressure on Black's c6 pawn and controlling the c-file. My connected passed pawns on g4 and h4 are a significant long-term advantage.\n*   **White's Liabilities:** My king on g2 is exposed to the check. The b2 pawn is a direct target for Black's rook.\n*   **Black's Assets:** Black's rook on e2 is very active, creating immediate threats. The passed pawn on c4 is Black's main counterplay and a serious danger.\n*   **Black's Liabilities:** The c6 pawn is weak and a target. The king on g8 is somewhat passive.\n\nThe central theme of the position is the race between Black's c-pawn and my ability to stop it while creating my own threats. My king's placement will be decisive.\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\nI have six legal moves, all of which are king moves to escape the check.\n\n1.  **g2f3 (Kf3):** This move places my king on a more exposed square. Black can respond with ...Re3+, forcing my king further into the open, which is undesirable. This move is too risky.\n\n2.  **g2g3 (Kg3) / g2h3 (Kh3):** These moves take my king away from the crucial queenside action. The main battle will be against the c4-pawn. My king needs to participate in that fight. Moving to the kingside makes my king a spectator and allows Black's plan to succeed.\n\n3.  **g2g1 (Kg1) / g2h1 (Kh1):** These moves place the king on the back rank, which is safer than f3, but they are too passive. After 1. Kg1 Rxb2 2. Rxc6 c3, my king is cut off and cannot get to the d-file to help stop the pawn. Black's pawn will become unstoppable.\n\n4.  **g2f1 (Kf1):** This is the best move. It accomplishes several key objectives:\n    *   It moves the king to safety from the immediate check.\n    *   It moves the king towards the center and the queenside, where the decisive action is taking place.\n    *   It prepares my king to march to e1 and then d2 to personally block the advance of the dangerous c-pawn.\n\n**Projected Line:**\n\nAfter `g2f1`, the most likely continuation is:\n1.  ...Rxb2 (Black captures the weak pawn)\n2.  Rxc6 (I eliminate the defender of the c-pawn)\n3.  ...c3 (Black pushes the passed pawn)\n4.  Ke1! (My king moves into position to intercept the pawn)\n\nNow, if Black plays 4...c2, I respond with 5. Kd2, and the pawn is blockaded. My king is active, my rook is active, and my kingside pawns are a winning advantage. If Black tries something else, my king's central position gives me the flexibility to respond effectively.\n\nTherefore, moving the king towards the action is the correct plan.\n\n```\ng2f1\n```"
