When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "This is a critical and highly tactical position. I am playing as White.\n\n**Position Evaluation:**\n\n*   **White's Strengths:** My f6-pawn is a massive threat, just two squares away from promotion. My queen on d3 is active and controls important squares.\n*   **White's Weaknesses:** My king on g1 is somewhat exposed. The black queen on f2 and the passed d2-pawn pose significant threats. The rook on g1 is pinned by the black queen.\n*   **Black's Strengths:** The d2-pawn is one move from promoting (`d1=Q`). The queen on f2 is extremely dangerous, creating mating threats and pinning my g1-rook.\n*   **Black's Weaknesses:** The black king on g8 is also vulnerable, especially with my f-pawn and queen ready to attack. The rook on g7 is a key defender.\n\nThe game is a race. I must press my advantage with the f-pawn while neutralizing Black's threats.\n\n**Candidate Moves Analysis:**\n\n1.  **`f6f7`**: This is the most forcing and promising move. It advances my passed pawn to the seventh rank, creating an immediate and overwhelming threat of promotion.\n    *   If Black responds with `...d1=Q`, I can play `2. f8=Q+`. Black is forced into `2...Rxf8`, after which `3. Qxf8+ Kxf8 4. Rxd1` leaves me up a queen for a rook, which is a simple win.\n    *   If Black responds with `...Rxf7`, I recapture with `2. Qxf7`. This attacks the black queen on f2 and threatens `Qxg7#`. Black cannot defend against both threats. For example, `2...d1=Q+ 3. Kh2` and Black is helpless against the coming `Qxg7#`.\n    *   If Black tries a check first with `...Qe1+`, I play `2. Kh2`. Black still has to deal with the f7-pawn, and the lines transpose into winning variations similar to the ones above.\n\n2.  **`g2g3`**: This is a solid prophylactic move. It creates an escape square for my king (`h2`) and challenges the black queen.\n    *   If Black plays `...d1=Q`, I can respond with `2. f7`. Now, if Black plays `...Qf3` to prevent a checkmate after I promote, I can play `3. f8=Q+ Rxf8 4. Qxf8+ Kxf8 5. Rxd1`, which is the same winning line as in the `f6f7` variation.\n    *   While this move also leads to a win, it is less direct than `f6f7`. In such a sharp position, the most forcing continuation is usually best as it minimizes the opponent's counter-chances.\n\n3.  **`Qd7` or `Qd8`**: These queen moves are tempting but flawed.\n    *   `Qd7` fails to `1...d1=Q 2. Qxd2 Qxg1+`, and Black wins.\n    *   `Qd8` allows `1...Qxg1+ 2. Kxg1 d1=Q+ 3. Kh2 Qxd8 4. f7 Rg7`, which leads to a perpetual check with `5. f8=Q+ Rg8 6. Qf6+`, forcing a draw. I am playing for a win.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe move `f6f7` is the most decisive. It forces the play, creates unstoppable threats, and leads to a winning position in all variations. It is the most clinical way to convert my advantage.\n\nf6f7"
