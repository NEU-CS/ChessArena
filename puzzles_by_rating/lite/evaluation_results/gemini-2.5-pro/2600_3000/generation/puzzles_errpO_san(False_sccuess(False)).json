If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

        "content": "This is a critical position for Black. White has a formidable attack brewing on the kingside with the Queen on h6, Knight on h5, and Rook on g3 all aimed at the Black king. The primary threats are `Nxg7`, removing a key defender, and `Qh7+`. Black must act precisely to neutralize this attack.\n\nLet's analyze the candidate moves for Black:\n\n1.  **`e4e3`**: This is a tempting counter-attacking move, but it is too slow. White can ignore it and proceed with a decisive attack: `22. Rxg7+ Kxg7 23. Qg5+ Kh8 24. Nf6`. This forces `24...Qxf6` (to prevent `Qh6#`), and after `25. Qxf6+ Kg8`, White's attack continues with `Rd3-g3+`, leading to a winning position for White.\n\n2.  **`f6e7`**: This move challenges the h5-knight. However, it fails tactically. After `22. Nxf6+ Bxf6 23. Qxf6`, Black's king is fatally exposed. For instance, `23... Kh7` is met by `24. Rg4`, and Black cannot stop the mate on h4 or g7 (e.g., `24...Rg8 25. Rh4#`).\n\n3.  **`f6d8`**: Similar to `f6e7`, this move tries to deal with the knight. However, it also fails to a direct attack: `22. Rxg7+ Kxg7 23. Qg5+ Kh7 24. Nf6+ Kh8 25. Qh6#`.\n\n4.  **`f6g5`**: This move attacks the White queen. While it forces a response, White can play `22. Qg6`, maintaining the pressure. Now Black's g7-knight is pinned, and the threat of `Rxg7+` is very strong. For example: `22... Qf7 23. Rxg7+ Qxg7 24. Qxg7+ Kxg7 25. Nf4`, and White wins the e4-pawn with a better endgame.\n\n5.  **`c7f7`**: This is the correct and by far the best move. It is a brilliant multi-purpose move that solves all of Black's problems.\n    *   It directly defends the g7-knight, neutralizing the `Nxg7` threat.\n    *   It defends the h7-square, stopping `Qh7+`.\n    *   It prepares to challenge the White queen on h6.\n    *   It keeps Black's pieces coordinated for defense and future counterplay.\n\nLet's look at White's most critical response: `22. Nxf6+`. Black must play `22... gxf6`, opening the g-file but removing the dangerous knight. After `23. Rg4+ Kh7`, White can try `24. Rd3` with the idea of `Rh3+`. However, Black has the stunning resource `24... f5!`. This move attacks the rook on g4 and opens the f-file for Black's own rook. If `25. Rh3+`, Black simply plays `25... Qh5`, and after the exchange, Black is up a piece and winning.\n\nAfter `21... Qf7`, White's attack is completely neutralized, and Black is ready to launch a counter-attack, often starting with the `...e3` pawn push.\n\nc7f7"
