When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "This is a critical position where both sides have powerful threats. I am playing as White.\n\n**Analysis of the position:**\n\n*   **White's Strengths:** My queen on f4 and bishop on h3 form a deadly attacking battery aimed at the Black king. My a4-pawn is a passed pawn and a long-term asset.\n*   **White's Weaknesses:** My king on g1 is under severe pressure. Black's queen on d3 and rooks on b2 and d2 create a formidable attack, with the immediate threat of ...Qxg2#.\n*   **Black's Strengths:** Black's queen and two rooks are perfectly coordinated to attack my king. The g4-pawn is a dangerous passed pawn that restricts my king and supports the attack.\n*   **Black's Weaknesses:** The Black king on e8 is exposed and vulnerable to my queen and bishop. The knight on e7 is the sole defender but is overworked.\n\n**Evaluation of threats:**\n\nBlack's most immediate and deadly threat is ...Qxg2#. I must address this. A purely defensive move like `g2g3` might seem logical, but it allows Black to continue the attack after `...gxh3`, removing my powerful bishop and leaving my king exposed. For example: `1. g2g3 gxh3 2. Qxh3 Qd1+ 3. Kg2` and Black's attack rages on.\n\nA more proactive approach is required. I must use my own threats, which are even faster than Black's. My queen and bishop are poised for a decisive blow.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n\n1.  **Qf7+**: This is the most forcing move. It's a check, and Black has only one legal response.\n    *   `1. Qf7+ Kd8`. Black's king is forced to d8.\n    *   Now, the killer follow-up is `2. Qe6!`. This brilliant move creates multiple unstoppable threats:\n        *   It attacks the knight on e7. If Black plays `2...gxh3` (to remove my bishop), I play `3. Qxe7#`, which is checkmate.\n        *   If Black tries to create counterplay with `2...Qd1+`, I play `3. Kg2`. Black still cannot stop the threat of `Qxe7#`. For instance, `3...gxh3 4. Qxe7#`.\n        *   If Black tries `2...g3` to create an escape square for the king, I play `3. Qxe7+ Kc8`, and now `4. Qb7#` is checkmate.\n    This line leads to a forced win for White.\n\n2.  **Qf6**: This is another very strong attacking move. It pins the e7 knight and threatens `Qf8+` followed by `Qd8#`.\n    *   If Black plays `1...gxh3`, I respond with `2. Qf8+ Kd7 3. Qd8#`.\n    *   If Black tries `1...Qd1+`, I play `2. Kg2`, and Black has no defense against the coming `Qf8+` and `Qd8#`.\n    This move is also winning, but `Qf7+` is slightly more direct as it's a check and limits Black's responses immediately.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth `Qf7+` and `Qf6` are winning moves. However, `Qf7+` is the most precise and forcing move. It initiates a sequence that leads to an unavoidable checkmate, leaving the opponent with no chance to complicate the position. I will play this move.\n\nf4f7"
