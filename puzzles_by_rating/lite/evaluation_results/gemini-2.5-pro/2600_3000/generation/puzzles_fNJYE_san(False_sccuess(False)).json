        "content": "This is a classic endgame position where precision is paramount. I am playing as White.\n\n**Position Evaluation:**\n\n*   **White's Assets:** The c2-pawn is a passed pawn on the verge of promotion. This is my primary winning advantage. My rook on c6 is actively placed, controlling the c-file and cutting off the Black king along the 6th rank. The h5-pawn is a secondary asset that can be used to create threats or as a decoy.\n*   **Black's Assets:** Black's rook on a2 is the main defensive piece, tying my king down to the defense of the c2-pawn. Black's king on f7 is relatively active and will try to assist the rook.\n*   **The Challenge:** My king is currently unable to support the c-pawn's advance to c1 because Black's rook can deliver a series of devastating checks from the side (e.g., `...Ra3+`, `...Ra4+`, etc.), leading to a perpetual check or forcing my king away.\n\n**Goal:**\n\nMy goal is to promote the c-pawn. To do this, I must find a way for my king to safely approach and support the pawn, neutralizing Black's checking threats.\n\n**Candidate Moves Analysis:**\n\n1.  **King Moves (`d2e3`, `d2d3`, `d2c3`):** Any immediate attempt to move the king closer to the pawn (e.g., `1. d2d3`) will be met by `1... Ra3`. This sets up a series of checks on the a-file (`...Ra4+`, `...Ra5+`) that my king cannot escape without abandoning the c-pawn. This leads to a draw by perpetual check. Therefore, direct king moves are insufficient.\n\n2.  **Rook Moves (`c6c7+`, `c6c8`):**\n    *   `1. c6c7+ Kg6`. After this check, if I try `2. Kd3`, Black again plays `2... Ra3+`, and we are back in the perpetual check scenario. The check on its own doesn't solve the core problem.\n    *   `1. c6c8` is a more subtle idea, preparing to meet `...Ra1` with `c3=Q`. However, Black can play `1... Kg6`, and if `2. Kd3`, we again face `2... Ra3+` and the perpetual check.\n\n3.  **Pawn Move (`h5h6`):** This move is the most promising because it creates a critical deflection. Black has two main responses:\n    *   **A) `1... gxh6`:** Black captures the pawn. This seems like a good trade, but it allows me to reposition my rook with tempo. I will play `2. Rc7+`. This check forces the Black king to a less optimal square (e.g., g6, f8, or e8). After the king moves, say to g6 (`2... Kg6`), I can begin my king's march: `3. Kd3`. Now, when Black starts checking with `3... Ra3+`, my king can advance: `4. Kc4 Ra4+ 5. Kb5`. The king is successfully approaching the pawn. The key winning idea comes after a few more checks: `...Rb1+ 7. Ka6 Ra1+ 8. Kb7 Rb1+`. Now, the crucial move is `9. Kc8!`. Because my rook is on c7 (not c6), my king can shelter on c8, protecting the pawn and the c7-square. From here, the pawn will inevitably promote.\n    *   **B) `1... Kg6`:** Black ignores the h-pawn and moves the king. This is a fatal error. I can now play the brilliant `2. h7!`. This pawn sacrifice is decisive. If Black plays `2... Kxh7`, his king is now on h7, completely out of the game. I can then play `3. Rc7+` followed by marching my king to support the c-pawn without any harassment from Black's rook. If Black tries `2... Ra1`, I simply promote with `3. h8=Q` and win easily.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe move `h5h6` is the only winning move. It forces a deflection of Black's king, either by capturing the pawn (which allows `Rc7+` to drive it away) or by moving towards the pawn (which allows the `h7` sacrifice). In either case, the path is cleared for my king to support the c-pawn's promotion, leading to a decisive victory. All other moves lead to a draw at best.\n\nh5h6"
