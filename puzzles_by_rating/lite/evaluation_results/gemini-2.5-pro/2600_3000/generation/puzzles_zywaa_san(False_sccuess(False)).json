If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

        "content": "This is a classic pawn endgame. I am playing as White.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n\n*   **White's Strengths:** The passed e-pawn on e5 is a major asset. My king on d2 is active and well-placed to both support my own pawn and stop Black's counterplay.\n*   **Black's Strengths:** The passed c-pawn on c4 is Black's only real hope. However, Black's king on g8 is too far away to influence the critical part of the board.\n*   **Strategic Goal:** My primary objective is to neutralize Black's c-pawn while simultaneously advancing my own e-pawn. The race is on, but my king's position gives me a decisive advantage.\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **Pawn Moves (g3g4, h2h3, f2f3, etc.):** These moves are too slow and do not address the core of the position, which is the race between the passed pawns. Making a pawn move would waste a critical tempo, allowing Black to advance the c-pawn and potentially complicate matters. These are incorrect.\n\n2.  **King Moves:** The king must be used to decide the game.\n    *   **d2e3:** This move brings the king closer to support the e-pawn. However, it allows Black to play `...c3`. After `1. Ke3 c3`, I would have to play `2. Kd3 c2 3. Kxc2`. While this is still winning, it allows Black's pawn to advance further than necessary and is less efficient.\n    *   **d2c2:** This is a strong move. It moves my king to attack the c-pawn. After `1. Kc2 c3`, I play `2. Kxc3`, eliminating Black's counterplay. My king is then free to march towards the kingside to support my e-pawn. This is a clear winning path.\n    *   **d2c3:** This is the most precise and forceful move. It directly attacks the c4-pawn, forcing Black's hand immediately.\n        *   If Black plays `...c3`, I respond with `bxc3`. Black's passed pawn is eliminated, and my king on c3 is perfectly positioned to move to d4, from where it will control the center and shepherd the e-pawn to promotion.\n        *   If Black tries to bring the king over with `...Kf7`, I simply play `Kxc4`, capturing the pawn and ending all of Black's hopes.\n        *   Any other move by Black is futile.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe move `d2c3` is the most accurate. It is the most active king move and immediately addresses Black's only threat. By forcing the issue with the c-pawn, I can resolve the queenside situation in my favor and then convert my own passed e-pawn into a win without any trouble.\n\n```\nd2c3\n```"
