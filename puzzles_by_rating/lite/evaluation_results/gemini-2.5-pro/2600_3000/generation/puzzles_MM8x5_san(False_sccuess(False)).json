When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "This is a critical position where White is on the verge of winning by checkmate, but Black has a deadly passed pawn on c2, just one square away from promotion. This means White must act with extreme precision and force. Any non-checking move will allow Black to play `...c1=Q`, which would likely lead to a loss for White. Therefore, the only viable plan is to launch a decisive mating attack.\n\nI am playing as White. My king is on h1, and my queen and bishop are poised to attack the exposed black king on f6. The key is to find a sequence of checks that leads to mate or wins the black queen, thus neutralizing the threat of the c2-pawn.\n\nLet's analyze the candidate moves, which must be checks:\n\n1.  **`Qd8+`**: This check allows the black king to escape to e5 (`...Ke5`). After `53...Ke5`, White can continue with `54. Qd4+ Kf5`, but the black king is getting away, and the win is no longer clear. This is not the most forceful continuation.\n\n2.  **`Qb6+`**: Similar to `Qd8+`, this allows `...Ke5`, complicating matters. It also allows `...f5`, after which the black king is safer.\n\n3.  **`Qa8+`**: This seems to be the most precise and powerful move. It forces a specific response from Black and initiates a forced mating sequence. Let's analyze the lines:\n    *   `53. Qa8+ Kg7` (This is Black's only reasonable move. `53...Ke7` leads to `54. Qe8#`, and `53...Kf7` leads to `54. Qf8#`.)\n    *   `54. Qf8+ Kg6` (Again, forced. `54...Kh7` is met by `55. Qg8#`.)\n    *   `55. Qf7+ Kg5` (Forced. If `55...Kh6`, White can play `56. g4!`. If Black promotes with `56...c1=Q`, White continues the attack with `57. g5+ Kh7 58. g6+ Kh6 59. Qh7+ Kg5 60. g7`, and White wins.)\n    *   `56. Qf5+ Kh4` (Forced. `56...Kg4` allows `57. Be2#`.)\n    *   `57. Qh7+ Kg5` (Forced.)\n    *   `58. h4+ Kg4` (Forced.)\n    *   `59. Be2+ Kg3` (Forced.)\n    *   `60. Qg5#`\n\nThis sequence demonstrates a forced checkmate. Since White has no time for slow moves due to the c2-pawn, this direct, forcing attack is the only way to win. The move `Qa8+` is the start of this winning combination.\n\nTherefore, the best move is `a5a8`.\n\n```\na5a8\n```"
