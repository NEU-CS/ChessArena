There are two legal moves to block the check:\n\n1.  **Re1**: This move blocks the check with the rook. However, this is a fatal blunder. Black's response is Qxd5. This removes my powerful bishop on d5, and I am still in check from the black rook on e1. The sequence would be:\n    *   1. Re1 Qxd5\n    *   2. Rxe1 (forced) Qxe1+ (forced)\n    *   3. Qf1 (forced) Qxf1+ (forced)\n    *   4. Kxf1\n    This leads to a pawn endgame where Black's connected passed pawns on the queenside are unstoppable. Black would have a decisive, winning advantage.\n\n2.  **Qf1**: This move blocks the check with the queen. This is the correct and winning move.\n    *   1. Qf1\n    Black's queen on d1 is now attacked by my queen on f1. Black's best course of action is to trade queens.\n    *   1... Qxd1+\n    *   2. Kxd1\n    After the queen trade, the resulting endgame is R+B vs. 3 pawns. While Black's queenside pawns (c4, b5, a6) are advanced and must be handled with care, my pieces are extremely active. The rook on e7 controls the 7th rank and puts pressure on Black's position, while the bishop on d5 is a very strong piece, controlling key squares. My king can move towards the queenside to help stop the pawns. This endgame is winning for White with precise play. Any other move by Black after Qf1 also leads to a winning position for White, as I can force the queen trade or win Black's queen.\n\nTherefore, Qf1 is the only move that not only saves the game but secures a winning advantage.\n\n```\nQf1\n```"
