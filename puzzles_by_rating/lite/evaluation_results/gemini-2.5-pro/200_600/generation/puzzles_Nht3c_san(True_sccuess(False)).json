        "content": "This is a critical position where both sides have active pieces. I am playing as White.\n\n**Position Evaluation:**\n*   **White's Strengths:** My rooks on b7 and e4 are extremely active. The rook on the 7th rank is a classic advantage, putting immense pressure on Black's position. The rook on e4 controls key squares and eyes the weak e6 pawn.\n*   **White's Weaknesses:** My primary weakness is my own back rank. A check on the first rank, like `...Rd1+`, would be fatal if my king had no escape.\n*   **Black's Strengths:** Black's bishop on e5 is a monster. It controls crucial diagonals, restricts my rooks, and puts pressure on my pawn structure. Black's rooks on d8 and f8 are well-placed for defense and potential counterplay.\n*   **Black's Weaknesses:** Black's king is somewhat exposed, and their own back rank is also a potential issue. The pawn on e6 is a target.\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\nMy main goal is to neutralize Black's primary threat (back-rank mate) while simultaneously increasing the pressure on their position. The best way to do this is to deal with the powerful bishop on e5.\n\n**Candidate Moves Analysis:**\n\n1.  **g3:** This move appears to be the strongest by a significant margin. It is a multi-purpose move that accomplishes several key objectives:\n    *   **Attacks the Bishop:** It directly attacks the strong bishop on e5, forcing it to move and disrupting Black's coordination.\n    *   **King Safety:** Crucially, it creates an escape square for my king on g2. After `g3`, a check like `...Rd1+` can be met with `Kg2`, completely solving my back-rank problem.\n    *   **Initiative:** It seizes the initiative, forcing Black to react to my threat rather than developing their own plans. If Black plays `...Bxc2?`, I can play the crushing `Rxe6!`, and Black's position collapses. If Black plays `...Rd1+`, I respond `Kg2`, and the bishop is still under attack. The most likely response is `...Bf6`, but then I have improved my position significantly.\n\n2.  **f4:** This also attacks the bishop. However, it is inferior to `g3` because it does not create an escape square for the king. It also weakens the e3-square and the long light-square diagonal.\n\n3.  **Rxe5:** This exchange sacrifice (`Rxe5 dxe5`) gives up too much material. While my remaining rook on b7 is strong, Black's two rooks would likely be enough to defend and create winning chances for themselves.\n\n4.  **c3:** This is a passive move. It prevents `...Bd4` but does nothing to solve my back-rank issue or challenge Black's setup. It gives Black a free tempo to improve their position, for example, with `...Rd2`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move `g3` is the clear best choice. It is a prophylactic move that secures my king's safety while also being an active, attacking move that challenges Black's best piece. It improves my position in every respect and puts Black on the defensive.\n\n```\ng3\n```"
