        "content": "The current position is a chess endgame. I am playing as White.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n*   **White:** I have two rooks against Black's rook, knight, and bishop. This is a significant material advantage, as two rooks are generally much stronger than a rook and two minor pieces, especially in an open position. My rook on a7 is a monster, controlling the 7th rank and putting immense pressure on Black's position. My other rook on c1 controls the c-file and is ready to join the attack. My king on g1 is relatively safe, but I must be mindful of potential back-rank threats.\n*   **Black:** Black's position is under severe pressure. The king on e7 is exposed. The knight on f7 is a key defender but is also a target. The bishop on c6 is active but also vulnerable. Black's main counterplay lies in the passed pawns on a4 and e4, and potential threats against my back rank with their rook on b3.\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\nMy goal is to convert my decisive material advantage into a win. The most effective strategy is to coordinate my rooks to create overwhelming threats, forcing the win of more material or a checkmate. I must be careful to neutralize Black's counterplay, particularly from the passed pawns and the active rook.\n\n**Candidate Moves:**\n\n1.  **Rc7:** This is the most powerful and decisive move. It doubles the rooks on the 7th rank and creates an immediate, crushing threat against the knight on f7. Black has no good way to defend.\n    *   If Black tries `...Ke8` or `...Ke6`, I will play `Raxf7`, winning the knight and leaving me with a rook against a bishop, which is an easy win.\n    *   If Black tries `...Rb2` to create counterplay, I can respond with `Raxf7+`. After `...Rxf7 Rxf7+ Ke6 Rxh7`, I have won a piece and am attacking the h-pawn. Black's counterplay with `...Rxf2` is insufficient, as my king can deal with the e-pawn, and my remaining rook can stop the a-pawn while my own passed h-pawn decides the game.\n    *   This move forces the issue and leads to a swift collapse of Black's position.\n\n2.  **Rxe7+:** This is another winning move. It removes the defending king with a check. After `Rxe7+ Kxe7`, I can play `Rxc6`, winning the bishop. This leads to a rook vs. knight endgame where I am up a clear exchange. While this is a winning position, it allows Black's king to become more active and gives Black some practical chances with the passed pawns, requiring precise technique to convert. `Rc7` is more direct and crushing.\n\n3.  **h3:** This is a useful prophylactic move that creates an escape square for my king, nullifying any back-rank threats. It's a solid move that prepares for future attacks like `Rc7`. However, it is slower than `Rc7`, which poses immediate problems that Black cannot solve. Given the strength of the direct attack, there is no need for this preparatory move.\n\n**Decision:**\n`Rc7` is the optimal move. It is the most forcing continuation, leveraging the full power of my two rooks to create an unstoppable attack on the 7th rank. It leads to a quick and decisive victory by winning material under the most favorable circumstances and shutting down Black's counterplay.\n\n```\nRc7\n```"
