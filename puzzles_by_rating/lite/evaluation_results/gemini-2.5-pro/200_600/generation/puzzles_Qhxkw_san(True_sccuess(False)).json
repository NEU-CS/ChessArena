        "content": "I am playing as White.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\nThe current position is an endgame where White has a significant positional advantage.\n*   **White's Strengths:** The bishop on c5 is a monster piece, dominating the board, restricting Black's pieces, and putting pressure on the weak e6 pawn. The rook on a1 controls the open a-file. The pawn on e4 gives White central space.\n*   **Black's Weaknesses:** Black's pieces are passive. The rook on b7 and pawn on c7 are somewhat awkwardly placed. The king on f7 is a bit exposed. The pawn on e6 is a long-term weakness. Black's main active piece is the knight on g6, which controls important squares like f4 and h4.\n*   **White's Plan:** My plan should be to consolidate my advantage, improve my king's safety, and systematically increase the pressure on Black's weak points. The primary strategic goal is to neutralize Black's counterplay, which mainly revolves around the g6-knight.\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **g3:** This is an excellent prophylactic move.\n    *   It creates an escape square (\"luft\") for the king on g2, preventing any future back-rank threats.\n    *   It takes the f4 square away from Black's knight, restricting its activity.\n    *   It prepares to challenge the knight further with a subsequent h4 pawn push.\n    *   This move improves White's position without creating any weaknesses, which is a key principle when holding an advantage. It is a safe, flexible, and strong move.\n\n2.  **e5:** This is a more aggressive and committal pawn break.\n    *   It directly attacks the knight on g6, forcing it to retreat to a more passive square like e7 or h8.\n    *   It establishes a powerful pawn on e5, cramping Black's position severely.\n    *   However, it is a committal move. The e5-pawn could potentially become a target later in the game. While it looks very strong, it might offer Black some long-term counter-chances if not followed up precisely.\n\n3.  **h3:** Similar to g3, this is a useful prophylactic move. It gives the king air and prepares to play g4 to attack the knight. It's a very good alternative to g3.\n\n**Decision:**\nWhile `e5` is tempting and likely very strong, `g3` is the most prudent and professional choice. It aligns perfectly with the strategy of playing with \"utmost caution\" and \"eliminating any chance of counterplay\". By playing `g3`, I improve my position significantly without taking any risks or creating any weaknesses. I deny Black's knight the key f4 square and make my king completely safe. After `g3`, I can continue to build pressure with moves like `h4` or `f4`, maintaining full control of the game. This slow but inexorable squeeze is the most effective way to convert this type of advantage.\n\n```\ng3\n```"
