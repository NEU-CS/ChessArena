When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in SAN or UCI notation (e.g., 'e4', 'Nf3' , 'exd5', 'Qh5+') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nFor example:\n```\ne4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.      \n"

        "content": "This is a dire situation for Black. The White queen on h6 delivers a check, and Black's king is severely exposed. I must respond to the check. The legal moves are `Ke8` and `Kg8`.\n\nLet's analyze the consequences of each move:\n\n1.  **`... Ke8`**: If the king moves to e8, White delivers an immediate checkmate with `Qh8#`. The White bishop on e6 prevents the Black rook on d7 from blocking on d8. This is mate in one.\n\n2.  **`... Kg8`**: If the king moves to g8, White can continue the attack. The most forcing continuation is `2. Qh8+`. Black's only legal response is `2... Kh7`. Now, White delivers checkmate with `3. Qg7#`. The queen on g7 is supported by the pawn on f6, and the bishop on e6 covers the h8 square. This is a mate in two.\n\nBoth legal moves lead to a forced checkmate. However, the instructions are to play the absolute best move. In a lost position, the best move is the one that prolongs the game for as long as possible, forcing the opponent to find the correct sequence.\n\n*   `... Ke8` leads to mate in 1.\n*   `... Kg8` leads to mate in 2.\n\nTherefore, `Kg8` is the superior move as it offers the most resistance, even though the outcome is inevitable.\n\n```\nKg8\n```"
