If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic.

This is a check.\n\n1.  **Analyze the check:** The king is attacked by the rook on f1. I must respond to this check. There are three ways to get out of check: move the king, block the check, or capture the checking piece.\n    *   **Move the king:** The squares h3 and g1 are also attacked by the rook on f1. The square h2 is attacked by the Black bishop on f4. The square h1 is attacked by the Black bishop on f4. There are no safe squares for the king to move to.\n    *   **Block the check:** There are no squares between my king on g2 and the Black rook on f1, so blocking is impossible.\n    *   **Capture the checking piece:** My king on g2 can capture the rook on f1.\n\n2.  **Identify Legal Moves:** Based on the analysis, there is only one legal move available to me: `Kxf1`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the position after the move:** After `Kxf1`, my king will be on f1. The immediate check is resolved, but my king remains exposed. Black's most dangerous threat is `...Be3+`, forcing my king to g1. This will be followed by a barrage of checks from the Black queen and rook (e.g., `...Qe1+`). While the position remains dangerous and requires precise defense, I have no alternative. Playing the only legal move is mandatory.\n\nTherefore, the move is forced.\n\n```\nKxf1\n```"
