My king on h1 is under direct attack from the Black queen on f1. This is a check.\n\n2.  **Analyze legal moves:** According to the rules of chess, when in check, a player must make a move that gets the king out of check. There are three ways to do this:\n    *   Move the king to a safe square.\n    *   Block the line of attack.\n    *   Capture the checking piece.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   **Move the king:** The king on h1 can only move to g1 or g2. The square g1 is attacked by the Black queen on f1. The square g2 is also attacked by the Black queen on f1. Therefore, the king cannot move.\n    *   **Block the check:** The check is along the f1-h1 diagonal. The only square to block on is g1. No White piece can legally move to g1.\n    *   **Capture the checking piece:** The Black queen on f1 can be captured by my queen on d1.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on the only move:** The only legal move for White is to capture the Black queen on f1 with the White queen from d1. In Standard Algebraic Notation (SAN), this move is `Qxf1`.\n\n5.  **Strategic Assessment:** Before Black's last move (`...Qf1+`), White was in a desperate situation, likely lost due to the material deficit (White is missing a rook). Black's move is a significant blunder. It allows White to force a queen trade and relieve all the pressure. After the forced sequence `Qxf1 Rxf1+ Bxf1`, the material becomes equal (Rook, Bishop, Knight vs. Rook, Knight), and White's position is solid, if not slightly better, due to the strong pawn on c5. Playing `Qxf1` is not only the sole legal move but also a game-saving one, turning a lost position into a playable endgame.\n\nTherefore, the decision is straightforward and forced.\n\n```\nQxf1\n```"
