My king on e8 is under check from the White queen on h5.\n\nThis is a critical position. White has a powerful attack brewing with the queen on h5, the knight on e5, and the rooks doubled on the g-file. My king's safety is the paramount concern. I must choose my move very carefully from the four legal options: `Kf8`, `Kd8`, `Rxh5`, and `Qf7`.\n\n1.  **`Rxh5`**: This move captures the attacking queen, but at the cost of the exchange. After `27... Rxh5 28. Nxh5`, White's knight on h5 replaces the queen as a major attacking piece, eyeing the g7 square. White's attack continues relentlessly, for example, with `28... Qf7 29. Rg7 Qe8 30. R1g1`, and my position remains extremely difficult, if not worse than before. Giving up the rook for the knight does not solve my problems.\n\n2.  **`Kd8`**: Moving the king to d8 seems logical to escape the h5-e8 diagonal and the g-file. However, after `27... Kd8`, White can play the crushing `28. Rg7!`, attacking my queen on e6. If I move the queen, for instance with `28... Qe8`, White plays `29. Rg8`, pinning and winning my queen. Other queen moves also lead to a collapse. This move walks into a decisive attack.\n\n3.  **`Qf7`**: This move blocks the check, but it allows White to intensify the attack with `28. Ng6+!`. After the forced `28... hxg3`, White plays `29. R1xg3`, and the threats against my king (e.g., `R7g7`) are overwhelming. My position would be indefensible.\n\n4.  **`Kf8`**: This is the most resilient and best defensive move. It moves the king out of check and away from the dangerous g-file. White's most challenging replies are `28. Rg7` and `28. Ng6+`.\n    *   If `28. Rg7`, I must play `28... Qf6` (as `28... Qe8` allows `29. Ng6+` with a devastating attack). This leads to the line `29. Rg8+ Kf7 30. R1g7+ Qxg7 31. Rxg7+ Kxg7`. I emerge down the exchange in an endgame (Rook vs. Knight). While White has a significant advantage, the immediate mating threats are gone, and I have practical chances to defend and fight for a draw.\n    *   If `28. Ng6+`, after `28... hxg3 29. R1xg3`, I can again try `29... Qf6`, leading to a difficult endgame where White is better but has to prove the win.\n\nIn all variations, my position is very difficult. However, `Kf8` is the only move that does not lead to an immediate forced loss or mate. It forces White to demonstrate technical skill to convert the advantage in a complex endgame, thus maximizing my chances of survival. It is the move of maximum resistance.\n\nTherefore, I choose `Kf8`.\n\n```\nKf8\n```"
