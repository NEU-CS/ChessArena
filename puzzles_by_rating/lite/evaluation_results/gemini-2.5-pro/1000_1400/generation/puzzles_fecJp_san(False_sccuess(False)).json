If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

        "content": "This is a critical position for Black. My king on e7 is in check from the White knight on g6. This knight is a monster, forking the king and the rook on h8. It is supported by the White queen on h5. Additionally, the White bishop on c4 puts immense pressure on my f7 pawn and the entire kingside. I must respond to the check.\n\nLet's analyze my legal moves:\n\n1.  **King moves (`e7e8`, `e7f7`, `e7d7`, `e7e6`, `e7d6`)**:\n    *   `e7e8`: This move seems safe at first glance, but it's a blunder. White will simply play `2. Nxh8`, winning my rook. White's attack continues unabated, and I'll be down significant material.\n    *   `e7f7`: This moves my king into a discovered attack from the bishop on c4. White will play `2. Bxd5+`, and if I reply `2...Qxd5`, White plays `3. Nxd5`, winning my queen. This is a losing line.\n    *   `e7d7`: This also runs into `2. Bxd5`. If `2...cxd5`, White's queen can swing over with `3. Qxh7`, and the attack is overwhelming. If `2...Qxd5`, `3. Nxd5` again wins my queen. This is also losing.\n    *   `e7e6` and `e7d6`: These moves expose my king even more dangerously in the center of the board. They are quickly losing to moves like `Bxd5+`.\n\n2.  **Capture (`h7g6`)**:\n    *   `h7g6`: This is the only move that addresses the root of the problem: the knight on g6. By capturing it, I eliminate the immediate check and the threat to my h8 rook.\n    *   The forced sequence is `1... hxg6 2. Qxg6`. White's queen replaces the knight, maintaining pressure. However, my position has improved significantly. The immediate threat is gone, and I have new defensive resources.\n    *   After `2. Qxg6`, my best reply is `2... Ne5`. This crucial move attacks the dangerous bishop on c4, forces White to react, and brings my knight to a fantastic defensive square where it helps control f7 and d7.\n    *   For example, after `1... hxg6 2. Qxg6 Ne5`, if White plays `3. Bb3`, I can continue with `3... Be6`, solidifying my position. If White tries `3. Bxd5+`, I can play `3... Qxd5`, and my position is tenable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll the king moves lead to a swift loss of material or an indefensible position. The only move that allows Black to survive and fight on is capturing the knight. It resolves the most severe threats and gives me a chance to consolidate my defenses. Therefore, `h7g6` is the only correct and best move.\n\n```\nh7g6\n```"
