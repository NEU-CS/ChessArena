When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "This is a highly tactical and sharp position. I am playing as White. My king on h3 is under severe attack from Black's queen on f2 and rook on e3. The immediate threat is ...Re2+ followed by ...Qf1#, or just ...Qf1# if my bishop on f3 moves. For example, a quiet move like `b3b4` would be met by `1... Re2+ 2. Kh2 Qf1#`. Therefore, I must make a forcing move.\n\nMy queen on g7 is a powerful attacking piece, and my passed d-pawn is a major asset. The best way to proceed is to use my queen to give a series of checks, forcing the Black king into a more vulnerable position and creating unstoppable threats with my d-pawn.\n\nLet's analyze the candidate checks:\n\n1.  **Qf6+**: This is a strong move.\n    *   If `1... Kc7`, it transposes into lines similar to other checks.\n    *   If `1... Ke5`, then `2. d6+ Kxd6 3. Qd8+` begins a king hunt that appears decisive.\n    *   If `1... Kc5`, then `2. d6` is very powerful, and Black's counterplay with `2... Re2+` can be met by `3. Kh4`.\n\n2.  **Qe5+**: Also a good check, leading to similar variations where I can push my d-pawn or hunt the king.\n\n3.  **Qf8+**: This is the most forcing move. It gives the Black king only one legal response.\n    *   `1. Qf8+ Kc7` (The only move, as `1... Ke6` leads to `2. Qe7#`).\n    *   Now, I must continue the attack relentlessly. The best follow-up is `2. Qe7+`. This forces the Black king to choose between `Kc8`, `Kd8`, or `Kc6`.\n        *   If `2... Kc8` or `2... Kd8`, my response is `3. d6!`. This move is crushing. It threatens `d7+` and `Qc7+`. Black's main counterplay ideas are:\n            *   The perpetual check attempt with `3... Qf1+ 4. Kg3 Qe1+ 5. Kh2 Qf2+` is refuted by `6. Bg2!`, which ends the checks and leaves White with a winning position.\n            *   The counterattack with `3... Re2+` is met by the crucial `4. Kh4!`. My king escapes the immediate danger, and after a move like `4... Qf4+`, I can play `5. g5`, solidifying my position and maintaining the winning attack.\n        *   If `2... Kc6`, I can play `3. Qe6+`. If Black plays `3... Kc7`, I can transpose to the winning lines above with `4. Qf7+ Kd8 5. Qe7+`. If Black plays `3... Kb5`, I can play `4. d6!`, and again, the threat of the d-pawn combined with my queen's attack is decisive.\n\nComparing the options, `Qf8+` is the most precise. By forcing Black's response, it simplifies the calculation and leads to a clear, undeniable winning path. It eliminates any chance for Black to find a tricky defense that might exist against less forcing moves.\n\nTherefore, I will play `Qf8+`.\n\n```\ng7f8\n```"
