I have only two legal moves to get out of check: `h8g8` and `h8g7`. I must carefully evaluate the consequences of each move.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Moves:**\n\n1.  **`h8g8`**: This move seems passive and dangerous. The king moves to g8, where it remains on the back rank and is highly vulnerable to White's powerful attack.\n    *   After `1... Kg8`, White's most potent reply is `2. Qh6`. This move creates a devastating threat of checkmate.\n    *   For instance, if Black tries to block with `2... Nf5`, White plays `3. Bxf5`. Black must recapture with `3... exf5`, which is then met by `4. Qh7#`.\n    *   If Black tries `2... f5`, White can play `3. exf5`, and the attack continues with overwhelming force. The king on g8 is a sitting duck. This line leads to a lost position for Black.\n\n2.  **`h8g7`**: This move involves capturing the checking piece, the bishop on g7. This is an active and much better response.\n    *   `1... Kxg7`. By capturing the bishop, I remove a key attacking piece from the board.\n    *   White's most forcing response is `2. Qh7+`. This is the only move that continues the attack effectively.\n    *   I am forced to play `2... Kf6`. My king is now on f6. While this looks exposed, the king has become an active piece, escaping the deadly h-file and participating in its own defense.\n    *   From here, the position is complex, but Black has excellent chances to survive and even fight for an advantage.\n        *   If White continues with checks, e.g., `3. Qh6+ Kf7 4. Qh5+`, I can either accept a perpetual check with `4... Kg8` (a draw, which is a great result from this dangerous position) or try to escape with the king via `4... Ke6`, where my active pieces can support the king's journey to safety.\n        *   If White tries to open lines with `3. f4`, I have the brilliant counter `3... f5!`. This move challenges White's bishop on e4, controls key squares, and solidifies my position. After `3... f5`, Black is doing very well.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe move `h8g8` leads to a passive and losing position. The move `h8g7` is an active defense that removes an attacker, activates the king, and gives Black excellent chances to save the game, either by forcing a draw via perpetual check or by outplaying White in the ensuing complex middlegame. Therefore, `h8g7` is the only correct and best move.\n\n```\nh8g7\n```"
