When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

This means I am in check. I must make a move to get my king out of check.\n\nLet's analyze the possible ways to escape the check:\n1.  **Move the king:** The king can move to c8, c7, e7, or d6.\n    *   c8 is controlled by the White knight on e6.\n    *   c7 is controlled by the White knight on e6.\n    *   e7 is controlled by the White knight on e6.\n    *   d6 is occupied by the attacking rook. I can capture it.\n\n2.  **Block the check:** There are no pieces that can move between the rook on d6 and my king on d7.\n\n3.  **Capture the attacking piece:** My king on d7 can capture the rook on d6.\n\nBased on this analysis, the only legal move available to me is to capture the rook on d6 with my king. Any other move is illegal because it would leave my king in check.\n\nThe provided list of legal moves confirms this: `d7d6`.\n\nTherefore, my only choice is to play `Kxd6`. This move, while forced, is the only one that continues the game. After `1...Kxd6`, White will likely continue the attack with `2. Qe5+` or `2. Nf8+`, leading to a very difficult, likely losing, position for me. However, since it is the only legal move, it is by definition the best move.\n\n```\nd7d6\n```"
