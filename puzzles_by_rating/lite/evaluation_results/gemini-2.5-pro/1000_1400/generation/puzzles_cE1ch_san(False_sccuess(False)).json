If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

        "content": "This is a critical moment in the game. I am playing as Black. My king on h5 is under direct attack from the White queen on f5. I must move my king to a safe square. The only legal moves are `h5h6` and `h5h4`.\n\n**Analysis of the Position:**\n*   **Black's Strengths:** My queen on d2, rook on b8, and bishop on b6 are perfectly coordinated to attack the exposed White king on a4. The primary threat is a mating attack starting with `Ra8+`.\n*   **White's Strengths:** White's queen on f5 is a major attacking piece. The passed pawn on g6 is a significant threat, just two squares from promotion.\n*   **Overall:** The position is a delicate balance. Both kings are in peril. White is checking me, but if they are not careful, my counter-attack will be decisive.\n\n**Candidate Move 1: `h5h4`**\nMoving my king to h4 escapes the check.\n*   If White tries to win by pushing the pawn with `2. g7`, I have a forced checkmate: `2... Ra8+ 3. Kb3 Qa2+ 4. Kc3 Qa3+ 5. Kb4 Qb2+ 6. Ka5 Ra5#`. This is a decisive win for me.\n*   However, a careful opponent will not play `2. g7`. Instead, White can force a draw by perpetual check. For example: `2. Qf7+ Kg3 3. Qf3+ Kh2 4. Qf2+ Kh1 5. Qf1+ Kh2`, and the game is a draw by repetition. Another perpetual check is `2. Qh7+ Kg4 3. Qh3+` etc.\n\n**Candidate Move 2: `h5h6`**\nMoving my king to h6 also escapes the check.\n*   Similarly to the other line, if White plays `2. g7`, I have the exact same forced checkmate: `2... Ra8+ 3. Kb3 Qa2+ 4. Kc3 Qa3+ 5. Kb4 Qb2+ 6. Ka5 Ra5#`.\n*   And again, White can force a draw by perpetual check if they play correctly: `2. Qf7+ Kh7 3. Qf8+ Kh6`, leading to a draw by repetition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth `h5h4` and `h5h6` lead to the same two outcomes.\n1.  If White makes the mistake of pushing the g-pawn (`g7`) or moving their king carelessly (`Ka3`), I deliver a forced checkmate.\n2.  If White plays correctly, they can force a draw by perpetual check.\n\nSince the tactical outcome is identical for both moves, the choice is a matter of preference. The move `h5h6` places my king on the edge of the board, which is generally considered a safer location than h4. It keeps the king further from the center and White's active queen. While both moves are objectively equal (leading to a draw with best play), `h5h6` is the more prudent choice, maintaining all threats while placing the king on a slightly more secure square. It forces White to find the precise sequence for a draw, otherwise they lose immediately.\n\nTherefore, I will play `h5h6`.\n\n```\nh5h6\n```"
