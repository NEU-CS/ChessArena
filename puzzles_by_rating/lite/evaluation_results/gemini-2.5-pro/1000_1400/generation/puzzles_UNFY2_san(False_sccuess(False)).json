        "content": "This is a critical endgame. I am playing as Black. My main advantage is the passed pawn on c3, which is two squares away from promotion. My opponent's (White's) only hope is to use their powerful queen on g8 to deliver a perpetual check or a checkmate against my king on e6. My task is to find a safe square for my king, neutralize the checking threats, and then proceed to win the game by promoting the c-pawn.\n\nLet's analyze the legal moves for my king:\n\n1.  **e6f5**: This move walks my king into a checkmate trap. After `...Kf5`, White plays `Qg5#`. The White queen on g5 attacks the king, and all escape squares (e4, e5, f6, g4) are controlled by White's pieces (f3-pawn, d5-pawn, queen, and h3-king respectively). This move loses instantly and must be avoided.\n\n2.  **e6d6**: This move brings the king closer to the queenside, which is the correct general idea. However, it's too direct and exposes the king to immediate and dangerous checks. For example, after `...Kd6`, White can play `Qg7+`. Now if I play `...Kc5`, my king and queen are on the same file, allowing `Qe5+`, forcing my king into the open where White has many ways to continue checking. This path is unnecessarily risky.\n\n3.  **e6d7**: This is a plausible move. The king moves towards the queenside, preparing to support the c-pawn from c7. However, after `...Kd7`, White can play `Qg7+`. My king is forced to `...Kc8`. Now my king is on the back rank, which can be dangerous. White can continue with checks like `Qe7+` or `Qd7+`, and while it might not be a forced draw, it gives White significant counterplay and complicates my task.\n\n4.  **e6e7**: This is the most precise and safest move. It moves the king away from the immediate checking lines of the White queen, particularly from the g-file. After `...Ke7`, my king is ready to step to d6 on the next move, from where it can go to c7 to support the c3-pawn. Let's look at White's responses:\n    *   If White plays `Qe8+`, I respond with `...Kd6`. Now my king is actively placed, and after `Qd8+`, I play `...Kc7`. My king now defends the c3-pawn, and is ready to escape via b6. White is running out of useful checks, and my c-pawn will soon decide the game.\n    *   If White plays `Qg7+`, I again respond with `...Kd6`. This transposes to a similar, favorable position. My king is safe and active, and White's perpetual check threats are neutralized.\n\nComparing the options, `e6e7` is clearly the superior choice. It is the safest path, systematically improving my king's position while preparing to support the winning pawn. It shuts down White's counterplay most effectively.\n\n```\ne6e7\n```"
