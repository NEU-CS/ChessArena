When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

The White queen on h7 delivers a check. This is a very dangerous situation.\n2.  **White's Attack:** White's queen on h7 and bishop on g6 form a powerful attacking battery aimed at my kingside. The pawn on g4 supports the bishop and restricts my king. White's pieces are perfectly coordinated for a decisive attack.\n3.  **My Defensive Resources:** My knight on e6 is a crucial defender, controlling the g7 and f8 squares. My rook on e7 is currently attacked by the bishop on g6. My bishop on h1, while awkwardly placed, does control the g2 square, which could be relevant if the White king needs to move.\n4.  **Material:** The material is equal.\n\n**Evaluation of Legal Moves:**\nThe list of legal moves provided is `g8f8`.\nThe White queen on h7 is checking my king on g8. I must move my king out of check.\n*   Moving to h8 is illegal due to the White queen on h7.\n*   Moving to f7 is illegal due to the White bishop on g6.\n*   Capturing the queen on h7 is not possible.\n*   Blocking the check is not possible as the queen is adjacent to the king.\n\nTherefore, the only legal move is to move the king to f8.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince `g8f8` is the only legal move, it is forced. There are no other options to consider. I must play this move to continue the game, even though the position remains extremely difficult for Black. After `...Kf8`, White will likely continue the attack with moves like `Bxf7` or `Qh8+`, and I will have to find the best defense to survive. But for this turn, the choice is made for me.\n\ng8f8"
