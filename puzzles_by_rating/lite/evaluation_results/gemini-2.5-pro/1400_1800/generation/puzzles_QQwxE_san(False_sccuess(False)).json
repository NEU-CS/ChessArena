When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "I am playing as Black.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\nThe current position is overwhelmingly in Black's favor. My pieces are extremely active and well-coordinated, posing numerous threats to the White king.\n*   The knight on e5 is a monster, controlling key squares and ready to jump into the attack.\n*   The queen on f4 puts immense pressure on White's kingside and center.\n*   The rook on c4 controls the open c-file and is poised to infiltrate White's position.\n*   The passed pawn on b4 is a major strategic asset, threatening to break open the king's pawn cover.\n*   The bishop on b7 adds to the pressure along the long diagonal.\n\nWhite's position is passive and defensive. The king on b1 is vulnerable, the queen on g1 is tied down to defensive duties, and the rook on d1 is under pressure. White's only active piece is the bishop on f5, but it is not enough to counter Black's overwhelming threats.\n\nMy goal is to find the most direct and forceful continuation to convert this advantage into a win, aiming for a swift checkmate.\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **b4b3**: This is a powerful breakthrough move. It directly attacks the pawn structure protecting the white king.\n    *   If White plays `axb3` or `cxb3`, my response `Rxc2` is devastating. For example: `1... b4b3 2. axb3 Rxc2!`. If `3. Kxc2`, then `Qf2+` leads to a quick mate. If White tries to defend, the attack remains overwhelming.\n    *   This move creates unstoppable threats and forces a collapse of White's position. It is the most direct path to victory.\n\n2.  **e5f3+**: This is also a very strong, likely winning move. It's a check that forces a response.\n    *   `1... e5f3+ 2. gxf3 Qxf3`. This exposes the white king completely. Black can follow up with moves like `b4b3` or `Bxe4`, leading to a decisive advantage. While winning, it might be slightly less direct than `b4b3`.\n\n3.  **b7e4**: This move appears to win a pawn, but it allows White significant counterplay and a likely perpetual check after `2. Qxe4 Qxe4 3. Rd8+ Kf7 4. Rf8+ Ke7` etc. This would be a grave error, throwing away a winning position for a draw.\n\n**Decision:**\nAfter careful consideration, `b4b3` is the most clinical and ruthless move. It shatters the defenses around the white king and initiates a forced mating sequence or a decisive material gain. It leaves White with no good answers and perfectly embodies the principle of relentlessly pressing a winning advantage.\n\nb4b3"
