If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one.

I am playing as Black.\n\nMy king on e8 is under direct attack from the White bishop on f7. I have only two legal moves to escape the check: `e8f8` and `e8d8`. I must carefully evaluate which move is safer.\n\n1.  **Analyze `e8f8`:**\n    This move seems intuitive, keeping the king on the kingside. However, it leads to a forced checkmate.\n    *   `1... Kf8`\n    *   White responds with `2. Bh6+`. The bishop on g5 moves to h6, delivering a check. The queen on g4 supports this bishop.\n    *   My only legal move is to capture the bishop: `2... Nxh6`.\n    *   White recaptures with the queen: `3. Qxh6+`. This is another check.\n    *   My only escape square is g8: `3... Kg8`.\n    *   Now, White delivers the final blow: `4. Qg7#`. The queen on g7 is protected by the knight on e5, and my king has no escape squares.\n    Therefore, `e8f8` is a fatal mistake.\n\n2.  **Analyze `e8d8`:**\n    This move takes the king towards the center and away from the immediate kingside attack.\n    *   `1... Kd8`\n    *   This move successfully gets the king out of check.\n    *   Crucially, it moves the king off the e-file, which unpins my knight on f6 from my queen on d6. The knight is now free to move, which is a significant defensive improvement.\n    *   My king is safer on d8 than on f8. While White still has a strong attack, the immediate mating threats are neutralized.\n    *   After `1... Kd8`, White might continue with moves like `Bxe7+` or `Nxg6`.\n        *   If `2. Bxe7+`, I will play `2... Qxe7`. I have traded my defending bishop, but my queen is now active, my king is safer, and I have survived the crisis.\n        *   If `2. Nxg6`, the position becomes very complex. `2... hxg6 3. Qxh1` wins the exchange for White, but I get some counterplay. However, I have the critical reply `2... Qe6!`, which defends the h8 rook and attacks the g6 knight. This complicates matters for White and gives me good fighting chances.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move `e8f8` leads to a forced checkmate and must be avoided at all costs. The move `e8d8` is the only move that allows me to survive the immediate attack and continue the game. It is the only correct choice.\n\ne8d8"
