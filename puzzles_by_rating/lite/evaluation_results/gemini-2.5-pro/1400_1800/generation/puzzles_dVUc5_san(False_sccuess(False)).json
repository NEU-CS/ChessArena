If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White.

        "content": "This is a critical position where both kings are under attack. I am playing as Black, and my king on g6 is currently in check by the White Queen on e6. I must move my king.\n\nLet's analyze the legal moves:\n\n1.  **`g6g5`**: This move places my king on a very exposed square. White can continue the attack with `Qe7+`. If I play `...Kh4`, White has `g3#`. If I play `...Kh5`, White plays `Qf7+`, and my king is caught in a mating net. This move is losing.\n\n2.  **`g6h5`**: This move also puts my king in a precarious position. White can force a draw by perpetual check with `2. Qf7+ Kh6 3. Qf6+ Kh5`, repeating the position. If I want to win, I should avoid this. However, it's better than losing.\n\n3.  **`f2f6`**: This move blocks the check with my powerful rook. However, it gives up a key attacking piece. After `1... f2f6`, White will play `2. Qxf6+`. I must then play `...Kh7`. White can then continue with `3. Rxb7`, and while the position is complex, my attack has lost its primary force (the rook on the 2nd rank), and White's threats are now very serious. This line seems to give up the advantage.\n\n4.  **`g6h7`**: This is the most promising move. My king moves to a safer square, h7. More importantly, it unleashes a decisive attack on the White king. After `1... Kh7`, I am threatening `...Qh2#`. Let's see how White can defend:\n    *   White can give a check with `2. Qe4+` (or `Qf5+`). I simply reply with `...Kg8`. Now White has no more checks, and the threat of `...Qh2#` is still on the board.\n    *   To stop `...Qh2#`, White must control the h2 square.\n        *   If `2. Qe1` or `2. Qe2`, I play `...Rf1+`. White is forced to capture with `3. Qxf1`, and I deliver checkmate with `...Qxf1#`.\n        *   If `2. Qg4`, I play `...Qxg4`. After `3. hxg4`, I deliver mate with `...Rf1#`.\n        *   If `2. g4`, I play `...Qxg4+`. After `3. Kh2`, I deliver mate with `...Rf1#`.\n\nIn all variations after `1... Kh7`, White has no adequate defense against my mating threats. This move sidesteps the check to my own king while creating an unstoppable attack. It is the winning move.\n\nTherefore, the best move is `g6h7`.\n\n```\ng6h7\n```"
