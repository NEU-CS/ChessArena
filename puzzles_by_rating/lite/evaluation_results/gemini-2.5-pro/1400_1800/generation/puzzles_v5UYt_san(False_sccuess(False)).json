When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "This is a critical position where White has a powerful attack against the Black king. I am playing as White. The key is to find the most precise and forceful continuation to secure a quick victory and prevent any counterplay.\n\n**Position Evaluation:**\n*   **White's Advantages:** My knights on h7 and h4, along with the queen on f2 and the pawn on g5, are creating a formidable attacking force aimed directly at the Black king on h8. The pawn on e5 severely restricts Black's pieces. My rooks are ready to join the attack.\n*   **Black's Disadvantages:** The Black king is extremely exposed. The f7 and g6 pawns are weak points. The bishop on f8 is paralyzed by my knight on h7. The rook on a8 is not participating in the defense.\n*   **Black's Counterplay:** Black's main active pieces are the queen on b6, the rook on c3, and the knight on g4. The knight on g4 is particularly dangerous as it eyes my king and queen. I must calculate carefully to ensure Black has no saving tactical shots.\n\n**Candidate Moves Analysis:**\n\nThe position screams for a decisive, sacrificial combination. The most promising moves involve attacking the f6 square, a critical defensive point for Black.\n\n1.  **Nxf6+ (h7f6):** This is a very strong candidate. It's a forcing check.\n    *   `25. Nxf6+ gxf6` (This is Black's only legal move).\n    *   `26. Qxf6+` Now my queen takes over the attack on the same square.\n    *   `26...Kg8` (or `26...Kg7`).\n    *   `27. Qf7+ Kh8` (forced).\n    *   `28. Ng6#`. This is a clean, forced checkmate in 4 moves. It leaves Black with no options at any stage.\n\n2.  **Qxf6+ (f2f6):** This is another powerful, forcing check, and a potential queen sacrifice.\n    *   **Case A: Black accepts the sacrifice.** `25...gxf6`.\n        *   `26. Nxf6+` (The knight from h7 checks). Black's king must move.\n        *   If `26...Kg7` or `26...Kh7`, my other knight delivers mate: `27. Nfg8#`. This is a checkmate in 3 moves.\n    *   **Case B: Black declines the sacrifice.** `25...Kg7`.\n        *   This is Black's best attempt to prolong the game. However, my attack continues.\n        *   `26. Nxf8!` This move wins the bishop and renews the mating threats.\n        *   `26...Rxf8` (to prevent immediate mate).\n        *   `27. Qf7+ Kh8` (forced).\n        *   `28. Ng6#`. This is also a forced checkmate, this time in 4 moves.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBoth `Nxf6+` and `Qxf6+` lead to a forced checkmate.\n*   `Nxf6+` forces mate in 4 moves, regardless of Black's play (`25. Nxf6+ gxf6 26. Qxf6+ Kg8 27. Qf7+ Kh8 28. Ng6#`).\n*   `Qxf6+` leads to mate in 3 if the queen is taken (`25...gxf6`), and mate in 4 if the king moves (`25...Kg7`).\n\nSince `Qxf6+` offers the possibility of an even quicker mate and is equally decisive in the other variation, it is the most clinical and aesthetically pleasing move. It immediately poses the maximum problem for the opponent. I will play `Qxf6+`.\n\nf2f6"
