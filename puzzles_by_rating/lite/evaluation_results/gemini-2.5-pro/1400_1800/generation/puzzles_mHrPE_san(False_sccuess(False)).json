When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "This is a critical position where I, as White, am in immediate danger. My king on d1 is in check from the Black queen on f2. I must respond to this check. The legal moves are `c4e2`, `g1f3`, and `g1e2`. I need to determine which of these moves offers the best chance of survival.\n\n**Analysis of Candidate Moves:**\n\n1.  **`g1e2`**: This move blocks the check by placing the knight on e2. However, Black can immediately play `...g4xe2+`, delivering a discovered check from their bishop. My only legal response is `Ke1`. After `1. g1e2 g4xe2+ 2. Ke1`, Black plays `...Qf1#`. The queen on f1 is protected by the bishop on e2, and my king on e1 has no escape squares. This is a forced checkmate in 2 moves.\n\n2.  **`c4e2`**: This move blocks the check by placing my bishop on e2. Similar to the previous move, Black will respond with `...g4xe2+`. Again, my only move is `Ke1`. This leads to the exact same position as the `g1e2` line: `1. c4e2 g4xe2+ 2. Ke1 Qf1#`. This is also a forced checkmate in 2 moves.\n\n3.  **`g1f3`**: This move blocks the check by placing the knight on f3. Black's most forcing reply is to capture the knight with `...g4xf3+`, delivering check with the bishop. Now, my king must move to `e2`. The sequence is `1. g1f3 g4xf3+ 2. Ke2`.\n    Unlike the other two lines, this is **not** an immediate checkmate. My king on e2 now has an escape square on d3. While Black is still completely winning and has a crushing attack (for example, with `...O-O-O` or `...Qf1+`), the game is not over on the spot. I have avoided the immediate mate and forced my opponent to continue finding the correct moves to win.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth `g1e2` and `c4e2` lead to a forced checkmate in 2 moves. The move `g1f3` is the only one that avoids immediate mate and prolongs the game, offering the most resistance. In a lost position, the best move is the one that makes the opponent's task the most difficult. Therefore, `g1f3` is the superior choice.\n\n```\ng1f3\n```"
