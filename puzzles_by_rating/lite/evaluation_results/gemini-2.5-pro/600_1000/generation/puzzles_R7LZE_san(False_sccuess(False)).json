When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

However, White's king on d1 is vulnerable. My queen on a4 is very active and poses a major threat. The key to finding the best move is to correctly balance defense against the Ne6 with an attack on the White king.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the most forcing and tactical candidate moves:\n\n1.  **`f6e4`**: This is a very tempting move.

White's queen is attacked, and they cannot play `3. dxe6` because of the devastating `3...Qxe4+`, which leads to a checkmate or a winning attack (e.g., `4. Kb1 Qxc2#` or `4. Kd2 Qd5+`). Therefore, White must move the queen, for instance to f3. Then after `3. Qf3 Rxe6 4. dxe6 Qxf3 5. gxf3 Nxf2`, I win a pawn and shatter"
