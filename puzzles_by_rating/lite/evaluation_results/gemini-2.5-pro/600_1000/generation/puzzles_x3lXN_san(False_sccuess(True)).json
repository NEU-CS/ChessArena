When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

        "content": "This is a critical position for White. My king on g1 is in check from the black bishop on h2. I must move my king. The only legal moves are `g1f1` and `g1h1`.\n\n1.  **Analyze `g1f1`:**\n    This move appears to be a fatal error. Let's trace the consequences:\n    *   `28. g1f1`\n    *   Black will respond with the crushing sequence of exchanges on e1: `28... Rxe1+`\n    *   `29. Rxe1 Rxe1+`\n    *   `30. Qxe1`\n    *   Now, Black delivers checkmate with `30... Qf1#`. The queen on f1 is supported by the knight on f6. My king on e1 has no escape squares: d1 is covered by the rook on d6, and f2 is covered by the knight on f6. Playing `g1f1` leads to a forced checkmate.\n\n2.  **Analyze `g1h1`:**\n    This is the only other legal move. It moves the king to the corner, away from the immediate check.\n    *   `28. g1h1`\n    *   White is still in a very difficult, likely lost, position. Black's attack is powerful. Black has several strong continuations.\n    *   One of the most obvious lines is `28... Rxe1+`. After `29. Rxe1 Rxe1+ 30. Qxe1`, Black can continue the attack with moves like `...Qf1+` or `...Qe2`. While these lines lead to a significant advantage for Black (e.g., `30... Qf1+ 31. Qxf1 Rxf1+ 32. Kh2 Ng4+ 33. hxg4 Rxd3`, winning the rook), the game is not over instantly.\n    *   An even stronger, and decisive, move for Black is the brilliant `28... Rd1!!`. This deflection tactic wins material immediately. For example: `29. Rxd1 Rxe1+ 30. Rxe1 Qxd1 31. Qxd1 Bxd1`, and Black is up a rook.\n    *   Despite the position being lost after `g1h1` against best play, it does not lead to an immediate forced checkmate like `g1f1` does. It forces the opponent to find the correct winning continuation and prolongs the game.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe move `g1f1` leads to a forced checkmate in 3 moves. The move `g1h1` leads to a lost position but avoids immediate mate and forces the opponent to continue playing accurately. In any chess game, avoiding a forced mate is the highest priority. Therefore, `g1h1` is the only correct and best move in this situation.\n\n```\ng1h1\n```"
