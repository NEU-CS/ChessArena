The board state indicates it is White's turn to move.\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n\n*   **White:** My king on d2 is extremely exposed and is currently in check by the Black queen on f2. This is the most critical feature of the position. My queen on g4 and bishop on g5 are active pieces, but king safety is the absolute priority. My rooks on e1 and g1 are also under pressure. The rook on e1 is attacked by the Black queen.\n*   **Black:** Black has a powerful attack. The queen on f2, supported by the knight on g6 and the rook on e8, creates immense threats. Black's king is relatively safe.\n\nMy primary goal must be to solve the king safety issue. I must respond to the check. The legal moves are `d2d1`, `d2c1`, `g4e2`, and `e1e2`.\n\n**Candidate Moves Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **`d2d1` (Kd1):** This move gets the king out of check, but it walks into other problems. The Black queen on f2 now attacks my rook on g1.\n    *   If Black plays `...Qxg1+`, I must respond `Kd2`. Then Black can play `...Qf2+`, forcing my king back to `d1`. This leads to a perpetual check and a draw.\n    *   However, Black has a much stronger move: `...Rxe1+`. After `Qxe1`, Black plays `...Qf1+`. I must play `Kd2`, then `...Qf2+`, `Kc1`. Now Black can play `...Ne5`, and my position collapses. The threats of `...Nf3+` and `...Nxd3` are overwhelming. `Kd1` is a losing move.\n\n2.  **`d2c1` (Kc1):** This moves the king to a seemingly safer square. However, the threats persist.\n    *   Black will almost certainly play `...Rxe1+`. I must recapture with `Qxe1`. The position becomes `r5k1/p4ppp/1p4n1/2p5/6Q1/P1PP2P1/2P2q2/2K1Q1R1 b - - 0 26`.\n    *   Although my king is on c1, Black's queen on f2 remains a monster. Black can continue the attack with `...Re8`, renewing pressure on the e-file, or `...Ne5`, attacking my queen and d-pawn. My position is still very difficult and dangerous.\n\n3.  **`e1e2` (Re2):** This move blocks the check with the rook.\n    *   Black will play `...Qxe2+`. I recapture with `Qxe2`. The position is `r3r1k1/p4ppp/1p4n1/2p5/8/P1PP2P1/2PKQ3/6R1 b - - 0 26`.\n    *   My king is still on d2, and while the immediate check is gone, the king remains a liability. My queen on e2 is more passive than it was on g4. Black can continue to press with `...Ne5`, attacking the d3 pawn and creating new threats. This is better than moving the king, but still leaves me under pressure.\n\n4.  **`g4e2` (Qe2):** This move blocks the check by offering a queen trade.\n    *   Black's best response is to accept the trade: `...Qxe2+`.\n    *   I will recapture, for instance with `Rxe2`. The position becomes `r3r1k1/p4ppp/1p4n1/2p5/8/P1PP2P1/2PKR3/6R1 b - - 0 26`.\n    *   This move radically changes the nature of the game. By trading queens, I have eliminated Black's most dangerous attacking piece. My king, while still on d2, is now much safer. The resulting endgame is complex, and Black may still have a slight edge due to the active knight and rook on the open e-file. However, I have survived the immediate crisis and have excellent chances to hold the position for a draw. This is by far the safest and most prudent option.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe moves `d2d1` and `d2c1` leave White in a perilous, likely losing position. The move `e1e2` is an improvement but still leaves White under significant pressure. The move `g4e2` is the best by a clear margin. It forces a queen trade, neutralizes Black's attack, and steers the game into a manageable endgame where my king is no longer in mortal danger. It is the only move that reliably secures my position.\n\n```\ng4e2\n```"
