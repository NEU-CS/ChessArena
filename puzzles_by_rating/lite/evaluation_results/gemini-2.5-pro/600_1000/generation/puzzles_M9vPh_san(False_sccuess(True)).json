When you have the advantage, press it relentlessly and aim for a swift checkmate. Carefully evaluate every move to eliminate any chance of a counterplay or draw by your opponent.\nWhen at a disadvantage, strive to turn the tide and win if possible. If victory is unattainable, exhaust all possible means to force a draw.\nMeticulously analyze legal moves, then select the absolute best one. You need to determine whether you are playing as Black or White. Then, you need to observe the positions of your pieces and choose one of your own pieces to move; make sure that your move follows the rules of chess.\n\nConsidering the long-term strategy and short-term tactic. Analyze the position carefully. You may think through the position and consider multiple candidate moves.\nWhen you have decided on your final move, output it in UCI notation (e.g., 'e2e4', 'g8f6' , 'e7e8q') in the following format:\n```\n<move>\n```\n\nNote: UCI notation represents chess moves using only start and end positions like \"e2e4\" or \"g1f3\", treating captures the same as regular moves without \"x\" or \"+\" symbols, and adds a letter like \"q\" for pawn promotion (e.g., \"e7e8q\").\n\nFor example:\n```\ne2e4\n```\nYou can think and reason as much as you want(step by step), but your final move must be formatted exactly as shown above.\nReminder of chess rules:\n- Bishops move diagonally.\n- Rooks move horizontally or vertically.\n- Knights jump in an L-shape.\n- Queens combine rook and bishop movement.\n- Kings move one square in any direction.\n- Pawns move forward, capture diagonally, and can promote.\n"

I must respond to this check.\n\n1.  **Analyze the check:** The White queen on c7 attacks my king on b8.\n    *   I cannot capture the queen on c7.\n    *   I cannot block the check by placing a piece between c7 and b8.\n    *   Therefore, I must move my king.\n\n2.  **Evaluate King Moves:**\n    *   The squares a7 and c8 are also controlled by the White queen on c7.\n    *   The only available square for my king to move to is a8.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Legal Moves:** The only legal move available to me is `b8a8`. Since it is the only move I can make, it is by definition the best move.\n\n4.  **Analyze the position after the move:**\n    *   After `1... Ka8`, my king is temporarily safe. However, White has a forced checkmating sequence.\n    *   White will play `2. Qc8+`.\n    *   I am forced to play `2... Ka7`.\n    *   White continues with `3. Qa8+`.\n    *   I am forced to capture with `3... Kxa8`.\n    *   White delivers the final blow with `4. b7#`, which is checkmate.\n\nDespite the fact that the position is lost for Black, the rules of chess dictate that I must make a legal move. As there is only one legal move, I must play it.\n\n```\nb8a8\n```"
